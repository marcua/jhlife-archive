				<strong>We will tell you how you can help tame this threat, but first the details.</strong><br /><br />It&#039;s no secret that high-rises well above the six-stories that&#039;s been the max in Jackson Heights will be rising here. At least five buildings that would break though that ceiling are proposed, approved or under construction - including two 13-story buildings - a photo of one we&#039;ve attached here. The Jackson Heights Beautification Group (JHBG) the Queensboro Houses Association and others included at least one elected official are pushing city government act on our seven-year-old application to expand the existing landmark district before it is too late. <br /><br />First, let&#039;s get one thing out of the way.&nbsp; We are not trying to freeze all development or prevent new housing from being built. We will explain later,&nbsp; but back to the threat.<br /><br />We&#039;ve already seen massive development in Long Island City and part of Astoria, as well as Flushing and other parts of Queens, now it appears to be JH&#039;s turn. <strong>Several months ago a developer bought two, two-story brick buildings on 89th Street off 37th Avenue and filed plans to put up a nine-story building there. This should SCARE you if like JH&#039;s planned mix of smaller buildings with apartment buildings because this is the first time developers bought multi-family buildings in Jackson Heights in order to tear them down to put up much bigger structures.</strong> <br /><br />Think about this: these will not contain so-called affordable apartments (even those not affordable for most local renters,) but they will burden our local infrastructure: our already crowded transit system, parks, schools and streets.<br /><br />As we said above landmarking does not halt development, witness the six-story building that went up on 37th Avenue near 84th Street a few years back or &quot;Kelly&#039;s Manor,&quot; a five-story building to replace a one-story structure already approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. <br /><br />What land DOES do is it requires new buildings to fit in with the character of our neighborhood. The fact is<br />the buildings and their gardens outside the historic district are of the same high quality of the buildings designated as an historic district in 1993.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>How you can help:</strong><br />Remember, complaining about how bad this is on this or other site won&#039;t help.<br />Instead, contact Landmarks Preservation Commission Executive Director, Sarah Carroll.<br />1. Place &quot;Expand the Jackson Heights Historic District&quot; in subject line or atop your letter. <br />2. Tell her know why the landmark extension is important to you. USE YOUR OWN WORDS, but you may want to cover some of these ideas: <br />* The buildings in the proposed district extension are just as worthy as those within the existing district. <br />* Jackson Heights&#039; architecture and building gardens create a distinctive and beautiful community appreciated by NYC’s most diverse population.<br />You can email her at: scarroll@lpc.nyc.gov<br /><br />and please copy us at expandJHdistrict@gmail.com<br /><br />Or write her at: <br />NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission Executive Director Sarah Carroll.<br />The Municipal Building<br />1 Centre Street, 9th Floor North<br />New York, NY 10007<br /><br />

				How can a person write a letter to support this proposal if I have no idea what this new proposed landmark district looks like? You show a building under construction on 72nd Street that also shows some siding clad wood houses. Are these the homes that you view as landmark worthy? The ominous word “threat” seems to imply some scare tactics from the 1950’s red scare.

In Queens, the net effective median rent fell 11.7 percent year over year to $2,646, marking the eighth decline in the past nine months.<br />The year-over-year size of concessions went up in both boroughs as well. It increased to 1.8 months from 1.4 months in Brooklyn, and rose to 1.6 months from 1.1 months in Queens.&quot;<br /><br />The article attributes these drops primarily to all of the new developments (esp the concessions).<br /><br />We&#039;ve been in a period of incredible increases for a number of years because inventory (especially for starter-level homes) has been very low. Thus competition has driven up sale prices and rents.&nbsp; Might finally start coming back to earth as more inventory becomes available and changes to tax code alters incentives for homeowners.

				Wow. Glad there is so much interest in this issue.<br /><br />It can get a little complicated. What landmarking does and DOES NOT do is often misunderstood. As we said in our initial post - landmarking does NOT freeze development in a historic district. In the third paragraph above I promised a further explanation, which I provided in paragraphs six and seven (copied below.) <br /><br /><em>As we said above landmarking does not halt development, witness the six-story building that went up on 37th Avenue near 84th Street a few years back or &quot;Kelly&#039;s Manor,&quot; a five-story building to replace a one-story structure already approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. <br /><br />What land(marking) DOES do is it requires new buildings to fit in with the character of our neighborhood. The fact is the buildings and their gardens outside the historic district are of the same high quality of the buildings designated as an historic district in 1993.&nbsp; <br /></em><br /><br />A couple of other points. Yes large parts of Manhattan and some other scattered parts of NYC are vertical, but clearly that&#039;s not the entire case. Large parts of Brooklyn and some significant parts of Manhattan are of equal or lower density than Jackson Heights and some of these are protected by historic districts --- exactly the designation we are seeking. Much of Jackson Height from 69th Street to 91st Street was placed on the National Historic Register, while only the core area actually received officials NYC historic designation then.<br /><br />Also, I will get a map showing the proposed district up on this site in the next day or two.<br />know.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t answered everyone&#039;s question, but we are just beginning the campaign. Many of you know the Jackson Heights Beautification Group. We were established in the late 1980s when JH was in some deep trouble and the organization deserves some credit for helping turn the neighborhood around. We are a civic, environmental, arts and educational organization made up of all volunteers, which is why I need to get back to work and cannot answer more questions now. <br /><br />In closing I want to get across this point: Communities are more than just the buildings and people who live there. They are a kind of ecosystem, made up of rich relationships developed over time between the built and among the environment the people who live there. As we learned from massive redevelopment and urban renewal in the 1950, &#039;60s and &#039;70s, you can&#039;t just sweep away neighborhoods, rebuild and then expect healthy communities (read Jane Jacobs.) Especially not neighborhoods that serve a broad mix of ethnicities and economic levels that is Jackson Heights. But without protection (which is merited by our architecture) much of Jackson Heights will be lost<br /><br />Finally, and this is not meant as a put down of the Brooklyn neighborhood, but we don&#039;t need a Williamsburg in Queens. Jackson Heights is a pretty special place as it is. Thank you for reading to the end.

				and if we had hundreds of acres of disused industrial wasteland running along Northern or Roosevelt, 40 story glass towers might be an improvement. having lived over there in the mid 80s, i&#039;m still not so sure -- because, as Captain Flannel noted, most of the longterm residents aren&#039;t seeing any quality of life boost at all. if you&#039;re a working class person, you can only derive so much pleasure from watching someone eat a $32 piece of fish in your backyard.

				City and part of Astoria, as well as Flushing and other parts of Queens, now it appears to be JH&#039;s turn. Several months ago a developer bought two, two-story brick buildings on 89th Street off 37th Avenue and filed plans to put up a nine-story building there. This should SCARE you if like JH&#039;s planned mix of smaller buildings with apartment buildings because this is the first time developers bought multi-family buildings in Jackson Heights in order to tear them down to put up much bigger structures. <br /><br />The above is not a true statement. On 73rd Street between 37th Ave and Broadway there used to be 6 multiple family homes in the middle of the block that were torn down to put up 5 to 8 story residential and commercial buildings. In fact there is another house that has its utilities cut and about to be demolished. Do you believe that any of those homes were landmark worthy? <br /><br />This seems less about trying to save some minor architectural detail and more about NIMBYism. You state that the community should decide what the building looks like. Absent this landmarking the developer hires an architect and builds what the zoning allows. It may done in the new international style and not neo-Georgian style. <br />&nbsp;

				To folks who say they want more housing - for the last time: Landmarking does not stop new housing. So you could go on and on about the need for more housing here, but that has nothing to do with this post.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has a lot of housing packed into small space.&nbsp; <strong>The 11372 zip code already has one of the highest population densities in NYC and the nation</strong> - it just doesn&#039;t feel like it because it was wisely planned.

				Exactly.&nbsp; Jackson Heights was wisely planned.&nbsp; Its appeal stems from the fact that it was wisely planned and has a pretty much unified aesthetic.&nbsp; What a shame it would be if that aesthetic was lost.&nbsp; Take a stroll through Astoria and the unattractive mishmash of architecture that exists there.&nbsp; Take a stroll through Flushing......if you can make your way through the overcrowded streets.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to know the historic district of Jackson Heights as it exists now should remain intact, but wouldn&#039;t it be nice to protect the entire area from Roosevelt to Northern and the BQE to Junction Blvd?&nbsp; I certainly think so.

				In this expanded district it would include many new buildings that are not historic. Many of the large apartment buildings are old and ugly looking square boxes. This expanded district would cheapen the current historic district. It seems silly to claim that modern buildings are poorly made. All of these older buildings have old electric, plumbing and old elevators that create a fire hazard.&nbsp;

				So is the proposal really to make nearly the entire neighborhood a historic district? That makes no sense just by the landmarking standards given how many different types of buildings from different eras that already exist.<br /><br />And it&#039;s important to remember that making something a historic district favors one set of aesthetic standards over others that people may desire for their own property. Then you have unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats enforcing a bunch of rules, many of which will seem arbitrary. <br /><br />This goes way beyond limiting the size and design of new buildings to include very detailed restrictions on awnings, signs, cornices and on and on. Don&#039;t see the need for this at all.<br /><br />And Jeanette, if there is any data source that you would believe that indicate that median rents in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and NW Queens have stabilized and even started creeping down, then let me know what that is. It&#039;s been talked about for over a year now all over the place...google will find you multiple sources. it was the inevitable consequence of thousands of new units coming on the market simultaneously.

				All this talk about how great Jackson Heights is planned.<br /><br />Yes, the historic district is uniform and attractive.<br /><br />But the hard truth is, apart from the private gardens, Jackson Heights has minimal open space/parkland compared with pretty much every other neighborhood in NYC.<br /><br />The smart thing would be to work with the developers and remedy that situation. <br /><br />They can build their towers... and in turn create public parkland/open spaces for us in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />This has been successfully achieved elsewhere.<br /><br />Folks are dissing Williamsburg...but that situation is already here in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Where people who can&#039;t afford to live in complexes with private gardens can only glimpse into those paradises... and merely dream of open spaces for themselves. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Roosevelt Terrace comes to mind as the biggest example (and perhaps Donner Gardens as well, I&#039;m not clear if that is in the historic district). There are other examples of 1950s post-war buildings throughout the neighborhood that were built on during the post-WWII housing boom - if I understand the history correctly - the community gardens that had been part of the original plan for the neighborhood. So, the criteria for the historic boundaries doesn&#039;t appear to have been a lack of non-historic buildings.

				The problem with increased development, especially residential development, is that neighborhoods don&#039;t always have the infrastructure to accommodate more people.&nbsp; For years we had schools holding classes in old closets and bathrooms.&nbsp; There were just not enough schools.&nbsp; To its credit, the city went on a school building spree in our community, but they were entirely public and intermediate schools.&nbsp; Where will these children go to high school.&nbsp; And can our schools handle a new wave of children?<br /><br />The same with transportation.&nbsp; People have mentioned Williamsburg, but the subway infrastructure there was never designed to handle the new population.&nbsp; And when all those new buildings in LIC start to fill up our subway lines will become even more crowded.<br /><br />My point is, planning should include more than just increasing residential capacity.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The idea is NOT to make all of JH a historic district, just that portion developed under the plan by Edward MacDougall and Queensboro Houses.<br />The buildings in the proposed expansion areas are pretty much of equal quality to those in the already landmarked district. That&#039;s why they are on the National Register of Historic Places. (A great honor, but it doesn&#039;t protect anything.)<br />The strange thing about people clamoring for high rises in JH (11372), they seem to be under the impression that we are an inappropriately low-density developed area. <br />Zip code 11372 is a VERY HIGH POPULATION DENSITY neighborhood, one of the densest in the nation. It just doesn&#039;t feel like it because it was well-planned with a mix apartment buildings, private homes and gardens.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Yeah, what could go wrong with allowing developers to run roughshod over a carefully planned neighborhood? <br />Ciao!

Landmark status does not increase the parking requirements for new construction or requires more gardens. That is the role of the NYC planning commission who oversees the zoning law and its requirements for certain areas based on density. I think your complaint should be with them. As far as parking requirements, I believe the city is moving away from requiring parking near major subway stations. The belief is you don’t need a car.

				within five years, we&#039;ll be hemmed in on all sides by high rises (that one didn&#039;t replace housing, it&#039;s going up on what used to be a one-story retail strip and church). the current historic district is unlikely to be touched, but unbroken 10-12 story buildings on all sides? with proposed amenities like public space that -- if Manhattan is the blueprint -- will be yanked off the table once building is complete? no thanks.

				If the historic district is not expanded, couldn&#039;t high rises start popping up at 75th and 89th streets and south of 37th Avenue just outside the boundaries of the current historic district?&nbsp; If that happens, the feel of the current historic district will be destroyed.&nbsp; Seems to me the expansion would only encompass a few blocks west of 76th, and few blocks east of 88th and the block between 37th Avenue and Roosevelt.&nbsp; Seems like a no-brainer to me.

				To answer your question hum@njukebox1 - YES.<br /><br />And just to clarify, before anyone accuses us of being disingenuous. By high-rises we are not talking about 20, 30, 40-story buildings, but only what is permitted by current zoning. And in the case of what is proposed for the expansion area on 89th Street, that&#039;s nine stories - approximately four times taller than the neighboring two story buildings. Finally the proposed expansion would only touch Roosevelt Avenue in a few spots.<br /><br />Happy Mothers Day to all mothers and anyone whoever had a mother!

				FYI, there&#039;s a page on the Jackson Heights Wiki about Roosevelt Parc at Roosevelt Avenue and the BQE (see https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Roosevelt_Parc (https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Roosevelt_Parc)). As the &quot;Parc&quot; impinges on my view of the sky more each day, I&#039;m no lover. But,<br /><br />...considering its proximity to Diversity Plaza (see https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Diversity_Plaza), perhaps a civic evangelist might extrapolate on the co-habitation potential and draw the Roosevelt Parc developer, Friends of Diversity Plaza, and the broader neighborhood into a planning process.

				The NYC planning commission is the body that controls zoning, parking, how high you can build, how much garden you need to have. You have to get Dromm to get them to down zone Jackson Heights. This will eliminate all these big towers. This whole landmark the entire neighborhood is just silly.

				There are no mansions in Jackson Heights. While many of the homes are lovely, by no stretch of the imagination could they be described as mansions. Some of the nicer homes are attached or semi-attached, which seems rather contrary to the idea of what a mansion is.<br /><br />Google can be very helpful when you&#039;re trying to find information. I&#039;m not sure if this is the proposed expansion of the historic district, or even outlines the historic district correctly, but given what I&#039;ve heard about the interest in expanding the historic district, this may be it:<br />http://architecturaltrust.org/~architec/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Map_Jackson_Heights.jpg (http://architecturaltrust.org/~architec/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Map_Jackson_Heights.jpg)<br />

				That area is zoned R5 but most of the houses have been converted to Doctors offices which is allowed under zoning laws. Same as a church. That has been like that for thirty years. The parking lot is only allowed by special permit which is backed by Dromm (and predecessors) who has his office next door. I don’t agree that it should be allowed. It is a commercial use in a R5 zone. Those houses have already been converted so it is too late.

I haven&#039;t liked seeing all of this overdevelopment wherever it&#039;s occurred. Mostly for the reason stated above, but also because the new housing is for higher-income people (unless the developer has one of those deals where a few apartments need to be set aside for lower-income residents, in exchange for being allowed to build a taller building or get some other break). And having taller buildings go up creates massive construction that can seriously damage surrounding properties (I saw this not just in Williamsburg, where my friends and the developer who built an apartment building next to theirs have been locked in legal battles for years now, but also in Park Slope). After which the people in nearby low-rise buildings have their views and sunlight blocked. <br />

				Hello all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve attached a map showing the bounds of the proposed extensions of the Jackson Heights Historic District. The extensions contain the diagonal lines. The outermost line marks the area listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The dark gray area is the existing district. As you can see the proposed areas avoid new construction and buildings of &quot;lesser architectural quality&quot; that so concerned several.<br /><br />Speaking of lesser quality, I&#039;m not sure how legible the map&#039;s details are because of the 128 KB limit on images here. You can see the higher res version here - www.facebook.com/JacksonHeightsHistoric/ . <br /><br /><strong>BTW, you can help preserve one of NYC&#039;s highest density neighborhoods in a form that doesn&#039;t feel crowded by contacting the Landmark Preservation Commission&#039;s Executive Director Sarah Carroll at scarroll@lpc.nyc.gov <br /><br />This will take one minute, pretty much regardless of your computer skills</strong><br /><br />Please put <strong>Expand the Jackson Heights Historic District</strong> in the subject line. You may want to say something along the following lines below. Key points: 1) the expanded district&#039;s proposed buildings are just as high quality as the current district. 2) these distinct buildings and their generous open space are endangered by development.&nbsp; <br /><br />I urge the Landmarks Preservation Commission to extend<br />the Jackson Heights Historic District. Our goal is to<br />preserve the buildings developed contemporaneously<br />with the landmarked central core of Jackson Heights.<br /><strong>These buildings were built to the same planning and<br />architectural standards, and they complement the scale<br />and character of the existing Historic District. This new<br />designation is urgently needed, as a series of large, out-of-character <br />developments have recently been proposed in or near the proposed extension.<br /></strong><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">And thank you all for the great discussion and support.

				I really don’t have any vehement opposition to the expansion but I did notice some odd things. That whole appendix looking thing around 73rd Street includes the old converted movie theater which has just been modified. There is nothing worthwhile to save at that location.&nbsp; Also a funny inclusion is Apna Bazzar. That building is garbage. <br /><br />

				I support expanding the boundaries of this LPC-designated historic district, but also know it&#039;s not the only tool in our toolbox. Landmarking is a difficult (but not unattainable! just difficult) route for a few reasons. Firstly, the current chair of the LPC has given notice, so the department is going to be going through a period of adjustment for who knows how long while a long-term replacement is found. Obviously the staffers will continue to do their jobs, but it does change the overall attitude and tone of the LPC as a whole. Secondly, while I love every little historic wood-frame building in our neighborhood and (personally) wish we could save them all forever, many of them don&#039;t have enough historic significance to be protected by the LPC. Trust me, I work in the field, and you would be amazed at the beautiful buildings the LPC deems &quot;not worthy&quot; and allows developers to demolish.<br /><br />That all being said, I will support any effort to expand the JH historic district, but think other approaches have merit as well. The best tool to fight out-of-context development (like that ginormous building going up at 72nd) is to change the <strong>zoning</strong>. The current zoning for JH can be found here http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/zoning/zoning-maps/map9d.pdf (http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/zoning/zoning-maps/map9d.pdf) and information on what that all means is here http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/zoning-maps.page (http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/zoning-maps.page). I&#039;m not an expert at reading those things, but I hope this might be helpful to JHBG and other concerned neighbors.

				i&#039;m sure some of the residents in the proposed expansion area don&#039;t like the idea. a large percentage of those in the current historic district objected to it being put into place as well. there will always be a fight over things like this.

				Right now, residents in Queens have very little to negotiate with. We already have a nine-story building going up by right next to two-story houses on 89th Street. What kind of meaningful open space could be obtained by granting another four or five stories on top of what would already be too tall by many people.&nbsp; What could we get by granting an additional four stories to the 13-story just south of B-way near the BQE. <br />The kind of developments that result in significant open space cover larger footprints and are much taller. <br />Also one point that is missed when we are talking about building more housing. Rents in new construction is far more expensive than what exists; it does nothing for providing affordable housing.<br />Landmarking does give a community some leverage in negotiating. <br />Finally, two quick points that many do not understand: Historic districts do not prevent new housing. Second Jackson Heights (11372) is already one of the densest neighborhoods in New York City and the nation. <br />All the best!<br />

				What you want is a re-zoning if the neighborhood so the area gets down zoned from a R7 to a R4. This whole historic district is just a way to try to go around the NYC planning commission. There are a number of homes that have replaced their slate roofs and wood windows so you punish new homeowners who want to upgrade their inefficient homes. A slate roof could cost $50,000 for some these houses.

				Tell you what, JK Resident. You work on the zone change. We&#039;ll support you. <br />Meanwhile we&#039;ll work on landmarking because we want to preserve the character of JH. $50,000 for a new roof? That&#039;s cheaper than non-landmark roofs. Also, LPC doesn&#039;t not require slate if the substitute looks good. They don&#039;t even require that on individual landmarked buildings.<br />

				I don’t have to work on a zoning change. Dromm has to request the NYC planning commission start one. Since he controls purse of NYC that should be easy. That is the work of paid professionals. Since the main idea of your group is to prevent 15 story buildings your group of die hard preservationists should push for both ideas. I really don’t care about either idea. I believe that the city needs more housing and would rather see new buildings than the current rundown homes that infest our neighborhood.

An essential aspect of the neighborhood is that it is a neighborhood of lots of six story apartment buildings. R4 also requires off-street parking for every dwelling unit. That&#039;s ridiculous! In a 48-unit apartment building, they&#039;d have to, what, install a parking lot? Build a garage? I don&#039;t get where you&#039;re coming from at all. R4 zoning for the neighborhood would completely shatter the character I and many others came to Jackson Heights to enjoy - a dense, walkable, transit-focused neighborhood of well-kept co-ops.<br /><br />If you want a neighborhood that&#039;s all little houses, move to Bayside.

				I don’t care about tall buildings going up replacing these wooden crummy houses. This group that wants to eliminate 15 story buildings does. Look at the picture posted. R4 could be zoned around the area where there are houses so they are not demolished to build a 15 story. Other areas could be zoned R5, R6, etc. This is the real goal that this group aims to achieve. This whole Landmarking is a red herring for wanting to down zone Jackso n Heights. Obviously existing buildings would be exempt from these zoning laws.

				<br /><br /><br />So, we are going to allow the owner of the parking lot on 75th Street to build much higher if he builds us a community room or a very small park? Why not let that person just build what current zoning allows and not add to the congestion for some minimal neighborhood amenities that few would enjoy. There is nothing that will require they to build higher so all this is just speculation. How about letting the owner continuing to rent out the land for parking?

				Jackson Heights is a special place. It’s one of NYC’s densest neighborhoods, but it doesn’t feel crowded. That’s because it was well planned, with plenty of gardens around its buildings.<br /><br />Here’s how you can help protect Jackson Heights from rampant development: <br />Send an email to NYC Landmark Preservation Commission&#039;s Executive Director Sarah Carroll at scarroll@lpc.nyc.gov, urging the LPC to expand the district. <br /><br />Please put <em>Expand the Jackson Heights Historic District</em> in the subject line and include these points: 1) the proposed expansion’s buildings are just as high quality as the current district. 2) these distinct buildings and their generous open space are endangered by encroaching development. 3) We applied for the expansion in 2011 and it’s time for LPC to hold a hearing on this proposal. And don’t forget to thank her. <br /><br />JHBG is working with elected officials and other organizations to expand the landmark district to include the almost all of area planned of Jackson Heights’ developer Edward A. McDougall and his Queensboro Corporation. <br /><br /><strong>BTW, to those who&#039;ve raised questions about our strategy, we are not talking about protecting wooden boxes. That is just silly. We are talking about protecting substantial brick well-designed buildings (left photo.) So please stop introducing red herrings into the discussion.<br /><br />If folks are interested in a zone change or negotiating to get open space, why don&#039;t you folks work on this. Please keep us apprised and perhaps we can lend some help.<br />JHBG decided to work on expanding the historic district some time ago. We made the application for the expansion in 2011; had a meeting with LPC chair in 2015 and recently decided to step up campaign.<br /><br />We work full-time at jobs to support ourselves and families. (I&#039;m sending this message from my office, so shhhhh, no snitching.) We have no magic wand to make things happen, and if is not clear yet, we are not paid to do this. We are just regular folks working together to get things done for the community. We welcome you working with us. We welcome you working separately. I guess the key word is work.

This street is not even included on the proposed expansion! You admit that this house is not important, so why are trying to protect it. The new homes built by Manhasset homes is what the current zoning allows in a R5 area. You should try to advocate for a R5A district. The new contextual designation of R5A or R7A allows development but only if it co forms with the surrounding buildings. This is what the group really want. Again what the group really wants is to down zone Jackson Heights and not preserve anything historic.

				Creating new housing doesn&#039;t mean destroying everything in its path. It should be compatible in scale.

Six story apartment buildings in JH are not the same as these high rise monstrosities&nbsp; that are going up.&nbsp; The JH transit hub provides easy access to the city ( if your into congestion and crowds) and an escape from the city.&nbsp; If people are complaining about the MTA, it&#039;s because the infra structure was never designed to&nbsp; be used by so many people.

				Good point, lalo.<br />The area that I&#039;ve been referring to (and tried to regularly cite this in my posts) is zip code 11372, the part of JH south of Northern Boulevard, which roughly corresponds to the area included on National Register of Places and the MacDougall development plan. Once you go north of Northern, the density drops dramatically. It&#039;s mostly two-story buildings, so that would pull down the overall densite. <br />I thought I had posted the source here.

				As far as expanding the district to include 6 story buildings, I don’t see a problem. Some of the houses that your map wants to preserve seem in poor shape and lack any architectural detail. So what if our neighborhood is dense. Why should it not be more dense? Are you claiming that the sewer , electric grid, schools can’t handle any more buildings.

Aside from the architectural merit, my thinking is: we are a dense neighborhood, but it doesn&#039;t feel it AND that&#039;s a tribute to the original plan for JH.

				This whole argument of there being too many residents in Jackson Heights on sidewalks to walk is pretty silly. Just take another street if this bugs you. I don’t believe there has been a building boom in the area so the increase is not from new construction but from more people subdividing their apartment or houses. Jackson Heights has one of the highest rates of unrelated people living together. I believe the real reason there are so many people is that DOB does not enforce the laws and we are overrun with illegals conversions. This whole argument supports a modification of our zoning laws but not an expansion of the historic district.

				More foot traffic on one commercial street leading to the subway is generally a healthy sign, because it&#039;s good for business and safety.

				With CBTC control of all our trains soon the MTA will be able to expand capacity dramatically without building a new tunnel. The 7 line will get it later this year with the Queens Blvd line next.

The whole idea that the new construction is of poor quality while being highly regulated is laughable.

				<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">JK resident, <br />You don&#039;t have to support the extension of the landmark district, but at least be fair.<br />Suggesting that these new big buildings are going to house immigrant families is fantasy; they are being built for affluent people regardless of where they come from. In fact the new buildings are more likely to replace rental apartments where immigrant families live - and trigger a wave of gentrification. <br />You are trying to slime supporters of the landmark expansion by saying we are white affluent people trying to keep immigrant families out of new housing. JHBG, an all-volunteer organization, has long been a champion of a diverse community and we provide programs for all of our people, regardless of ethnicity, language, income, sexuality and age. Have you seen the cross section of our community who participates in our Halloween Parade, Summer Sundays in the Park, our student art contest, our volunteers greening programs, who it is that plays in Travers Park where we have worked for nearly 30 years to improve? <br />Instead you call us anti-immigrant, apparently including those of us who came from other countries or whose parents came from other countries. It&#039;s an old trick and you aren&#039;t fooling anyone.<br />Our members, supporters and volunteers, including those backing the landmark extension, reflect all who live in JH. We are working people whose kids go to public schools. Clearly you don&#039;t know who we are and you don&#039;t care who our programs serve, but that doesn&#039;t stop you from spouting off. I&#039;d offer to sit down with you to discuss this matter, but you seem intent on demonizing those who disagree with you.<br />All the best.<br /></span>

				New housing is being all over LIC and Astoria were the city sets aside as a condition to receive bonds and tax abatements a certain number of apartments for people of middle and low income. They also take account of family size. If you expand the historic district the current low density areas of Jackson Heights will be practically off limits for development. It will be impossible to demolish any of the existing structures. This will drive up the value of existing housing because no new housing will ever be allowed. This is why in Manhattan there is no construction in historic districts. If you feel the current zoning allows out of scale development then you should push to make all zoning contextual (ie R7 to R7A). This would provide more front gardens and setbacks.

				JK Resident,<br /><br />I notice no apology or admission that you were just making things up last night in order to smear the campaign to expand the Jackson Heights historic district. <br /><br />And now you are making things up about affordable housing being built when bulldozers roll into Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Affordable housing being built in LIC, in what is considered the most massive development/redevelopment project in the nation??? There were ZERO affordable housing units built or planned in the redevelopment of Long Island City when I wrote a report for Metro New York a year and a half ago. If it&#039;s changed since then, I&#039;d be happy to hear of it because it is needed. At that time there were 6,000 units built and another 16,000 planned for the massive market-driven development along Jackson Avenue and around Queensborough Plaza. (The waterfront development is a different kind of animal it was organized by the New York State.) <br /><br />Also you refuse to acknowledge that a historic district does not prevent new construction. We had a new six-story building put up on 37th Avenue a few years ago and a five-story building is planned there too, both replacing one-story structures. Historic district status requires that new construction be in character with the surrounding neighborhood.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights (zip code, 11372) is already one of the densest neighborhoods in NYC; it was well planned; it has distinctive architecture; it&#039;s on the U.S. Register of Historic Places. Put hey, it&#039;s in Queens so lets make some big bucks.</strong><br /><br />Another fantasy you wrote about last night was that the new subway computerized signaling system would solve our transit crowding problems. If I remember correctly, this improvement will result in a roughly 10 percent increase in subway service during rush hours, maybe keeping up with the ridership growth that we&#039;ve had in the last 20 years&nbsp; due to new construction in Queens, and doing nothing to account for future construction.<br /><br />It will NOT provide subway service in the vast parts of Queens that are a transit dessert. These folks need to take buses to get to the 7 Train or the Queens Boulevard lines. A new subway line would serve these folks and lessen the load on the above subway lines. <br /><strong><br />Well that&#039;s it. I don&#039;t have time to keep fact-checking the stuff you put out. Perhaps we should just ignore it.</strong>

				You are clearly hysterical when you state bulldozers will roll into Jackson Heights. The vast majority of JH is already developed. No one is going to tear down six story apartment buildings to put up a new seven or eight story buildings. This is obviously a red scare tactic to prevent construction of any new housing. There are a group of historic junkies that want to control the appearance of any new construction. That new apartment building was allowed only after a tragic fire required the demolition of the old structure. People just want to control other people. The vast majority of buildings outside the historic district are ugly old brick boxes that do not deserve any protection.

				it&#039;s kind of in line with the micro-apartment micro-trend, which has popped up here and there in brooklyn and manhattan. tiny studios at exorbitant prices, which should be lower out here.<br /><br />https://ny.curbed.com/2017/12/8/16751842/brooklyn-micro-apartments-for-rent-fort-greene

Regarding the average of 400 square feet, the article says, &quot;150 apartments will result, averaging 400 square feet apiece, indicating rental or possibly hotel use.&quot; IMO, this is not a good sign. So many new hotels in outer borough neighborhoods end up being used by the city to house people who can&#039;t be accommodated by the over-capacity shelters.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t a hotel require different permits than a residential building? I&#039;m not really sure I understand how permits could be filed with no requirement that the applicant say what the building&#039;s use will be.<br /><br />https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/06/permits-filed-for-91-09-roosevelt-avenue-jackson-heights-queens.html

				i don&#039;t read that as &quot;this will be a hotel,&quot; but as &quot;this will be an alternative place for the city to place people who might be placed in hotels.&quot; the zoning for a hotel would definitely be different, but don&#039;t think they&#039;d need any building variance to allow the placement of people in need.

				It is only fair that Jackson Heights accept its share of homeless. They all can’t live on 57th Steeet. There are also a lot of immigrant men who need a small space to live while they work to send money back home. Unfortunately this brings lots of prostitution and other services for these hard working migrants.

				IMHO, hotels are not really the best place for the homeless, so I can understand why some people here may not be thrilled with the possibility of this being a hotel. Assisted housing run by some nonprofit groups where homeless folks can live in a helping community that provides real services is what works. From my reporting experience, when these places are well run and not focused on profits, they don&#039;t negatively affect neighborhoods.
