				It appears Cedar Court is removing portions of the decorative Spanish Tile roof (specifically the trim on the 35th Ave facade at the 83rd street and 84th street corners). The 84th street corner is now under plastic and the 83rd street corner section appears to be completely gone.&nbsp; Does anyone know if they have appropriate approval from the landmark preservation council?

				If so,&nbsp; there should be a publically displayed permit from Landmarks.&nbsp; This is the building that destroyed the mortar between the bricks and took away the hanging dolphin from the archway at the entrance so any thing is possible.&nbsp; Call 311 and report it to the city and to Landmarks.

				I live across the street from Cedar Court and I, too, am curious as to what is going on under all that white netting. To hear that they are removing yet another of its distinctive features is disturbing. I often wonder what this building looked like before they damaged the brickwork (why?!) and removed the hanging dolphin (wowâ€”does anyone have a picture?).

				I remember the dolphin. The condition of the tile roof until now was a nightmare waiting for litigation, or worse, although further destruction of our neighborhood&#039;s character also borders on tragic. Does anyone know whether there are genuine disincentives to any owner for destroying a building&#039;s original architectural specs? Are there penalties or fines for violating those features that make buildings landmarks? Unfortunately, the large number of, say, poorly re-pointed mortar jobs in JH suggests the historic district regulations are relatively toothless. What else can be done besides calling 3-1-1 (which in my experience has only served as a registry for complaints rather than an agency to resolve them)?

				I spoke with a woman at the Landmark Commission. The building has permits to restore and replace the tile. Hopefully, they abide by them.

				Looks like they removed about a foot or two from the top of the building all around.&nbsp; Given the poor work done on this building over the years I am not optimistic - permits or not.
