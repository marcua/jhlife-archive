				From Assemblyman Den Dekker:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Attempted Child Abduction</span></strong><br /><br />If you have ANY information please call the 115 Pct immediately 718-533-2003<br /><br />An incident occurred in the confines of the 115th Precinct this morning at approximately 0745 hours a 10 year old female was walking to Renaissance School (81 Street/37 Avenue) within the confines of the 115th Precinct, when a M/H perp in is 30&#039;s, 6&quot;2&quot; 200 pounds, wearing a green vest, black pants, black skull hat, and a blue packpack, called the girl from the other side of street and waved for her to come towards him. The girl was frightened and ran towards the School Crossing Guard on the corner. As the girl began to run towards the crossing guard, the perpetrator ran across the street and attempted to grab her. No contact was made, and there were no injuries. The 115th Precinct Squad is working on a wanted flyer right now, and I will get it out as soon as it is done.

				WTF<br /><br />Glad they have him in custody and the girl is safe<br /><br />Between this, the 14 million dollar heroin seizure a couple days ago, murders from 2015, this shit is getting real in the heights! <br /><br />Many Positives to note but kinda scary as a resident...

				Gosh, my first take on this was this was a case of street harassment. Attempted abduction?? So glad a suspect is in custody. I hope the kid gets whatever help she needs to feel safe again.

				It&#039;s great that the video was high quality, and that they were able to pick this guy up so quickly!&nbsp; &nbsp;Watching this footage is disturbing, that crossing guard should be commended.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;This is the best outcome possible at this point for a situation that could&#039;ve ended far worse. And can we note<br />here that a real live person -in the form of the crossing guard -was the safe place this wise girl ran towards. We<br />have been putting us so many other traffic obstacles but I personally think we need more real live people as<br />crossing guards in our communities. What&#039;s the issue with hiring these people vs. so many blinking lights and bumps in the street? Seems to me it&#039;s time to bring back more of these wonderful guards back as they keep us<br />safe in so many ways.
