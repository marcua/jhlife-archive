				A local artist received a grant from the City called the City Artist Corps grant. She&#039;s using her grant towards doing a one time open studio/talk for teens and young adults so they can learn about &quot;Art As a Path.&quot; She lives in the area (not JH but nearby) so feel free to check out her website to see some of her work, or if you&#039;re looking for local creatives to follow on IG, she&#039;s at @sandramackval . If you have questions, she&#039;s the best one to ask via email, but I&#039;m also happy to try to help.<br /><br /><strong>Art As A Path </strong>: Free art event for teens in Long Island City art studio. <br /><br /><strong>What:</strong>&nbsp; &quot;Art As A Path&quot; is a fun and informal art studio visit plus an open talk/conversation with teens and young adults. The talk would be centered on the idea that it IS possible to follow your call for art as a profession.<br />Light refreshments will be served.<br />Covid 19 safety guidelines are encouraged. Artist is fully vaccinated.<br /><br /><strong>When:</strong> Saturday October 16th from 3pm-6pm.&nbsp; The studio will be open during this time for parents and teens to visit.&nbsp; At 4pm we will have the talk/conversation, followed by a Q&amp;A.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Where:</strong> In the artist&#039;s studio, located in Long Island City near 24th street and 37th Ave., so you can experience what&#039;s like to be in an artist&#039;s&nbsp; place of work. Once you RSVP, you will be sent the full address.<br /><br /><strong>Who:</strong>&nbsp; Sandra Mack-Valencia, a professional full time artist. Interested in sharing her experience and encouraging young creative minds to follow their vocation.&nbsp; http://www.SandraMackValencia.com<br /><br />**Space is limited. First come first served.&nbsp; Please RSVP by emailing directly to sapmack@yahoo.com&nbsp; <br /><br />(https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.icompendium.com/sites/sandram1/bg/2345820_VerticalCommunitiesinMyStudio.jpg?5ce90eb9eccc16ee6720340d853db686)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>This project is possible thanks to the City Artist Corps grant.&nbsp; This award was created to energize New York City&#039;s artists and engage the public with arts activities this Summer and Fall.</em></span>
