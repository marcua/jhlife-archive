					Update on this: The tall skinny white dude is active again. We haven&#039;t seen him for a while but he&#039;s reappeared in the past few weeks. He seems to have changed his hours of business to evening hours between 6:00PM and 11:00PM. The past three days he was wearing a banana yellow sweat suit. Tonight, a white one. He also doesn&#039;t seem to care about social distancing since he gets pretty close with his clients. Maybe that will be his downfall since the 115th, and Moya, don&#039;t seem to really care. He definitely lives on 86th between Roosevelt and 37th.

					Red scooter guy (AKA red jacket guy, AKA puffy yellow jacket guy) has been quite active this evening. This is such an easy case for the 115th that it&#039;s absolutely ludicrous that they are taking absolutely no action. They could post it on twitter, facebook, etc. as proof that they are fighting crime.<br /><br />Our guess is that Moya and Dromm are not addressing these issues is because it would prove inconvenient for them to do so. Both would rather cut ribbons, or turn up at senior centers. That is their good deed for the neighborhood. Dromm&#039;s office at least responded to emails from our board and residents. It to perhaps eight emails from the board and residents to Moya&#039;s office to get a stock, boiler plate response telling us to contact our NCOs, who have already told us that they can&#039;t do much.<br /><br />We don&#039;t believe it is wise to disclose, on a public forum, which businesses might be involved with this for a variety of reasons. However, if you look at the photos on the first page of this thread and pay attention to what is happening on the street, it is pretty easy to figure it out what is going on and where. This again brings up the question of why the 115th is incapable of doing something about it.

					An update: We have been trying to collect videos (as opposed to just still photos) of deals going down to send to the NCOs for Sector C and the 115th. We feel that it would be better to bombard them with a bunch of evidence at one time as opposed to sending emails once a week. <br /><br />The new development is that someone from a business along 37th has become increasingly involved, to the extent that one of the people in the photos above may be employed with one to make &quot;deliveries&quot; for them. This is unfortunate because it is a well liked business. It is quite possible that the owner does not know that this is happening since they are not often on site and have put someone else in charge of making hires for low level positions.<br /><br />One of the people in the photos above was spotted today around 6:00, on a red scooter and speaking with someone wearing a fluorescent yellow ski mask on 37th near 86th. This seems like a bad omen.<br /><br />The 115th, Francisco Moya, and Daniel Dromm seem to be unwilling to take this issue, as well as the issue at 79th and Roosevelt seriously. Part of the problem might be that the 115th is simply too large to police effectively given the problems that are present. Still, it should be fairly easy to solve the problem of the dealers and what is going on on 79th and Roosevelt because it is so out in the open. Just stick a plain clothes cop in an unmarked car in either location for 24 hours and arrests could be made.<br /><br />A protest is a good idea, but it would probably better for us to show up en masse at the 115th Precinct with media in tow. Protesting the actual sites of the offenses would probably be ineffective and could put people in danger. We aren&#039;t exactly dealing with people who are inclined to see the error of their ways, and they most likely abide by a different moral code than those of us who have a certain amount of respect for the community.

					It is amazing that problems that are so out in the open and obvious continue to persist. Maybe it&#039;s time to get a couple of hundred people together and occupy the 115th&#039;s precinct office. The 115th seems to cover too large of an area to police effectively (it really should be divided into two or three additional precincts), but the situation at 79th and the one in the 80s is so obvious that there really is no excuse for these activities to continue for so long.

					An update on this: We&#039;re sorry to report that the situation has become worse over the past few months. NCOs Liebold and Scala with the 115th, while responsive, have basically told us that there is not much that they can do (they say they are spread too thin). Francisco Moya&#039;s office has not responded to AT ALL to numerous emails from the board or residents (we will remember this when he is up for re-election). Trips in person to the the 115th have proved to be absolutely useless.<br /><br />In the meantime, the dealers have been encroaching on our co-op, sometimes sitting on our stoops, approaching residents and trying to sell to them, and doing business with employees at businesses along 37th Ave. They have been involved in at least two fights on 37th Ave in the past month (possible turf war?) and one of them is likely responsible for the robbery of the bodega referenced here: <a href="https://jacksonheightspost.com/man-steals-1400-in-jackson-heights-armed-robbery" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://jacksonheightspost.com/man-steals-1400-in-jackson-heights-armed-robbery</a><br /><br />The Pollyannas on this board can complain all they want about posting photos, but our residents have been dealing with this day in and day out. The 115th and our elected officials do nothing.

					Does anyone know what happened on 85th between 37th and Roosevelt yesterday around 10:30 or 11:00AM? There were a bunch of cops, the block seemed to be closed off, and there was an SUV near the corner of 37th that had the passenger side window busted out.

There is also a pattern in how they work, which is also best not described here. I will say that none of the people concerned appear to be particularly smart and that is what concerns us most.

					@abcdefghijk Your ideas are all fun and would be worth a try, but JKResident makes a good point. Many of the residents who spend a lot of time outside, and who have witnessed what has been happening, are elderly. We wouldn&#039;t want to open them up to retaliation by these idiots.<br /><br />If the 115th would be willing to contact one of the board members who have sent emails to our NCOs, or contact the people who complained at the precinct, we would gladly let them review the footage from our security cameras, which would provide ample evidence of what has been going on. The best that they have done is assure us that they will send more patrol cars down our block. This issue could be solved in a day with three undercover officers stationed strategically.<br /><br />We have contacted both the offices of Daniel Dromm and Francisco Moya over the past few months. The response has been underwhelming.<br /><br />To those who are accusing us of simply taking photos of random people, what you are missing (perhaps because you didn&#039;t read the previous posts), is that this has been going on for months. All of the photos that were posted were pulled from our security cameras on different days, and one shows a deal happening. Also, with the exception of two, each photo shows the same person. When it happens almost every day, it&#039;s pretty easy to see what is going on especially when no effort is made to hide it.

We don&#039;t really care what people do in their own private spaces, but we don&#039;t want it happening in front of our building, every day, for 4 months now. Nor are we interested in the additional problems that often comes with such activity. This is not an unreasonable position.

					Ok, one more of the person who may be the supplier. He always wears a hoodie and sun glasses. He tends to avoid looking at buildings where cameras may be and seems to have surveyed the area for security cameras. The photo is lousy but hopefully someone will recognize him.
