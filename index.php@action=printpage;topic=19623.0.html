				Hi all! I am wondering if anyone has really strong recommendations for a local realtor.&nbsp; I am moving to Nevada and would appreciate any leads (especially if they were strong communicators while you were in a transition or not in the area!)&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks and Happy New Year!<br />Julia

				Salim and Ambreen Faruqi handled my apartment sale, they were smart, had good suggestions about presentation, vetted folks (open house by appointment) showed the apartment while I was out of town, accepted the best offer I got, was well within the ballpark of what I was looking to get (I thought we had priced a little optimistically at first), helped with follow through, was happy with the RE lawyer they suggested and gave them limited PoA to handle the closing after I left NYC. Highly recommended.<br />
