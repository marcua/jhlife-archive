				Few days a ago I was in Brooklyn Williamsburg and I was shocked to see the neighbor changed in couple of years..I wish which we can change J.hts to more classy, clean and little uniform and we should try to attract tourist to stop by J.hts.&nbsp; The area around the train station looks so disgusting and dirty. We need artist and smart people who can changes some of the areas in J.heights. Any suggestions??????

				I&#039;m all for clean but I&#039;m vehemently against uniformity.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like the gritty hodgepodge that makes JH so full of character and unique, why not move?<br /><br />I first found JH as a tourist looking for saris and indian sweets.&nbsp; I like how unique and how unlike manhattan and park slope it is... it still has a soul.

				i agree with mary poppins...williamsburg is only attractive, in my opinion, to single people in their twenties. not that there&#039;s anything wrong with that group, but not many of them are in the market for historic district co-ops.<br /><br />the reason williamsburg was so easy to gentrify is that landlords were easily able to get rid of tenants with no standing, both commercial and residential. it&#039;s harder to force someone to leave an apartment if they own it.

				Maybe if an appealing restaurant (at the very least a brick oven pizza place or a better Italian place other than our single underwhelming, overpriced option, Armando&#039;s) or a craft brewery, for instance, (not drug lord-owned or on Roosevelt Ave.), or some other interesting option would open up here and then get favorably reviewed, it might attract notice and raise the desirability factor of the neighborhood.<br /><br />Since the above idealized sequence of events seems to work in a chain reaction, other interesting (artisan or craft) businesses might become attracted to our area as a result of the favorable review. This is probably wishful thinking, but it seems as though that&#039;s how revitalization has happened elsewhere. In Brooklyn, anyway. JH is home to lots of creative and smart people. Except that we&#039;re all locked in our apartments because there&#039;s nowhere interesting we can walk to and socially mix. <br /><br />The way I feel, if I have to get on a train, I may as well go into Manhattan. Lots of times I just don&#039;t feel like taking the subway, especially when it&#039;s freezing outside. It&#039;s like going to work.

				&nbsp; I haven&#039;t lived in JH very long but I believe it has it&#039;s own charm.&nbsp; It may not be trendy or super classy however it is pretty interesting.&nbsp; Personally I appreciate that the neighborhood isn&#039;t really trendy and expensive.&nbsp; The variety of cultures and food we have here are pretty great too.<br />&nbsp; That being said, I wouldn&#039;t mind having a couple more options for some social interaction.&nbsp; Though, because I&#039;m new here I might not be aware of most places people hang out here.&nbsp; I have no interest in singles clubs or things like that, but I like to meet new people and socialize.&nbsp; Especially since I don&#039;t know many people in the city.<br />&nbsp; If it&#039;s the arts and socializing we&#039;re missing though, we could organize some local art events I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; Again, there are probably things like this going on that I don&#039;t know about.&nbsp; We have a nice forum here for getting the word out though.&nbsp; I would certainly be into meeting local artists and seeing their work.&nbsp; :)

				I most certainly don&#039;t want another Williamsburg but that doesn&#039;t mean we couldn&#039;t use a nice Irish pub, brewery, or even a damn decent gym or park.&nbsp; Goodness knows the market is there.&nbsp; And we have the best transportation and green market around.&nbsp; And the best damn residences.&nbsp; A brewery or gym opening up here would probably make a killing.&nbsp; A girl can dream.&nbsp; I agree completely with Fizzster.&nbsp; There is a middle ground here that can be had.

				If you&#039;ve been reading this forum since the beginning, you will know that this topic comes up with great regularity. A different topic title, but same stuff.<br /><br />JH is what it is. The changes will come gradually. <br /><br />If anyone knows some investors who want to open a pub, restaurant, bookstore, wine bar, gym, social meeting center - and I almost forgot - movie theater, then bring them over to check out JH. If you know someone like Julie and Afzal of E77, have them talk to them. Their fine place was ground-breaking. Table Wine &amp; Inner Peace were also examples of enterprising individuals who took a chance on 11372.<br /><br />But don&#039;t bitch about what we don&#039;t have, thanks, but we&#039;ve all heard it before.

				For years now, there have been periodic attempts by local realtors and others to market JH as the next Park Slope, Carroll Gardens etc. -- but people who move here thinking the neighborhood is on the cusp of some transformative change will inevitably be disappointed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I moved to JH in early 1999.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the prices of coops have risen exponentially since then, there has been relatively little change in the business mix in all these years.&nbsp; So I am a little skeptical that things are likely to change all that much in the forseeable future either.&nbsp; <br /><br />In a way, it is easy to see why there has not been greater change.&nbsp; Unlike some other areas, it seems to me there is no real need for a revitalization of JH -- the neighborhood is already quite vital and successful in its own right.&nbsp; In most important ways (with a few exceptions) , JH serves its residents very well in terms of the quality and availability of basic goods and services such as groceries, pharmacies, doctors, dentists, banks, dry cleaners, hardware stores, restaurants, bars etc.&nbsp; Most of these businesses seem to do a roaring trade and are unlikely to give way to boutiques or craft shops any time soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For me that is not really a problem -- I still find JH to be a uniquely interesting and alluring neighborhood in an increasingly homogenized city.&nbsp; (Not trying to score a political point, just a matter of personal taste/aesthetics.)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				The problem is, most folks want the neighborhood to maintain its unique charm, which usually translates to &quot;what it was like 5 minutes before I moved here&quot;. Unfortunately, those &quot;5 minutes&quot; are sometimes separated by as much as 50 years, so even the &quot;unique charm of the neighborhood&quot; is different things to different people. Sunnyside has managed to have an abundance of bars, healthy restaurants, diverse cuisine, small shops etc. without the (apparently horrific) onslaught of &quot;hipsters&quot; or becoming another colony of Imperialist Brooklyn. <br />And yes, we are quite well served by banks and pharmacies. I can&#039;t spit in any direction without hitting one....

				I looked at eleven apartments in Sunnyside for the reasons you mentioned, but they were all kind of dumpy. Nothing real bad, just not as nice as what I got in JH. I for one am really glad that Legends Bar exists, it&#039;s one of the few bars that has an okay tap selection and clientele I can have a conversation with. I haven&#039;t been to Espresso 77 yet because it&#039;s so tiny and packed.

				I know in my heart of hearts that if anyone in this neighborhood were to ever take a leap of faith and save years of their wages to open up a Brooklyn-y brunchy bar place that it would be a MASSIVE success. &nbsp;There is clearly a market for it from counting the number of translucent Ray Bans and slim-fitting Patagonias at the farmer&#039;s market (mmhmm, I see you &nbsp;:-*). The issue is no one has done it. &nbsp;So, we can complain about the rando 99 cent stores all we want but fair and square, whoever opened it gathered the 6-figure capital necessary to do so. &nbsp;And unlike the small businesses in of the early 2000&#039;s in neighborhoods like Greenpoint and Williamsburg or even Crown Heights more recently, investing in Jackson Heights requires exactly that: an investment. &nbsp;I know a number of successful designers who now own storefronts in Nolita that started out in Williamsburg 10 years ago, and they were able to open that cute jewelry shop/coffee shop/craft beer bar because rents cost practically nothing there. &nbsp;This is simply not true in Jackson Heights. I think a lot of people get confused by the immigrant mentality about $. It is inconceivable for immigrants to think of paying for $3 for a soda while eating out but they do not blink an eye when handing a relative $80,000 in cash to help them with a new business. &nbsp;(Basically, this is how my parents operate.) Similarly, Jackson Heights may look &#039;poor&#039; to the outsider but the rents don&#039;t necessarily reflect what one would expect of similarly &#039;un-gentrified&#039; neighborhoods. Your average immigrant granny has like $50k in benjamins rolled up in her mattress somewhere. <br /><br />While I think Williamsburg peaked in 2007 and is about as exciting as a midwestern college town now, there isn&#039;t a single day that I don&#039;t wish that I could go home and not either stumble onto some weird drug bust/chase down Roosevelt, an illegal furniture sale, abandoned car sales, step on gum/spit, etc. &nbsp;I really do think it&#039;s wonderful that in 2012 that our neighborhood remains a place in NYC where you can live like a person on a real person budget instead of a trust fund brat. &nbsp;Regardless of how you feel about willing its &#039;artsiness&#039; and &#039;trendiness&#039; further, I think the first step that everyone can agree on would be to see the quality of life issues dealt with - cleaner streets, less honking, less illegal activity, etc. &nbsp;We will all be better off for it. Then maybe, someone will front the cash for a bistro and &#039;trendy&#039; places!<br /><br />

				agreed, daisy, cleaner streets and less illegal activity are great things-- and our neighborhood has made great strides in both, as anyone who&#039;s lived here for any length of time can attest. not that we&#039;ve achieved perfect scores, but it&#039;s a whole lot better than my first experiences around here in &#039;82 or so.<br /><br />and williamsburg? far, far, far dirtier than jackson heights as a rule, particularly when it comes to the public urination that my friends who live there say the patrons of those cool bars are responsible for. ditto the coke dealing, which is about the same there. yeah, i recognize i am honing in on that one neighborhood, but it seems to be the point of comparison for so many people seeking a new york ideal before moving to rockland county.

				Seriously without making Jackson Heights another Williamsburg or Park Slope, this place could use some sprucing up. In your house or apartment, you need to paint, replace things, update things. Why is JH any different? Let&#039;s face it, there are merchants who&#039;s stores are just plain trashy and then there are some that really try to make this place a pleasant place to live. In my opinion, there are too many who either don&#039;t try or don&#039;t care. Can I make them do things differently to my tastes? Obviously not. But if a merchant have a crummy plastic sign hanging from the front of your store or a bunch or trashy merchandise on a table out front, I hope they get a ticket for not adhering to landmark (or other) laws. By not following the rules, everyone suffers, people don&#039;t want to shop here, people don&#039;t want to live here. And I don&#039;t mean just &quot;hipsters&quot;. I mean normal middle class people who want to run out on the weekend and shop in their OWN neighborhood, not have to go to Manhattan or Trader Joe&#039;s in Forest Hills. I work long hours and want to buy local, but sorry, this place really could use some help. Should I move, well I would, if I could. I&#039;d rather stay, cause this place has a lot of potential, if only it wasn&#039;t it&#039;s own worse enemy.&nbsp; I was thrilled to see that 82nd BID is going to start working with merchants, thrillled!!!

				i agree that there are some retailers who have little or no consideration for making their storefronts look even remotely nice, and i wish they would put in more of an effort.<br /><br />but in any neighborhood where there&#039;s economic diversity, there&#039;s diversity of retail. some people like 99 cent stores. some people NEED 99 cent stores. i actually find myself getting some great bargains in our dollar stores -- but if i had my way, i&#039;d cut back on phone card places and check cashing joints -- both of which clearly also cater to a demand (if they didn&#039;t, they wouldn&#039;t exist).<br /><br />it&#039;s safe to say that roosevelt avenue, like brighton beach avenue or other places where an el is overhead, is not going to spruce up. it&#039;s a fact of life. if a couple of people took a chance on 37th avenue or even woodside avenue, i think they might be pleasantly surprised about the response.<br /><br />we have destination places here. friends of mine asked to be taken to our south asian restaurants back in the &#039;90s. or to d&#039;espana, or to....well, you get the idea. we don&#039;t need a complete change of vibe, just a few people to actually make little tweaks, rather than root them on from the sidelines.

				I live here - that was good suggestion- ...I find the produce in the supermarket to be lacking freshness.Most time I travel to the city. I wish we can have a nice place for grocery shopping. By the way, I was walking down 74 street today I was disappointed by the renovation of the old Jackson Height movie theater.&nbsp; I wish they would have kept some kind of old character to the building , I wish someone can cleanup that area and the new grocery store next to Citibank looks so nasty and dirty.

				Last night I stopped at the Met food store because I find it&#039;s the best for the most things. well I was shocked to see it lit up outside like a nightclub (it&#039;s a food store!!!), the produce wilted and the cashiers milling around like there weren&#039;t any customers on line. I live down the other end of 37th but I would walk down to the Met because Trade Fair on 90th has been even worse. I&#039;ve been working alot and away for the holidays so I haven&#039;t seen the new lighting set-up. I was shocked that after all those months of work on the exterior, it looks like a Gentleman&#039;s Club. I&#039;m sorry, it&#039;s simply horrible. Others may disagree, that&#039;s your perrogative, but I was really disappointed.

				BUT if you can make it there on Sundays - the JH Farmers Market is one of the best neighborhood markets in the city and a great way to shop local. I go as often as I can. Even if you can&#039;t find kiwis, it&#039;s healthier to eat locally produced seasonal food.

				i agree completely about the &quot;renovation&quot; .... i don&#039;t know what they were thinking.<br /><br />but don&#039;t judge the merchandise quality by a sunday night visit -- that&#039;s the worst time to look for produce or meat, since you&#039;re guaranteed everything that&#039;s out is at least a couple of days old. the produce is actually pretty good there as a rule, although i wish they hadn&#039;t pulled back on organic offerings. trade fair still has a decent selection on that front.

				&nbsp;The success of the Farmers Market makes a point that there should be &quot;comparable&quot; businesses all over Jackson Heights<br />as we clearly have the demographic who likes quality food. Could the landlords on 37th avenue really hold this much<br />power as to deter wanted businesses from trying to open here? Because Astoria and Sunnyside don&#039;t seem to have this<br />problem with inviting a fresher retail environment.

				I would definitely love to see a good brunch spot or two or decent pub with a great beer selection. There&#039;s tons of stuff in Astoria though which is a quick skip over the R. There&#039;s some good trendish stuff in the hood to mix with the great diversity we have here. E77, Table Wine,&nbsp; and a couple others. I haven&#039;t been to Legends yet though I&#039;ve been trying to get over there, do they have TVs? Maybe I could catch some playoffs there over the weekend if so.<br /><br />The place that confounds me to no end is Novo. It&#039;s got a good vibe and a decent menu during the day/early evening. But it turns into a total cr*pshow later at night to the point where guns are being pulled and they need bouncers. Saddening. One of these days something like happened the other day where a lady that got hit in the gut by a stray bullet while sitting in her apt is going to happen.

				@I live here too - The often lauded Lemon Farm, on 77 and 37, has good groceries and there&#039;s a great store for vegetables next door when you can&#039;t get to the farmer&#039;s market. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s called but I think it&#039;s Korean-owned, there are usually some fruits outside and it doesn&#039;t look really worthy of exploring but once you go inside you&#039;ll find some nice, fresh, <span class="bbc_u">CLEAN</span> produce that is neatly and nicely laid out. (Everyone know the place I&#039;m talking about?) &nbsp;The prices are fair too. &nbsp;Cleanliness is a BIG thing for me because I&#039;ve found that pretty much all the leafy produce I buy from Trade Fair, or even occasionally the Met, have tons of debris on it. &nbsp;I think the Met is overall fine, if not a little generic and boring (and now with the horrible Florida strip mall lights), but I have a special place in my heart for Trade Fair. &nbsp;My boyfriend calls it &quot;sh*tshow&quot; and refuses to refer to it by name. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think that place is great for actual grocery shopping but it&#039;s great as like, an anthropological field trip. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know how a grocery store can manage to simultaneously be too much and too little, but it totally is. &nbsp;<br /><br />My big gripe grocery wise about JH is the lack of quality meat -- fish markets and butchers in a central location. &nbsp;Yes, I know that I can probably source things from different places but it&#039;s not that easy especially since those places cater to ethnic populations and as an English speaker I can&#039;t navigate them that well. &nbsp;I grew up in Astoria and I miss having butchers and fish people who I know by name who save me the cuts I like!<br />

				Yes, I know about those stores but I live down the other end of 37th (on 88th). We were excited when a fruit/vegetable store opened&nbsp; on 85th, it looked promising but the produce is lackluster. My husband likes fruit and proclaimed his purchases tasteless. Lemon Tree is clearly a much better store in terms of quality and &quot;aesthetics&quot;. The store started out neat and orderly, then the &quot;How many signs/lights etc. can I hang in my window&quot; effect began. I don&#039;t know why merchants think that flashing lights, music and other distractions are going to add up to sales around here, because clearly they do not. When the sign for 40 Ounce Malt Liquor went up, it was all over for me. I know that the store is just trying to make a living, I know.<br /><br />On the other hand, most people don&#039;t realize this but the restaurant El Chivito D&#039;oro sells fresh uncooked meat in a case at the front of the restaurant.&nbsp; I really like this restaurant in general, it is authentic without being garish and ugly. The steak sandwiches are a great deal. I haven&#039;t bought a fresh steak from them yet, but they look to be of good quality, much like the Argentinian butcher that closed.

				I have not tried the boina roja butcher shop but it looks like a nice shop. there is a hispanic butcher up by me on 37th by Trade Fair, but it is mob scene at all times and the few times I walked in there, I was bowled over by a unpleasant smell. Yes, I do miss the Argentinian butcher. I think chivito del oro has a relationship with them though.

				Mi Tierra on Northern and 82nd is small but clean and well organized with very good fruits and vegetables (although a limited selection of other goods).&nbsp; I find this to be a very pleasant place to shop.<br /><br />A few blocks further along is what is now called&nbsp; Compare which has been through several previous incarnations but is currently a large and reasonably well-stocked store, with decent fruits and vegetables and has the added advantage of being open 24 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Both of these are just a few blocks away from where I live so I canâ€™t complain.&nbsp; Also in that general area along Northern in the 80s are, among other things, Pan Fino (open 24 hours) two&nbsp; good dry cleaners, a good bagel place, Pio Pio eat in and take out, two empanada places, a decent hardware store, Dâ€™Espana, and a 24 hour Rite Aid.&nbsp; Re the latter, I know that some people on this board have a horror of proliferating drug stores (which I understand up to a point) but for me it is a huge convenience having something so basic that is always open just a couple of blocks from my apartmentâ€¦â€¦ <br /><br />On a less positive note, I have to say that C Town on 37th and 85th , which was a dreary place when I moved here, only seems to have gotten worse with the passing years but I just try to avoid itâ€¦..<br />

				I&#039;m South american and I&#039;m proud that Jackson Heights is NOT trendy, classy and attractive..if we start to see changes like Williamsburg then the real estate price will go up . I&#039;m glad&nbsp; lot of people in this blog don&#039;t want to make like Williamsburg. I&#039;m happy that we can shop in a store like Bangladesh 99 cents stores and I love shopping at 82 street and Roosevelt ave. I&#039;m glad the subway station at 74 street looks ugly design, dark dirty station iIF they renovate then MTA will increase the subway fare.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad that our community is NOT complaining&nbsp; about the station and its atmosphere... I glad To live in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Cheap food at 73 Bengali bazaar, best 99 cent stores in NYC, great Asian bodegas corner stores at 37 ave.&nbsp; WE HAVE CHEAP RENT AND CHEAP FOOD. CAN&#039;T GO WRONG WITH THAT !!! One of the best place to live in queens.

				It is possible to live in an affordable place and not have it look like a dump. Immigrants have done this for as long as there have been immigrants.&nbsp; Also, Jackson Heights residents are not only South American, but they are middle class working people who aspire to more, if only a livable environment to live and raise families in.

				I&#039;m on board with those yearning for improved quality of life. &nbsp;Some parts of J.Heights are just beautiful and a big part of what sucked me in 5 years ago when I moved here. &nbsp;But other parts are often so dirty and unpleasant - namely the areas closer to the subway. &nbsp;That dumpster on the west side of 75th between Roosevelt and 37th avenue that is right on the walk to the subway and out most mornings is perhaps the worst consistently bad smelling thing (during the summer) I&#039;ve ever encountered. &nbsp;My wife and I love taking long walks around the neighborhood, but rarely do we venture south of 35th avenue and we increasingly walk north of Northern for variety (though 34th avenue in the 70&#039;s &amp; 80&#039;s is still my favorite including some of the adjoining blocks). &nbsp;I&#039;ve lived in Hell&#039;s Kitchen, Manhattan&#039;s Chinatown, the East Village, and Williamsburg - and I don&#039;t mind gritty as an interesting change of pace, but our neighborhood just has the wrong kind of &#039;grit&#039; for me I guess.<br /><br />With regards to comparisons to Williamsburg or Astoria, Jackson Heights may be missing some of the cool restaurants and outdoor cafes, but the architecture in Jackson Heights (north of 37th Avenue at least) is so much nicer. &nbsp;Williamsburg to me was one of the ugliest places I&#039;ve ever lived. &nbsp;I work in Manhattan so I can get my fix of trendy shops and restaurants there (not that I&#039;d mind a few more here). &nbsp;I&#039;d just rather my neighborhood at home be a little cleaner. &nbsp;I mean, littering is against the law, right?

				<br />I agree that the most important and realistic thing to focus on would be to clean up the neighborhood. It needs it.<br /><br />I have no illusions about this neighborhood, it is an affordable and safe lower middle class family neighborhood, good public transit, with a strong immigrant community. Other than some of the gorgeous architecture, the only outstanding feature I believe is the incredible/authentic ethnic food. To partake in anything very interesting, or entertainment related I always need to leave the neighborhood, it&#039;s a fact.<br /><br />Let us not forget the H- word.<br />The people responsible for changing certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn you have been discussing, are Hipsters.<br />The truth is, young, single, artistic types do not flock and or strive to live in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Hipsters transformed Williamsburg, I believe, because they were incredibly passsionate about the neighborhood, and only with great passion, can residents transform a neighborhood.<br />Just look at how Bushwick has started to evolve, do you know why? The middle class Hipsters who could no longer afford Williamsburg moved there, again , there&#039;s something about Brooklyn that drives young people to transform it, make it their own.<br /><br />Take Care.

				Fearing (or hoping) that JH will become another Williamsburg or Park Slope is silly. The design of the neighborhood alone precludes any move in those directions. We have no park space, limited building development potential, and strict boundaries between residential and commercial properties. I can only assume that the planning of Jackson Heights (unlike the more organic growth of older neighborhoods like Astoria) makes it very difficult to open a commercial venture that doesn&#039;t target the broadest possible audience. There&#039;s little room to open &quot;off the beaten path,&quot; to take a chance on a quiet and less expensive corner. Sooner or later &quot;trendy&quot; and &quot;classy&quot; bars and restaurants will creep in, perhaps even on prime corners, but I think JH lacks the structural requisites to bring about wholesale gentrification.

				But aspiring to keep JH dirty noisy and with substandard retail (yes nothing other than 99 cent stores and bodegas is substandard) is no aspiration at all. We need clean streets, fresh quality food and stores that sell products that don&#039;t leach toxicity into the environment. This should be a baseline for a middle class neighborhood.

Basically the same as saying that Honey Boo Boo&#039;s family is that way because they&#039;re white. &nbsp;Even ethnic communities know of Jackson Heights as a bit slummy and those who reside there know that the conditions of the street are unacceptable. &nbsp;And all it boils down to a lack of civic pride and belief that the neighborhood could be a community rather than a place to do business or crash temporarily. And unfortunately street cleanliness is one of those awful behavioral feedback-loop causing type situations where people litter because they think it&#039;s dirty, and it&#039;s dirty because they keep littering. &nbsp;Do you really think those THREE people I saw spitting ON the train platform this morning would ever dare to do it on a Upper East Side street? No. And most immigrants have SPARKLING houses with floors cleaned nightly and a higher standard of personal hygiene that the majority of Americans - the issue all boils down to the lack of civic feeling for the public of JH. &nbsp;There are PLENTY of ethnic communities in NYC-area that do not have the same level of grit - neighborhoods such as Sunset Park, Sunnyside, Lefferts Gardens, Ditmas Park, Bayside (I find comparisons to Roosevelt to under the El in Astoria laughable, nowhere in Astoria is there more gum than sidewalk on the street.) &nbsp;I think it says a lot that ALL of the small business owners in J Heights that I&#039;ve spoken to do not even live in the neighborhood - they live in Astoria or Bayside or Sunnyside. <br /><br />Anyway, at the end of the day, all I really want is for people to simply obey the law and have some sense of pride in the neighborhood. &nbsp;Meaning no illegally zoned businesses. &nbsp; More regulation of law-breaking medical establishments that target a poor and illegal population while scamming medicare/medicaid - I&#039;m looking at you, gross 75th street doctors. No street taco vendors pouring 2 gallons worth of HOT GREASE onto the streets (saw this this weekend!). No crazy obviously illegal office furniture sales. &nbsp;Even something as simple as repaving the streets by the 74 train station would go a long way because it would dramatically make a difference in the level of expectation so that the first thing people see isn&#039;t a street peppered completely with gum and pigeon crap.

				<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">While there is limited growth due to JH specific design, there is plenty of potential for new pubs, artist and eateries.&nbsp; The one issue I see is that once you have a historical designation it is almost impossible to change the overall character of a neighborhood.&nbsp; I think Jackson Hts is unique and charming and it will never be a Williamsburg because a real community existed here long before Williamsburg was largely rezoned in 2005.&nbsp; Since the 1990&#039;s, there was an effort to save Williamsburg and rightly so.&nbsp; It was a horrible place, not unlike the South Bronx, Harlem and many other Brooklyn spots of the &quot;not so long ago&quot;.&nbsp; When New York City Council approved and passed the huge rezoning of the North and Greenpoint&#039;s waterfront it was with the intent to gentrify and the landlords moved to take advantage of the Real Estate boom.&nbsp; LIC is going through this as well and just wait and see what happens within the next 4 or 5 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing that perplexes me is the huge rents that Jackson Hts store fronts command for the relatively small sq footage..&nbsp; Even in places like Astoria, LIC and Williamsburg the square ft prices tend to be more comparably reasonable.&nbsp; I know of some landlords that actually try to help the new business get established if they bring something special to their building.&nbsp; I have never seen that in Jackson Hts and surrounding area.</span>

				I do understand the low commercial rents in LIC. JH is a great community, and the residents actually walk around and shop locally. LIC is largely a commuter community. I spend a lot of time there, and I get frustrated b/c there are sooo many people that live in those huge apartment buildings, and yet their beautiful new park is largely empty - except of nannys - and the restaurants are dead. friday and saturday nights it might seem like a hotspot, but at other times everyone is in another borough. This figures, for a place where the biggest asset to a community is the ability to leave it. <br /><br />HOWEVER, it is absurd that the rents are so high, and 37th avenue is visibly dying. Roosevelt Avenue, on the other hand, at least does not have lifeless storefronts for very long.

				Regardless of co-op rules if the legal resident of the home is not home during the stay, it is illegal and you run the risk of NYC authorities cracking down on you. So it doesn&#039;t matter co-op/condo/private house. <br /><br />The last thing NYC wants is for landlords of residential homes to skirt rental laws and get in under the radar on our hotel industry.<br /><br />Hotels/Hostals/B&amp;Bs exist for a reason, so do residential homes.&nbsp; Its a huge risk to confuse the two.&nbsp;

				As has been pointed out on this thread and in others, the commercial rents in Jackson Heights, particularly on 37th Ave, are way too high.&nbsp; This may be the single biggest factor preventing small, locally owned businesses from starting up.&nbsp; <br /><br />The real estate is privately owned and the owners have the right to charge (or try to charge) whatever the market will bear.&nbsp; Having said that, there has to be some creative solutions we could explore as a community to work with landlords to encourage a better mix of retail on 37th.<br /><br />I don&#039;t pretend to have the answers, but I wish there were a way to start that dialogue.&nbsp; Who can provide leadership?&nbsp; Council Member Dromm?&nbsp; <br /><br />I love that we have this forum on the web to discuss it, but how can we get the ball rolling in the &quot;real world&quot;?

				&nbsp;I think that renting in your own home/apt should be allowed as long as someone responsible is there. In Ireland, for example<br />many women run a small business renting rooms in their homes, B&amp;B style, and it&#039;s government supervised. They are clean <br />and affordable and have to pass a government inspection that might be yearly with advice on costs and upgrades.<br />&nbsp; It&#039;s a great way to travel and feel like you are seeing some measure of authenticity in the place. This Jackson Heights rental<br />looks great to me and far better than some new but sterile hotel in LIC for visiting NYC.

				I discussed that with the Skift guy. It should read &quot;almost all.&quot; The number of one and two family homes being rented out on AirBNB is tiny. Not zero, but tiny compared to the thousands of illegal apartments. As far as I&#039;ve read the law, a building has to be a multiple dwelling for the law to apply here.

				I actually think the station is pretty nice too. &nbsp;But recently, I tried to use one of the machines to purchase an unlimited with a credit card and absolutely none of them worked and the station attendant said it had been that way for months. &nbsp;Not sure if it&#039;s fixed by now. &nbsp;I&#039;d get rid of the pigeon crap all over the outside - but that&#039;s a huge undertaking since the nests are all along the elevated train. &nbsp;One spot I think they should really clean up is the entrance near the pedestrian plaza. &nbsp;It&#039;s constantly littered with garbage and the homeless use it as a hangout as well. &nbsp;It&#039;s pretty gross most of the time.<br /><br />The actual station inside is pretty nice though. &nbsp;And I do like Backwoods.

				JHBG -- Jackson Heights Beautification Group has been working for the last 25 years to make JH a better, safer and cleaner place to live. <br /><br />JHBG now takes care of&nbsp; 4 public garden spaces in JH (in front of the JH Post Office, 37th Ave at the BQE, along the east side of the BQE and 34th Ave and Junction Blvd), we plant flowers in the tree pits along 37th Avenue each spring.&nbsp; This fall JHBG planted thousands of daffodil bulbs along 34th Avenue, in the school yards on 34th Avenue and along the eastside of the BQE.&nbsp; A group of volunteers works to keep our street trees healthy, by removing bricks, adding mulch and pruning. JHBG just opened a new composting center this fall and collects on the weekends at the 78th Street Play Street. (JH SCRAPS)<br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG established a large and small dog run at the BQE at 35th Avenue. (JH CREW).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG removes graffiti all around Jackson Heights.<br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG normally holds an annual&nbsp; Halloween parade if there are no super storms to interfere. <br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG helps run the 78th Street Play Street with JH Green Alliance bring the Police Athletic League, PAL, last summer and the Summer Sunday Concerts for the last 10 years. <br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG does an annual tree lighting at the Post Office where children sing and the tree is lighted.<br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG co-hosts Principal&#039;s night at 82nd Street Academics every January to help parents understand the public school options in the area.<br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG hosts Community forums when issues arise such as to start the Play Street and to insist that the city buy the lot from Garden school to expand Travers Park. <br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG has a group that work with the parks department to improve Travers Park.<br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG advocates for the community about how the neighborhood looks.&nbsp; JHBG established and are pushing to expand the JH Historic District.&nbsp; JHBG files complaints with the building department about sign violations.&nbsp; After the fire along 37th Avenue, JHBG attending all the meetings regarding the planning of the new apartment building and made written submission seeking changes that were granted.<br />&nbsp;<br />Each spring, JHBG runs&nbsp; an annual JH Historic Tour and lectures about the history of Jackson Heights. <br />&nbsp;<br />JHBG has launched the Jackson Heights Orchestra --which will have 2 upcoming Spring concerts. <br />&nbsp;<br />We run a web site full of community information.&nbsp; We publish a newsletter full of community information. <br />&nbsp;<br />We attend public meetings about school re-zoning, transportation changes and city planning to watch out for the interests of Jackson Heights. <br />I am not saying JHBG is perfect, but we are active.&nbsp; What I think JHBG does best is offer guidance, support and financial backing to individuals in the community who want to start a community project.&nbsp; So we have a group of people who love to gardens, love dogs, love compost, love classical music and JHBG helps them turn their dreams of a better neighborhood into reality.<br />We have no paid staff. We are all volunteer organization.&nbsp; We would love to have more people volunteer and to support new projects.&nbsp; We are a dynamic organization that changes as Jackson Heights changes, which is why I was upset at the post below.<br /><br />Check us out at www.JHBG.org<br /><br />Nuala

				One of my friend who owns successful bar in midtown Manhattan and another bar in Williamsburg....So I suggested him to expand his&nbsp; business to Jackson Heights. I was surprise that he took my suggestion very seriously and he did some feasibility study and after doing his study he found out that rents are too High on 37 ave ( vacant corner store on 76 street and 37 ave is going for almost $10,000 per month) and he found out that most of the middle class residence prefer to spend their social time in the city and they prefer to shop in the city.&nbsp; That means less volume and high rents.&nbsp;

				The whole equation doesn&#039;t make sense to me. &nbsp;Low volume (and low margin stores) should not equal high rents. &nbsp;I&#039;m not questioning your friend&#039;s research - I just don&#039;t understand how such a market is sustainable. &nbsp;If JH residential apartment rents were higher, people wouldn&#039;t rent the apartments and would live elsewhere in the city, creating vacancy and leading to lower residential rents.<br /><br />On the other hand, 37th avenue doesn&#039;t appear to be low volume to my untrained eye and perhaps the dollar stores have a higher profit margin than I might guess. &nbsp;I&#039;ve never taken an economics class, but there must be a demand for the rents to remain high and there must be potential profit - at least for some types of stores - for there to be demand.

				This is a rumor amongst business owners... I have heard the landlords in Jackson Heights are prepared to maintain empty unleased stores... rather than lower rents to attract a more diverse commercial mix.<br /><br />This is because landlords are able to show a loss on their taxes...for that amount of rent... when a store is vacant.<br />And wait...with a vacant store...even years... until a business can afford to pay the high rent. (Like banks... etc)<br /><br />It makes very little difference to landlords whether a store is leased or not...in Jackson Heights landlords own blocks of stores. &nbsp;The tax deductions make up for loss in rent from an empty store.<br /><br />Unfortunately...there appears to be a cartel of landlords in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />This is why the commercial mix in Jackson Heights is not dynamic... compared with commercially forward-thinking areas of New York. &nbsp; There is no other reason. &nbsp;The market and population for more varied businesses are here.<br /><br />So this is what Jackson Heights landlords are doing. <br /><br />Other than bringing this to the attention of the IRS...though I believe it&#039;s legal, but very un-community minded... ... does anyone have an idea what can be done...?<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hmmm.&nbsp; Thinking. <br /><br />One excellent success story in Jackson Heights...is the Farmer&#039;s Market on Sundays by Travis Park.<br /><br />In Union Square, Manhattan...the Farmers&#039; market operates 7 days a week.<br /><br />If they can do that in Union Square...then why not here? <br /><br />Perhaps we can instigate a 7 day a week Farmers&#039; Market in Jackson Heights?<br /><br />Now that would certainly create an alternate, diverse and more interesting permanent mix of shopping in the neighborhood.<br /><br />And bypass the uncommunity-minded landlord problem entirely<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Union Square is actually open four days a week, not seven.<br /><br />And it&#039;s at a spot with a HUGE amount of foot traffic and office space, which makes weekday use more feasible. not many people find themselves walking down 34th avenue at 11 AM on a Wednesday.<br /><br />I&#039;d agree that it would be worthwhile to look into expanding to Saturdays, too, but we&#039;d probably have to recruit different vendors, since they do tend to move around from market to market.

				Ideas are sparking today...<br /><br />Another idea would be to convert that vacant Mandy&#039;s on Northern Bld/78th Street into a space for an indoor Farmer&#039;s&nbsp; market etc...where all sorts of stalls could be set up...permanently...Artisanal/Food/Flea/Craft/Vintage/books/flowers... whatever.<br /><br />Then that place would serve as a magnet for Jackson Heights folks...once it&#039;s established...a bustling atmosphere marketplace...much like they have in Europe...or like the Essex Street markets on the Lower Eastside...<br /><br />Hey...that could be a viable business venture!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				that is an intriguing idea....while that&#039;s a big space that probably carries a hefty price tag, rents on northern are significantly cheaper than on 37th or roosevelt, and providing a certificate of occupancy would allow for it, it would be cool to have a variety of things under one roof. not sure if actual cooking could go on on the premises, but still....it&#039;s interesting.

It could provide an opportunity for people to start a business in the neighborhood at a lower cost and it could serve as an incubator. If they are successful in the shared space, they may eventually set out on their own elsewhere in the neighborhood. I&#039;m not sure how many stalls could be set up in this space, but I&#039;m sure if the rent were divided amongst them it would be more reasonable than going out on ones own.

				I guess I just don&#039;t get the hate for the grocery options here. I&#039;m no gourmet, but I try to cook a couple times a week. I&#039;m able to find everything I need between trade fair and the produce places on 37th at 77th and 78th. I don&#039;t usually shop at Met foods unless I can&#039;t find it at trade fair. I guess I just don&#039;t buy into the whole organic craze, which I think is mostly first world selfishness. I realize that to feed the close to 7 billion people on this planet, we need pesticides and genetically modified foods. I wouldn&#039;t do the bulk of my shopping at a whole foods type place even if it were in the neighborhood, because I think it&#039;s a waste of money.

				I&#039;m surprised to hear a complaint about our grocery stores. There&#039;s no Fairway or Whole Foods but there is a Trade Fair, Met Foods, Korean supermarket, Pacific supermarket, Apna Bazaar, Patel Brothers, and quite a few others no matter which direction you go. It&#039;s a reason why so many people love this area. <br /><br />And as far as eating healthy, there are lots of Indian and Nepalese places which are great for your health. I would skip the Colombian places though... I have no idea what&#039;s healthy there. oh wait, smoothies! it&#039;s either really healthy or unhealthy.<br /><br />But as far as the subject matter.... All the area needs is one cool bar and it will all come. And we&#039;ll all complain about the people who don&#039;t appreciate the area for what it is, the snobbishness, and the high prices.

				So one thing about Blueroom&#039;s list is that it&#039;s kind of a stereotypical list of &quot;things people without children like to do.&quot; And as we&#039;ve discussed many times before, JH isn&#039;t much of a neighborhood for singles - it&#039;s VERY family oriented. I&#039;ve found JH and Astoria to be in a very close symbiosis over the past decade, where people in Astoria tend to breed and then move to JH.<br /><br />&quot;No decent brunch spots&quot; - What about Jax Inn? Decent food, nice big booths. Or the French toast at 77.<br />&quot;No restaurants serving healthy food&quot; - What do you mean by &quot;healthy?&quot; I don&#039;t really find any restaurant food healthy.<br />&quot;No place for drinks&quot; - Legends, Novo, Coyote, Natives come to mind.<br />Buying meat, etc? - isn&#039;t that what the Farmer&#039;s Market is all about? And it&#039;s the second biggest one in NYC.<br /><br />I mean, Blueroom is defining a lifestyle where - and I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s Blueroom&#039;s lifestyle, but it&#039;s being defined by this list - where you go out with friends a lot of nights, cook leisurely meals from exotic ingredients at home, and have time to indulge in things like fitness. That&#039;s not a lifestyle that most of my harried working-parent friends in JH have been able to live for at least five or ten years now. On other other hand, it&#039;s the lifestyle we had in Astoria ... before we had the kids.

				I agree - Jackson Heights has a lot going for it. I&#039;ve lived in a many neighborhoods in NYC, and it&#039;s always a compromise. The restaurants and food stores in JH are great.&nbsp; Remember - there&#039;s no such thing as a LITTLE gentrification.&nbsp; I think alot of us will be complaining when JH does gentrify.&nbsp; In the mean time try to spend as much of your money locally that you can - that&#039;s what is going to attract new businesses into the area.

Should people who don&#039;t have children move away from here? Do people who do have young children not want extra amenities? Do people with teenage children who have more time for themselves not want those things? Should the older adults move elsewhere or should they not want access to those things as well? I know several retired professional couples who live here who miss not having better amenities. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s possible for a neighborhood to serve everyone&#039;s needs, especially as diverse a neighborhood as this. I don&#039;t think this is about being single versus having children--it&#039;s about having a neighborhood with reasonable amenities for all. A gym is not too much to ask for. <br /><br />As for your suggestions, I appreciate them. I&#039;m not keen on diners, but they&#039;re good once in a while. As for healthy food, what about something like Bareburger (I know, you&#039;ll tell me to move to Astoria). I do buy meat at the farmer&#039;s market, and the market is quite great. It&#039;s definitely one of the biggest shining stars of this neighborhood. As for those bars, I&#039;ve been to a couple of them you mention, and I don&#039;t see me and female friends going there. I think finding bars here to occasionally go to with friends is a lot easier if you&#039;re a guy.<br /><br />

				&quot;If you&#039;ve been reading this forum since the beginning, you will know that this topic comes up with great regularity. A different topic title, but same stuff.<br /><br />JH is what it is. The changes will come gradually.<br /><br />If anyone knows some investors who want to open a pub, restaurant, bookstore, wine bar, gym, social meeting center - and I almost forgot - movie theater, then bring them over to check out JH. If you know someone like Julie and Afzal of E77, have them talk to them. Their fine place was ground-breaking.

				I am writing to &#039;Blueroom&#039; hope to help you out a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;I want to share a few special places with you. My husband and I have been here for 6 yrs now, we are both professionals, have done a lot of traveling, have lived in Manhatten &amp; Brookly. We adore speciality, ethnic foods . I understand your frustrations in JH, but there may be some places you have overlooked, and I highly recommend to venture to Northern Boulevard, it is worth the walk.<br /><br />Good Quality cuts of meat: you must visit a Carniceria( Butcher store) South Americans are very particular about their meat, there are a few on 37th, one on a corner, On 90 or 91, Had one of the best skirt steaks ever, brought to a party in Shelter Island last yr, my husband grilled it, everyone raves, and still talks about that cut of meat!<br /><br />Gourmet European Deli: The Polish Deli on 37 th avenue 80th, good european cheeses, cookies, jams, etc, etc. <br /><br />Gourmet Spanish Food Store: Despana, 86-17 Northern blvd, I have to plead with my husband to stop going here sometimes! Offers an array of cheese and sausages from Spain, they carry many Spanish Olive Oils, and other unique spanish food &amp; treats. Small place, They actually supply many of NYC&#039;s wine bars with their cheeses and jamons...They also have a store on Broome st.<br /><br />Best Bar, lovely atmosphere, is Amaru, &nbsp;84-13 Northern Blvd. Best time to visit is during the week, not crowded, but weekends it turns more in to a club after 10:00. Early on weekends is fine. Their specialty is Piscos, they actually make them using an Artisanal method, it is one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The also serve some nice h&#039;orderves, good ceviche. Next store is a pretty new gourmet pizza restaurant Pagliaccio, delicious.<br /><br />Best of luck, I hope you enjoy some of these suggestions:)

				There&#039;s also Terraza (http://www.terrazacafe.com/), which is a cool little bar on Gleane street, a tiny bit south of Roosevelt on 83rd street. It&#039;s a small bar, but it has a lot going for it:<br /><br />- Very diverse crowd<br />- Several draft beers (!!!)<br />- Really eclectic and interesting lineup of events on most nights, ranging from movie screenings to poetry nights (1st Tuesday of every month) to a huge variety of really good bands playing all kinds of music<br />- A unique space, it has to be seen to be believed (that suspended stage...)<br /><br />It&#039;s the kind of bar I would go to even if it wasn&#039;t just about the only place in our neighborhood with draft beer and a nice crowd.

Different neighborhoods tend to cater to different kinds of people. For instance, I don&#039;t know a lot of families who live in Northside Williamsburg, LIC, or SoHo. These neighborhoods definitely all used to be more demographically diverse, but there&#039;s been a pretty aggressive sorting going on of the past 20 years between &quot;play&quot; neighborhoods full of bustling fun for 20-somethings and &quot;family&quot; neighborhoods with cheap groceries and decent schools. There are plenty of older people without kids in my building, but they live quieter lifestyles.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think it&#039;s possible for a neighborhood to serve everyone&#039;s needs, especially as diverse a neighborhood as this.

A gym is not too much to ask for. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But restaurants like Bareburger aren&#039;t &quot;reasonable amenities.&quot; They&#039;re poncy hipster food for pretentious yuppies. They&#039;re very niche, a specific niche. Think of it as a kind of ethnic food. A gym, yes, that I&#039;ll give you, but one neighborhood can&#039;t fulfill every possible ethnic food niche. We do pretty well in JH, but that&#039;s why we live in NYC as a whole - because we can travel across the city and see *all* niches fulfilled. I like hipster burgers as much as anyone, but I&#039;m happy to travel for them, much as I&#039;m happy to travel for Persian or Ethiopian. Do all neighborhoods have to be hipster neighborhoods?<br /><br />Gyms, on the other hand, I agree that everybody goes to gyms. Isn&#039;t there one on Northern, like, in the low 70s?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As for those bars, I&#039;ve been to a couple of them you mention, and I don&#039;t see me and female friends going there.

Or E77&#039;s evenings where they have beer and wine? Legends is definitely an old-school sports-watching bar, but a lot of the women I know tend to go to Novo. I also had forgotten about Amaru, another good idea.

				theplanesland, I think you are being unnecessarily judgmental and putting forth a very black and white viewpoint. &nbsp;Most of us do not fit neatly into the categories of &quot;single and wants to party hardy&quot; and &quot;has kids and content with cheap groceries.&quot; &nbsp;I am in my 20s and born and raised in Queens and I moved to Jackson Heights because I love Queens, wanted to be close-ish to Astoria where I am from originally, and was attracted by the ability to live like an adult here instead of living the &#039;lifestyle&#039; of 5 drunk roommates. &nbsp;Also, as a minority myself I love how diverse it is. &nbsp;I love all that it affords me and actually my immediate wishes for the neighborhood don&#039;t concern retail as much as it concerns a more respectful living space with residents that respect public areas and more crackdown on the illegal activity that takes place in our neighborhood like the street office furniture sales, ob/gyns that operate with 3 suspended licenses, illegally zoned businesses in residential spaces. &nbsp;<br /><br />That said, there is a huge difference between wishing for ONE centrally located bar/food place, like Sparrow in Astoria on 37 ave than turning this place into 20something Vomit City like WBurg. &nbsp;Last I checked Sparrow has not spawned a thousand little &quot;Sparrows&quot; and it has not put the beer garden in Astoria out of business nor pushed the Chinese take out and pizza places that have been on 24th avenue forever. &nbsp;It is simply a nice place for people to hang out, from parents with strollers and Greek teenagers to the big actor community that lives there. &nbsp;Anyway, my most immediate desire isn&#039;t even for a cafe or whatever. &nbsp;I even think our grocery stores are great and I only wish there were a greek-style butcher/fish monger as I don&#039;t eat beef but love lamb and fish. &nbsp;The farmer&#039;s market meat is good but as you know it is VERY pricy. I&#039;d like to have a good medium between the super pricy organic meats and the factory assembly stuff you see at the supermarket. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, for the record, Novo is okay but but unexpectedly on some night turns into a reggaeton club. &nbsp;Which for a woman that goes in when its quiet enjoying a glass of wine it&#039;s a bit weird. <br />&nbsp;

				Novo turns into a club usually about once a weeknight and on the weekends.&nbsp; It&#039;s about the only place open after 10pm on 37th Avenue though when walking home from the train on that particular stretch of avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just wanted to pipe in and thank those of you who made some great suggestions..&nbsp; We&#039;re a very diverse group of people here and this board reflects that.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think a real gym, less crime, clean streets, and a few more places to go to with friends after 10pm&nbsp; that aren&#039;t strip clubs and caberet joints is too much to ask for,&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Believe me, I do very much appreciate what we do have.&nbsp; Thanks to those with suggestions - they&#039;ve been great!

				Hey People,<br />I was talking to a couple of officers on 37th about moving into a coop near Roosevelt. They gave me a discouraging &quot;I wouldn&#039;t not recommend it&quot; (foot patrol officer), while officers in a vehicle told me they wouldn&#039;t recommend it, and there is high crime in the area.&nbsp; Since we are the eyes and ears of the neighborhood and many of us look like to be from different generations and living in the area for years , what kind of crime do we see or hear about? Curious...<br /><br />Do we all feel safe during the day? Night?<br /><br />

				here&#039;s a site with precinct by precinct stats, with JH being the 115th<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_statistics.shtml<br /><br />i feel totally safe coming home -- i live on 35th at 77th and walk from the roosevelt station at all hours (well, post 2 AM, i usually take a cab, more from being tired) and don&#039;t see any problems.<br /><br />i don&#039;t spend a lot of time on roosevelt at night, but during daytime walks, it&#039;s fine -- although the guys trying to sell fake social security cards do get annoying. stretches of the avenue itself in the mid to upper 90s can be sketchy, but i&#039;m guessing youre not talking that far up?<br /><br />in my experience, in every new york neighborhood i&#039;ve lived in -- Jackson Heights, Astoria, Greenpoint, Lower East Side, Flatbush and Bed-Stuy -- cops have antipathy for the place. some of that is understandable; they spend FAR more time with the negative elements of society than with the average resident. <br /><br />unfortunately, many of them also genuinely dislike the city -- which is why so few of them live in it, and fight so hard to make sure they don&#039;t have to. some are racist, some just naturally gravitate to suburban life -- which i&#039;ve never experienced, as a city dweller since birth.<br /><br />but i&#039;d say there should be no issues.

				I think day time is completely fine. As discussed on this topic of attractive/ classy, etc. it still has some way to go but I love the best of both worlds.&nbsp; Night time though I&#039;m skeptical about since some of the bars on Roosevelt attract a few unsavory characters.&nbsp; We were looking at a coop on 80th and 37th.<br /><br />I agree completely with many cops having antipathy for the places since they do spend Far more time with the negative elements.&nbsp; And of course many are out of touch with any type of neighborhood like JH in comparison to where they are from.&nbsp; Crime has reduced and NYC in general has improved in almost all aspects of standard of life since 20 years back, but Im still indecisive!

				I think dssjh hit the nail on the head. &nbsp;Cops tend be a certain &#039;type&#039; and as being that they deal primarily with the underbelly of any given neighborhood they patrol in most of them won&#039;t have many positive things to say about any neighborhood of NYC unless it is VERY high income and homogeneous, such as the UES/UWS or Tribeca. &nbsp;I went to the big pride parade 2 years ago and literally witnessed a cop weeping in the corner and hiding in a nail salon because he was so upset by the &#039;displays&#039; going on outside. &lt;eye roll&gt;<br /><br />So, on the Jackson Heights fan spectrum I&#039;m pretty even keeled, I appreciate the neighborhood and I also see that it has some problems. &nbsp;BUT I will say (and I hope I don&#039;t regret saying this and get jumped tonight) that the majority of the crime seems to be insular - if you aren&#039;t a South American gang member or the owner of a South Asian brothel (which apparently is a big issue in the neighborhood - a friend getting her public health masters @ Columbia recently did a project on this very subject in JH), then you have nothing to worry about. &nbsp;It sucks because we do SEE it and we feel the seediness, but we&#039;re not of that world.<br /><br />Having lived in NYC all my life and being an Astoria native I am actually pretty ashamed to admit that the amount of petty crime in Astoria seems to be substantially greater than the amount of petty crime in Jackson Heights. &nbsp;Now, that COULD be because my parents own a house, but we&#039;ve been subject to break in attempts, as a child I&#039;ve gotten my bike stolen several times, friends have had their cars broken into, during the hurricane someone broke into my parents garage and siphoned gas from my dad&#039;s SUV, etc. &nbsp;And we own in a very very nice part of Astoria - the Ditmars proper area where home owners have beautiful well kept front yards and nice bay windows and very tidy rows of houses (not apartments) within blocks of the Q train. &nbsp;This past year, I&#039;ve had 3 friends in Brooklyn who had their apts broken into (Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, and Bushwick) and I had 2 friends get mugged (Washington Heights, Harlem). In a way, I think Jackson Height&#039;s lack of substantial income disparity insulates it from the type of crime that you as a middle-income person would be subjected to. &nbsp;Unlike those areas in BK and even Astoria, JH is not a gentrified pocket surrounded by very poor projects.<br /><br />Asides from that, as a young woman, while I don&#039;t feel immediate danger there is a substantial lonely male immigrant population here that lends itself to annoying catcalls and creepy stares. &nbsp;I got followed home once but luckily the brightly lit 24 hour Trade Fair is a good safe zone near my apt to duck into. I never walk on Roosevelt and avoid it like the plague - I even strategically pick an exit on the 74th street stop that deposits me right on 74 away from Roosevelt to get on the train.

				I&#039;ll be straight with you. &nbsp;As a female, I don&#039;t feel safe walking home alone along any stretch of Roosevelt late at night, especially weekends. &nbsp; There&#039;s a reason we&#039;ve got a lot of police paddy wagons in the area at night. &nbsp;I also don&#039;t love the desolate walk home on 37th Avenue - most places close at 10pm so your walk home is super quiet. &nbsp;Drunk dudes have followed me home twice. &nbsp;(My boyfriend gets hit on as well so this is not strictly a girl thing.) &nbsp;That being said, this happens in Manhattan too and in Astoria. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think Jackson Heights is unique in this regard, but I will say it&#039;s the Amsterdam of New York - plenty of underground or plain out in the open prostitution, strip clubs, caberet clubs, sports bars, etc. This is I&#039;m sure what the police deal with every night. &nbsp;And then, like Amsterdam, you go down one avenue and it&#039;s beautiful. &nbsp;Landscaped gardens, amazing architecture. &nbsp;Night and day. &nbsp;Do I feel unsafe? &nbsp;Well - if you tend to just avoid Roosevelt late nights - then the area is fine. &nbsp;I live on the block you&#039;ve mentioned and it&#039;s quite nice here. &nbsp;Just get off the train and walk away from Roosevelt. &nbsp;

				Streets under an El are crappy. Els make streets much less pleasant. Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside escapes because QB is so darn wide that the El doesn&#039;t shade it and cover it with bird poop, but Roosevelt Avenue is basically doomed by the 7, 31st Street is the least pleasant street in Astoria, and for that matter the avenues covered by Els in Brooklyn (unless they&#039;re super-wide) aren&#039;t lovely places to be either.<br /><br />But as others have said just above, the El effect never seems to spread to the surrounding neighborhood. I find this in Jackson Heights: Roosevelt Avenue is icky, pretty much perpetually in shade, noisy and guano-covered, and then even a building or two north everything&#039;s much better. It&#039;s very limited to that one avenue.

				I can understand Mr. Columbia&#039;s frustration. There are neighborhoods surrounding JH (of the same socioeconomic makeup) that are much cleaner than JH, (in my opinion) and JH should be much cleaner.&nbsp; I wonder why Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside manage but we do not. I wonder sometimes if JH is not as nice as it should be because of some kind of malign neglect.<br /><br />Telling someone to &quot;move&quot; because of a criticism is ridiculous.

				How do you make the area more trendy?<br />Stop going to Starbucks. Go to Alchemy BBQ. Alchemy is as trendy a food you can get in nyc right now and it&#039;s a shame that its not Packed every night. They are pretty much the only game in town for this type of scene. Also it&#039;s excellent at times, and when it&#039;s not that&#039;s because they aren&#039;t getting enough business and the food is getting dry. The more popular they are, the better they will get. For everyone complaining that the area isn&#039;t trendy enough, put you money where your type is. <br />I have no clue their financial situation, but if JH does not pack the place regularly, why would any other progressive,trendy restaurant open up here?<br /><br />It&#039;s a real shame. I was there Thursday night, it was tepidly half full. Passed by Starbucks afterward and it was hopping. Why would anyone open up here if the local businesses aren&#039;t emphatically supported? You have been asking for this for a long time and its here. If there isn&#039;t an overflow of business, there won&#039;t be another one. All of your friends are interested in Jackson heights, invite them over. This area is totally a destination. No one is going to move here because of a Starbucks. If the area doesn&#039;t support a local, excellent business like this, there won&#039;t be any more. <br /><br />Right now, the Himalayan places are thriving and growing in number.&nbsp; Why? Take a peek into Phayul,it&#039;s packed. Friends Cafe opened 2 weeks ago, it&#039;s packed. Put your patronage in the local economy, don&#039;t even consider Starbucks.

				beautifully said, Jeff:<br /><br />i think we&#039;re dealing with a classic case of perception versus reality here. alchemy is on the front line of the biggest food trend in new york right now, and the tastemakers love it. it IS trendy, but it doesn&#039;t LOOK trendy, so people can&#039;t believe that.<br /><br />the same is true for the himalayan spots in a lot of ways. i have friends in other boroughs who make special plans to come out to eat at phayul or zomsa because they&#039;ve heard suc good things in roundups about the rising trend of nepalese/tibetan eating. a trend, but what i often hear locally is &quot;oh no, another one of those?&quot;<br /><br />some people have this frozen, hipster Norman Rockwell image of what trendy is. but by the time that image is set, it&#039;s no longer trendy, it&#039;s passe, and the new trend is brewing.<br /><br />and, for what it&#039;s worth, i&#039;ve never been inside that starbucks. i&#039;ve only been in starbucks three times in my life, twice on the NJ turnpike.

				&quot;Can we make Jackson Heights more attractive, classy and Trendy?&quot;<br /><br />I personally hope never...not the way some people define &quot;attractive,&quot; anyway. It&#039;s already very attractive to me as it is, namely its diversity and its location. It&#039;s interesting what some people define as &quot;classy&quot; and &quot;attractive.&quot; Does one mean less brown people and less working and middle class people?<br /><br />In any case, every single neighborhood I&#039;ve lived in on both coasts of the US that&#039;s gone the way of &quot;trendy&quot; has priced me and other folks in a similar income bracket, only to be replaced by the moneyed who just consume, rather than produce, and thereby drive up the prices. To be honest, that&#039;s how I ended up in JH from Brooklyn. <br /><br />I feel very passionately about gentrification and what it does to neighborhoods and the residents living in it and generally, I tend it view it unfavorably. Yes, JH right now doesn&#039;t have every single thing imaginable, but the beauty of it is that I&#039;m within walking distance of several neighborhoods that offers basically anything that I need and desire. For a few things, there&#039;s the subway to Manhattan. I&#039;d much, much rather prefer it like this than JH becoming a concentration of &quot;trendiness&quot; that will have effectively pushed out the very people that have made JH what it is. The Village, SoHo, Tribeca, etc are all &quot;trendy,&quot; but culturally, I find it really homogenous, boring, and pretentious in my more ungenerous moods. That&#039;s the thing about rich people--they come in with their money and kick out the very people who made those neighborhoods vibrant, vivacious, and trendy, and turn it into a bland wasteland full over overpriced restaurants with mediocre foods at best. <br /><br />If one wants trendiness, &quot;classy&quot; (what a term, frankly), and attractiveness, one can always move to SoHo, Park Slope, whatever. One cannot have everything in one place, especially in an American urban city.

				There are things that can be done that don&#039;t fall into the category of gentrification: noise, garbage, illegal housing etc. If we accomplished just those - JH would be a far more livable place.

I&#039;ve lived in working class neighborhoods in Bronx, Manhattan and now Queens and I&#039;ve never seen such denial.

				so 99 cent stores are what the JH residents deserve and want?&nbsp; We wouldn&#039;t prefer a decent housewares stores with higher quality merchandise than the toxic wasteland of the JH discount store? I&#039;m not talking Gracious Home.

				Reality check.<br /><br />Jackson Heights is diverse. <br /><br />Sure there are some middle class folks in and around the historic district...(and on this forum) but the vast majority who shop here are immigrant working class...(who are not on this forum. And probably can&#039;t express themselves fluently in English should they inadvertantly find themselves on this forum)...Open your eyes and look around...They seek bargains. <br /><br />And businesses simply cater to their needs in order to turn a profit....(due the numbers).&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s no more complicated than that.<br /><br />I would say the number of folks living in the Historic District is what?&nbsp; 5,000?<br />But the number living around it, shopping here might number what? 70,000?<br /><br />Businessmen are not fools.&nbsp; They just cater to the largest market. <br /><br />The 99 cent stores are always busy as far as I can see. And the most popular new restaurant that opened is a fast food fried chicken place on 37th Ave, from what I notice. <br /><br />From a business angle, it&#039;s quite simple really.<br /><br />Apart from that, I find the stores here very quirky...even if they are 99 cent stores...or fast food joints...they&#039;re not chains...and so each seems to have its own weird and distinct personality...From being followed to check I&#039;m not stealing...in a Roosevelt Ave 99cent...with no please or thank yous....or even a word exchanged during the transaction at the till...to having pleasant conversations with one of the cashiers on 37th Ave...<br /><br />So even in our 99 cent stores...we have diversity!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, it does seem LIC will soon be our go-to location for artisanal cheeses and fancier shopping.&nbsp; Thankfully it&#039;s close. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This thread is 11 pages long now, so it has definitely caught the attention of folks who have computers.<br /><br />For fun (yes, a quirky kind of fun) I went back to page 1 and read the whole thing. <br /><br />If you have the time, do a scan. The subject wanders every once and a while, but is very interesting reading.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the landlords are not on here. Or if so, making no defense of the pricing.<br /><br />Kudos to all who care about JH and are willing to get out there and do things that might not be classy or trendy,<br />but in the spring when all the bulbs planted bloom, we will look terrific!<br />

				The more subway lines and bus routes a neighborhood has, the more it attracts poor people. And, Jackson Heights has one of the most subway lines and bus routes of NYC.

				Jackson Heights has historically been a subway hub, even in it&#039;s more affluent days. Indeed it was this fact that made it an attractive community to the upper and middle class community that founded it as a &quot;Garden City.&quot;

				Look the guy voiced an opinion, even if it was awkwardly worded. i think he meant that lower income people would be attracted to an area where they could get to a lot of different places to work for a relatively small amount of money.<br /><br />&nbsp;It is true that lower income people have to rely on public transportation but middle income people do too. When I had no money I took the subway, now that things are better I&#039;m still grateful. I don&#039;t think that the&nbsp; number of subway lines is the reason we don&#039;t have more quality shops and restaurants. But eventually it could be one of the contributing factors as to how we&#039;ll get them. And historically it was the subways that opened up the area to real estate investors. There&#039;d be no &quot;Garden City&quot; without the subway lines.
