				A NYT piece mentioning an idea to create a select bus line linking the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, that would have a stop in Jackson Heights:<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/opinion/a-straphangers-campaign.html?hp&amp;_r=0<br /><br />It&#039;s called the &quot;Triboro Rx Line&quot; -- or just the &quot;X line&quot; -- and was first proposed in 1996. It would use a railroad path that the city already has the right of way. The difference now is that the proposal is to use select bus service -- &quot;express buses in dedicated lanes, like rubber-wheeled trains&quot; -- instead of subway trains. It is included in Christine Quinn&#039;s agenda and she says that buses would make it cheaper and faster to implement.<br /><br />I dug a bit to see if I could find the stops, and found this link, from a guy who worked on the project: http://frumin.net/ation/2007/06/le_triboro_rx.html. You can download a GoogleEarth file here with the stops: http://transit.frumin.net/trx/data/kml/trx-subway-network.kml<br /><br /><strong>In short, 2 JH stops:</strong> 74th st and Northern Blvd. The northbound express bus would connect JH directly to Astoria, up to the Yankee Stadium. The southbound route would go to Ridgewood, Sunset Park and end at Bay Ridge in Brooklyn.

				Difficult to say. First, Quinn would need to be elected. She is currently leading the polls, but who knows who will win. Second, if she wins, then she&#039;d need to be willing to fulfill her promise and gather support.<br /><br />Long story short: she claims on her website that if select bus services were used instead of trains, &quot;the proposal would cost an estimated $25 million, compared with the Rx subwayâ€™s $1 billion bill.&quot; Here her link about it: http://www.quinnfornewyork.com/busservice<br /><br />If this math is right, $25 million would be a much easier sell than $1 billion. Therefore, it may increase the likelihood that it may happen. But who knows.<br />

				Very interesting. The term for this is &quot;bus rapid transit,&quot; and it has been used with considerable success in Los Angeles, Seattle and elsewhere. Buses are cheaper and more flexible than trains; they run for all or part of the route in a dedicated paved busway, with no interfering traffic. The plan you describe would be quite useful I think, especially if it connects with existing transit lines. I type with fingers crossed.

				BRT/SBS are not &quot;like rubber wheeled trains.&quot;<br /><br />Take a nice long look at First and Second Avenues. While the SBS buses are definitely better than all-stop buses, they have to stop at lights, they have to weave in and out of regular traffic lanes because of double-parkers and deliveries, and they get caught in the same traffic everyone else does. Quinn&#039;s plan for Triboro RX looks to me a heck of a lot more like the Q44 Ltd than anything else - just another limited-stop bus that gets choked down in the surface traffic that makes our bus system often slower than walking.

				BRT works well in most cities that have it. SBS not so much.
