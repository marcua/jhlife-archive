					I hope ECG, JackM, and others realize that my last post was a very sarcastic response to the annoying remarks made about &quot;ethnics,&quot; the &quot;low classes,&quot; and people talking about getting something they could call their &quot;own.&quot; Just because many haven&#039;t said anything doesn&#039;t mean that people aren&#039;t reading them. Talk all you want about what you want to see in a potential business, but leave out the race and poor people talk from the equation, as those two things are entirely irrelevant. You do realize that nonwhites are posting here, yes? And you do realize that there are businesses whose owners are not white and they contribute posts here? If they are being all-inclusive and all-embracing, why can&#039;t some of you be the same? Or maybe some of you think it&#039;s normal to have those kinds of racial hangups. Like I said in my previous post, I have heard people in person vent their racial angst against nonwhites here in JH, so maybe many think it&#039;s OK. If you really do feel that way and you&#039;re unable to remedy your noxious feelings, maybe you can contribute to a &quot;community&quot; fund to buy yourselves a chunk of JH and build a gated biosphere complete with a shopping district of your &quot;own&quot; and walkable tubes that allow you to get to the Roosevelt train station without having to interact with others. Then the racist and classist whining can fade out and the rest of us don&#039;t have to hear it anymore.<br /><br /><br /><br />

We&#039;ve been fortunate to line up a highly regarded chef to helm our kitchen and are excited for the opportunity to bring their food to Jackson Heights. This is the kind of place that will keep you local on date night; the kind of place where you can get a quick dinner with the kids without compromising on quality (where is that chicken from exactly?); the kind of place where you can enjoy a quality beverage in an inviting atmosphere, and is above all affordable and <strong>welcoming to all</strong>.

Forums like this are usually dominated by a very, very vocal minority who either have something to always complain about and/or vested interests, while the vast majority of the &quot;community&quot; probably doesn&#039;t even know about the existence of the forum and/or definitely does not comment as often, if at all. However, if you&#039;re looking to target a particular demographic group, then this forum seems like a good place to start at (and probably contains multiple laundry lists that you can refer to when you think about catering to their wants). I personally don&#039;t see anything lacking--on 37th, there are places you can get brunch, alcoholic drinks, burgers, whatever, as I&#039;ve done all of that on 37th, Roosevelt, and Northern--but that&#039;s just me. If you&#039;re really looking to make money, you should totally target the whites of JH, capitalize on their frustrations and anger, offer your establishment as the solution, and charge really high prices for it. They will pay for it if they feel like it&#039;s their one and only refuge, the only place where the patrons are not mostly of color, and the aisles are large enough for the SUV-sized strollers that usually take up 3/4 of most of the establishments on 37th. Trust me, I have lived in enough neighborhoods to know this how you do it. If you&#039;d like to receive a more detailed consultation, feel free to PM me!<br /><br />Best of luck!

					Aw, I kind of feel for the vocal whites of Jackson Heights. Give them a diner they can call their &quot;own&quot; which offers &quot;New American&quot; in an otherwise stagnant, dreary, ethnic, lower class sea!<br /><br />Some of you are incredibly rude. You write things like this as if the forum is an exclusive country club composed of white folks that does not have any nonwhite visitors. Sadly, I have heard some of these racist and anti-non Christian sentiments (before they are edited by the moderator) voiced on here echoed on the streets of JH. I haven&#039;t even been here a year and I&#039;ve already witnessed whites tell off people of South Asian descent to &quot;go home&quot; twice. It&#039;s so remarkable to me that people who were, at the time of said incidents, so outnumbered, felt entirely comfortable in doing this in broad daylight, on 37th and 74th. I guess it speaks to power--not so much about numbers, but in privilege.<br />

					Agree with dssjh, very useful tips, toque198! I found a few other resources in case anyone wants to know more about choosing and handling fish, and sustainability:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm077331.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm077331.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.fishwatch.gov/buying_seafood/choosing_quality.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.fishwatch.gov/buying_seafood/choosing_quality.htm</a><br /><br /><br />Superclam, about the lobsters...sounds funny to watch, but not to eat <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Mi Tierra supposedly has a seafood department, which I&#039;ll take a look at when I go to check this supermarket out (haven&#039;t been yet), but I am going to get from Pacific first to make burgers. I&#039;ll report back!<br />

					Thanks, Shelby. The Ocean Fish Market has organic salmon (and some other wonderful things). There&#039;s also the New Best of the Sea in Astoria. Have you tried it? <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-of-the-sea-astoria" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-of-the-sea-astoria</a> And the Astoria Seafood which cooks what you got, the way you like it! <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/astoria-seafood-long-island-city" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.yelp.com/biz/astoria-seafood-long-island-city</a><br /><br />I had in mind Pacific Supermarket, since I go there often for cheaper produce. They have a large seafood department and once I saw a guy get about $30 worth of salmon steaks, so it can&#039;t be bad...but I&#039;m just always hesitant and paranoid in general about seafood and where it&#039;s coming from, so I never buy it from anywhere (I should research seafood quality in NYC so that potentially unfounded fears don&#039;t get the best of me). Would love to have stalls of freshly-caught seafood but even typing that out made me laugh out loud. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/pacific-supermarket-elmhurst" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.yelp.com/biz/pacific-supermarket-elmhurst</a>

					Any recommendations on where to buy good quality seafood at good prices in JH/Woodside/vicinity? I&#039;ve frequented the Asian supermarkets along Broadway, but haven&#039;t bought anything from the seafood department.

I was there today and was floored by all the variety offered there. And the hot bar smelled heavenly. Some produce is considerably cheaper there: I saw plum tomatoes for 0.99/lb. (in great condition, as opposed to the approx. $1.50/lb. for much less quality), and some seasonal produce. <br /><br />Another market I&#039;m a fan of in Astoria is Greenbay Market. The organic produce is at great, affordable prices. They also serve food, along with vegan desserts. They&#039;ve recently expanded the store&#039;s offerings by including imported cheeses (you know I&#039;m a fan of those! <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />). <br /><br /><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/greenbay-market-astoria" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.yelp.com/biz/greenbay-market-astoria</a>

					Thanks to all who posted the appropriate links to more info and filing a complaint. I know that in the past I sort of blew off the disturbance with proposing earplugs, but the past week or so has been exceptionally bad--the noise just seeps through my earplugs now, that&#039;s how much. It seems like the planes are flying lower than before and are back-to-back throughout the entire day. Been feeling like I&#039;ve been flying back and forth across the country myself (I&#039;m a bit closer to the airport than others in JH, so maybe I&#039;m getting it worse than others).
