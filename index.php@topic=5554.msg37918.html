								<div class="inner" id="msg_37906">&nbsp;For how long is the money to be lent? When does Councilman Dromm have the check? I believe Mr.R. said if there were monies<br />today, the councilman should bring a pen to sign real estate papers. But when does the city give the timeline? If someone lends <br />money in any case there needs to be a timeline. This should cover things until ....(fill in working dates).<br />&nbsp;This is a real sticking point in the sale which is especially of concern to those many of us who are both Grow a Park supporters <br />and Garden School supporters. Details from City Hall are needed soonest. Put pressure on them to give this answer so it&#039;s all a go!</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37911">With all due respect to the staff and board at the Garden School, as well as the students and the parents, I have to agree with Dudley. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Garden School has a lot going for it. &nbsp;It is part of our communityâ€™s history. &nbsp;It has a great after school program in the arts and music. &nbsp;By all accounts, students and parents do feel like an extended family.<br /><br />But over the years, the Garden School has made the decision to, on many levels, set itself apart from the larger community. &nbsp;More recent educational institutions, such as the Renaissance School and 82nd Street Academics have integrated themselves into the fabric of the community through linkages and partnerships and activities that reflect a concern not only for their students and their families, but also for the larger community. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Garden School, it seems, has not even looked at the changing demographics of the neighborhood in recent years, and recognized that the influx of more middle class and upper middle class families with young children should be bringing them lots of business.&nbsp; Instead, they prefer to reach out to Manhattan families and families from more affluent Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods, who find them more economical than Manhattan private schools. &nbsp;<br /><br />When my daughter was 2, I took a tour of their preschool, and seriously considered it as an option for the following year. &nbsp;The program looked great. &nbsp;But I was baffled by the fact that they did not run a UPK program for 4 year olds. &nbsp;Why would I pay for something that should be free for all NY kids? &nbsp;Many active, involved parents who plan carefully for their childrenâ€™s education start looking at quality UPK programs at least a year or two in advance. &nbsp;I wanted to send my 3 year old to the school where she would attend UPK (plus extended day, paid for out of pocked) as a 4 year old. &nbsp;Why would the Garden School decide to exclude that huge pool of parents? &nbsp;It seems to me that a quality UPK program would not only bring money into the school for the kids attending UPK, but would also bring families into the school, a percentage of whom would undoubtedly decide to keep their kids there for kindergarten, and perhaps even through high school!<br /><br />In a neighborhood in which all of the other schools are bursting at the seems, why is the Garden School having low enrollment and financial problems? &nbsp;I believe that for many many years, they have dismissed the surrounding Jackson Heights community. &nbsp;And I believe that their recent actions demonstrate that they intend to continue to dismiss the community. &nbsp;<br /><br />Actually, it is worse than that. &nbsp;They have alienated the community that should be filling their classrooms. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As I research kindergartens for my daughter to attend next September, most of my first choices are schools with crazy competitive lotteries. &nbsp;Renaissance accepted 40 students out of 1400 applications last year. &nbsp;We will apply. &nbsp;We probably wonâ€™t get in. &nbsp; <br /><br />Up until a few weeks ago, the Garden School was my backup. &nbsp;My â€œsafety school.â€ &nbsp;If my daughter did not get into any of the other schools that we are applying to, I could figure out a way to pay the tuition at the Garden School. &nbsp;<br /><br />At this point, I am so mad at the Garden School, that I no longer consider them an option. &nbsp;And Iâ€™ve spoken with quite a few parents of Sept 2011 kindergarteners who feel the same way. &nbsp;<br /><br />As Dudley said, their behavior is â€œbizarre and inexplicable.â€ &nbsp;Unless they plan to sell out once the Race to the Top money, (which will create 64 new charter schools in 2012) starts flowing. &nbsp;<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37912">&nbsp;Choosing a school for one&#039;s child is often a consuming, passionate process. For people wanting a good fit, you start to realize how<br />few choices are that match with your wishes for your children. I wish you the best in your search and appreciate the good and bad<br />points you have made about Garden School. This could be helpful going forward. If 82nd street academics is at $12,000. for pre-k then<br />we are talking about more people in the neighborhood who can and do pay for schools. Along with some of the fine contributions by<br />the religious schools and charters like the lottery based-Renaissance, we do have some choices here but all the more reason to keep<br />Garden School thriving for those who are happy with their approach. Some of the local public schools are terrific for kids who can <br />function in a large classroom but hearing from a friend who is now home schooling a kindergardener who was in a class of 29 kids <br />and one new teacher, it&#039;s at a point where the more options, the better for the whole community. Diversity was a big priority to me<br />and Garden School fares very well here as well as complete language studies through the school years.<br />&nbsp;Have you looked at the charter school in Astoria? </div>

An applicant must file a standardized Land Use Review Application and all required accompanying documentation with the Department of City Planning (DCP). Copies of all applications and accompanying material are sent to the affected Borough President, Community Board and the City Council within five business days of receipt. If the application involves land in more than one community district it is also sent to the appropriate borough board. The Borough Board is comprised of the Borough President, all Community Board chairs and City Council members within the affected borough.<br /><br />Certification. DCP is responsible for certifying that the application is complete, and ready for public review through the ULURP process.<br /><br />An application cannot be certified until DCP determines that the application includes all forms, plans and supporting documents that are necessary to address all issues related to the application. If the particular application is subject to environmental review, a negative declaration or a conditional negative declaration or a notice of completion of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement must be issued before an application can be certified. There is no mandated time by which this pre-certification review must be completed. The Charter permits applicants or the affected Borough President to appeal to CPC for certification after six months from the date of application submission.<br /><br />Certified applications are sent within nine days to the affected Community Board, Borough President and the City Council and if appropriate, to the Borough Board.<br /><br />Community Board Review. Within sixty (60) days of receiving the certified application, the Community Board is required to hold a public hearing and adopt and submit a written recommendation to CPC, the applicant, the Borough President and when appropriate, the Borough Board. The ULURP rules include provisions relating to the notice and conduct of a Community Board public hearing. ULURP provisions also govern the quorum, vote and content for a Community Board recommendation. If a Community Board fails to act within its time limit or waives its right to act, the application proceeds to the next level of review.<br /><br />Borough President Review. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Community Board recommendation, or if the Community Board fails to act, within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the Community Board&#039;s review period, the Borough President shall submit a written recommendation to the City Planning Commission. If an application involves land in more than one community district, the Borough Board may (within the Borough President&#039;s review period) also review and submit a recommendation to CPC. If the Borough President fails to act within the time limit, the application proceeds to CPC.<br /><br />City Planning Commission Review. CPC must hold a public hearing and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the application within 60 days of the expiration of the Borough President&#039;s review period. City Planning Commission hearings are generally held twice a month on Wednesdays in Spector Hall at 22 Reade Street. Adoption of a CPC report approving, modifying or disapproving an application requires an affirmative vote of seven commissioners. If the Borough President has recommended against an application for site selection, disposition of city owned property or acquisition and has recommended an alternative site pursuant to the fair share provisions of the Charter (section 204), then nine affirmative votes are required. CPC then files copies of its decision with the City Council. In most cases, disapproval of an application by CPC is final and terminates ULURP. Disapproved applications for urban renewal plans are subject to Council review. In addition, disapproved applications for special permits, zoning text changes and zoning map changes that the Mayor has certified as necessary are subject to review by the City Council. (Note: No &quot;certificate of necessity&quot; has been issued by any mayor since ULURP went into effect).<br /><br />City Council Review. The City Council does not automatically review all ULURP actions that are approved by CPC. The Charter requires the Council to review certain actions, some only under special circumstances, and makes provision for the Council to elect to review other actions.<br /><br />The City Council automatically reviews (Mandatory Review):<br /><br />zoning map changes;<br />zoning text changes (not subject to ULURP but subject to Charter section 200 and 201);<br />housing and urban renewal plans;<br />disposition of residential buildings, except to non-profit companies for low-income housing<br />The Council may elect to review the following by voting to take jurisdiction within 20 days after CPC files its report (Council &quot;call-up&quot;):<br /><br />- City Map changes;<br />- maps of subdivisions or plattings;<br />- zoning special permits;<br />- revocable consents, franchise RFPâ€™s, and major concessions;<br />- non-City public improvements;<br />- sanitary and waterfront landfills;<br />- disposition of commercial or vacant property;<br />- disposition of residential buildings to nonprofit companies for low-income housing;<br />- acquisition of real property; and<br />- site selection.<br />Applications disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President (Triple no):<br /><br />An application which is subject to elective review by the Council, will be reviewed if that application was disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President, was approved or approved with modifications by the City Planning Commission, and the Borough President files an objection to CPC approval with the Council and CPC within 5 days of receipt of CPC&#039;s approval.<br />Within 50 days of receipt of the CPC report on an application that is either subject to mandatory review, is &quot;called-up&quot; by the Council, or is a &quot;triple no&quot; application, the Council must hold a public hearing, and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />If, during the course of its 50-day review period, the Council decides it wants to approve an application with a modification, it can do so only by referring the proposed modification back to CPC. CPC must then determine if the modification is of such significance that additional environmental review is necessary or that additional review pursuant to ULURP is required. If CPC determines that additional review is needed, the Council may not adopt the modification. If no additional review is needed, the Council can adopt the application with the modification. When the Council proposes a modification, CPC has 15 days to make its determination and during that period the City Council&#039;s 50-day clock is stopped.<br /><br />A City Council action approving, approving with modifications or disapproving most CPC actions, requires a majority vote of the Council. Urban Renewal Plans that have been disapproved by CPC can only be approved by a 3/4 vote of the Council.<br /><br />If the Council fails to act within its review period, the Council shall be deemed to have approved the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />Mayoral Review. Mayoral approval is not required. A decision by the City Council to approve or disapprove a land use application is considered to be final unless the Mayor elects to veto a Council action within 5 days of the vote. The Council, by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of its decision within 10 days of the veto.<br /><br />Applications approved by CPC that the Council did not assume jurisdiction or act on within its 50 day review can also be vetoed by the Mayor within 5 days of the expired Council time period. The Council , by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of the CPC decision within ten days of the veto. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37919">Has it occurred to anyone that the city is reluctant to invest resources (a.k.a taxpayer money) in to a process (ULURP) that may result in the school selling the land to a developer, which seems to be Mr. Rakosi&#039;s clear intention? If the school has cold feet about a deal with the city why would the &quot;Cash-strapped&quot; city invest the time and money in to a process that would merely result in a loss because of the Garden School&#039;s need for as much cash as they can get as soon as possible? <br /><br />Again, I find it necessary to point out that the &quot;Fiduciary Responsibility&quot; of the board, seems to have not been too much of a concern to them in the years leading up to their current financial situation. Yet, all of a sudden it is key to why they can&#039;t sign a deal with the city. &nbsp;<br /><br />The school stated publicly that they would be open to some sort of loan or &quot;option&quot; in the amount of $500,000.00 to cover operating costs while the city completed the ULURP process. The community raised over $250,000.00 in response to that ask, and apparently other organizations have expressed a willingness to loan the money to the school as well. Even Mr. Rakosi admits that he was the one who supported the idea of a community based loan and apparently even offered his own money towards it. But, suddenly it&#039;s not enough. Now they need more money and an iron clad guarantee. The constantly changing story form the Garden School leads one to believe they were never negotiating in good faith to begin with. Has anyone done any research on this Mr. Rakosi and his dealings? I&#039;m very , very skeptical. <br /><br />The &quot;cash strapped&quot; city even came up with more money to offer the school. A big feat in our current economic climate. So I can&#039;t understand why people are questioning how serious the city is about buying this land ? Does it make sense to anyone out there that the politicians involved would risk their reputations and the city (which is ultimately the Mayor) would simply play a game to get us all riled up and never deliver ? <br /><br />Further, if the School is so distrustful of the city, and their surrounding community who have raised an impressive amount in a short time, why have they not signed a deal with any one of the &quot;several developers&quot; they have an offer from? Why do they drag this out yet cry that they are in desperate need of funds ASAP? Seems to me like they could have signed a deal by now. <br /><br />Maybe they should do us all a favor by signing a deal with a developer who will put up an 8 story monstrosity and let the lack of open space along with their poor reputation run the school in to the ground. Then the community can step in and buy the property an turn it in to community center that <strong>truly</strong> benefits the neighborhood. <br /><br />It is very clear that the school&#039;s main market is not the immediate community, otherwise they would listen to the parents and people here who are willing to pitch in their hard earned money to help them stay afloat and develop a valuable community resource that would ensure their reputation and longevity in the neighborhood. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37927">Greetings,<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit confused.&nbsp; Is it true that community groups have helped raise substantial funds (hundreds of thousands of dollars?) and that the City has sweetened its offer to the Garden School to purchase the lot in question?&nbsp; <br /><br />If so, is there another community meeting planned--like the one that occurred in early January at Community Church on 82nd street--with community members, Garden School officials, elected officials and community groups?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I attended that meeting, where about 150 people came out on a snowy night.&nbsp; At that meeting, it was quite heartening to hear from nearly every participant -- including the representatives from the Garden School -- that the overwhelming preference on all sides was for the property in question to be sold to the City rather than to a developer, so that JH could preserve one of the last remaining and sorely needed open spaces in JH.&nbsp; Has something changed? <br /><br />Are there any plans for another meeting of the minds -- and above parties -- to discuss if/how we can make this happen?&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems like a great way to sort out what is what.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37930">Iâ€™m racking my brain to try and figure out what the problem is at this point.&nbsp; Why would the Garden School continue to want to sell to developers, after being offered both an exceptional offer from the City, coupled with generous community donations to tide them through until the City money comes?<br /><br />There has to be some reason, but I canâ€™t figure it out.&nbsp; Here are some absurd ideas, none of which I really believe.&nbsp; But I canâ€™t come up with anything better.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Sears (Garden School Board member and former City Council Rep) is so mad that she lost office after putting all of that money into Travers Park, and didnâ€™t get the park named after her, that she is not going to let the man who she lost the election to (Danny Dromm) lead a movement to improve park space in the community.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garden School has already decided it is about to fold, and is just looking to bring in some quick cash now to carry it through until the Race for the Top money starts flowing.&nbsp; (Race for the Top money will bring 64 new charter schools to NYC in 2012, 32 new charter schools in 2013, and 32 more in 2014.)&nbsp; &nbsp;They figure they have a fabulous facility that one of those charter schools will buy out.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schoolâ€™s financial mismanagement is so severe that they really desperately need the full $6 million to make it through the end of the school year.&nbsp; In this case, they are certainly not sustainable.&nbsp; See Absurd Theory #2.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schoolâ€™s leadership is full of teaparty fanatics, who consider City-owned parks to be beacons of excessively large/invasive government, and would prefer the land to be in the hands of the private sector.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone offer a somewhat less absurd theory?&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>
