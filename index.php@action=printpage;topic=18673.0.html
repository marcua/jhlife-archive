				or the employees of federal contractors who are being laid off because of the shut down and will not get back pay or even necessarily their jobs back once the shutdown is over.

Can you show any evidence that supports your belief that union membership is high among employees of federal contractors?<br /><br />It&#039;s rather insensitive to suggest racking up credit card debt to pay for life necessities is no big deal when the shut down is a result of the executive branch throwing a temper tantrum and the head of the Senate refusing to vote on bills the Senate has voted on before.
