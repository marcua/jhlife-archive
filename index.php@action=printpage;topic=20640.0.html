				I say individuals instead of men and male teens in the subject line because several of them came racing down my block recently……. of course with no helmets and no license plates and one appeared to be female. I subsequently approached two uniformed NYPD officers and inquired about this latest illegal annoyance, that has plagued our city. I was told that their orders are not to persue them. If they do, it means punishment for the officer………I believe it was vacation days taken away. Reason being if there is an accident or a biker gets injured, he/she will sue the city. I also witnessed a biker taunting two detectives in an unmarked car hoping he would be chased. The detectives did engage the biker verbally but that was it.<br />&nbsp;- What will be the policy of the new mayor, whoever it may be?<br />&nbsp;- Are there still monthly meetings at the precinct house that this topic can be discussed?<br />This lawlessness is just another example of the decline in our neighborhoods quality of life…..<br />……in my opionion.

				It&#039;s an understandable policy. Much as it would gratify me to see these knuckleheads nabbed in the act of speeding, a police pursuit could be incredibly dangerous to the general community.<br />There&#039;s also a pending City Council bill that would increase fines and incentivize reporting of where illegal dirt bikes are stored:<br /><br />https://abc7ny.com/atvs-motorcycles-dirt-bikes-illegal-street-vehicles/10889125/<br /><br />Another approach I&#039;ve been wondering about is messaging. How to appeal to the sense of pride of these guys (and they&#039;re almost all guys)--how unmanly it would be to be responsible for the injury or death of a kid or older person. How most people wonder what they&#039;re overcompensating for with their obnoxious behavior (same goes for the drag race cars).

They aren&#039;t. The only thing that might (MIGHT) change their behavior is if several of them crash and seriously injure themselves. No amount of messaging is going to change the fact that they are in their 20s or 30s and don&#039;t care that their irresponsible actions may impact someone&#039;s life other than their own.

				You&#039;re probably right about that, Clyde. Drag racing has become a nationwide scourge in the Covid era. It&#039;s a systemtic issue and calls for policy solutions.<br />Here&#039;s an interesting piece in Streetsblog, about proposed legislation to &quot;give New York City the ability to catch on camera drag racers and other reckless drivers who have been gathering overnight, thereby making it easier to enforce state laws against street racing.&quot; Crazy that speed cameras are only allowed to operate on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m!<br /><br />https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/09/17/opinion-curbing-the-scourge-of-illegal-street-racing/<br /><br />I looked up the bill on nysenate.gov and the last update was that it had been referred to the Senate rules committee in September 2020. Not sure if that means it&#039;s de facto dead.<br /><br />
