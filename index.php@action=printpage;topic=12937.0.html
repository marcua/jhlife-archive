				Here we go again.&nbsp; They presented their plan to the community board last year and then dropped their plans.&nbsp; They are hoping the Landmarks people are amenable to their plan now.&nbsp; They&#039;ll probably try and pitch it as affordable housing.&nbsp; Yeah, right.&nbsp; The fact that it will create another tall building along the narrow 37 Ave. seems not a concern.&nbsp; it&#039;s amazing they could even get this far with the fact that JH is a very congested neighborhood.&nbsp; We are already overbuilt.&nbsp; You walk down 37 Ave. or 82nd Street and it&#039;s like walking down 5th Ave. in Manhattan on a Saturday.&nbsp; Do we really need more apartments?&nbsp; The building next door is an eyesore.&nbsp; Looks like they got the plans from Architects R Us.&nbsp; It&#039;s Flushing coming to JH.&nbsp; You can hardly walk down Main St. Flushing.&nbsp; What ever happened to quality of life as an issue?&nbsp; If they cared about the neighborhood (and they probably don&#039;t) they could renovate the building for it&#039;s present business tenants and give them a reasonable lease.&nbsp; Patel would still make a profit.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Nobody likes ugly new developments in their backyard, but in actuality NYC is going to need a lot more housing in the next few decades. The population will increase to 9 million (if not more, given the census records for NYC are notoriously bad).&nbsp; Plus, the only way you can really get more affordable housing is to build A LOT more housing.<br /><br />Parking should not drive decisions about development in western Queens with good access to public transportation.<br /><br />More housing is coming to NYC...it&#039;s going to get ugly as every neighborhood goes full NIMBY to keep it out!<br /><br />As for this particular development, yeah the landlords are just looking to cash in.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what areas in this region get upzoned for more housing. Northern Blvd would seem like a prime area. The M/R train stops there are nowhere near capacity.

				This is sad news to me. The reason we were&nbsp; land marked has to do with scale. The orchestration of a planned community. Density to an already saturated neighborhood can&#039;t be good. The Infra&nbsp; structure here can barely handle the overcrowding we have now.&nbsp; You can barely walk down 37 now on a weekend. The transportation hubs are congested and sometimes dangerous due to overcrowding. I agree we need housing, but not at the cost of what we are trying to hang onto. Let them build at the site of the new proposed mall which no one needs.

				agree with everything Francis says. there&#039;s absolutely no reason to wedge development into every possible empty space. there&#039;s a reason Jackson Heights was built the way it was, with gardens, room to breathe. have times changed? to some degree, yes. but not everything has to be over developed. i personally dread the idea of adding thousands of people to the infrastructure we have now -- we&#039;re already at the point where we need people with cattle prods to shove riders into the trains at rush hour.

				Landmarking and the historic district designation will certainly make parts of Jackson Heights &quot;winners&quot; in terms of avoiding a lot of new development. Development will fill in around the historic district, as we&#039;ve already seen with new towers on Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know where all of the new NYers will go, although Corona and Flushing have steadily increased in density. There will be a lot of fighting to keep current conditions in place in many neighborhoods. Even de Blasio the vaunted liberal is very pro-development...like I mentioned before, widespread affordable housing in NYC is a fantasy unless the availability of housing is greatly increased.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying these are good trends...just being realistic in terms of what is going to happen to NYC. It&#039;s almost unimaginable, but some parts of the city (like Manhattan) are not currently very dense in a historical sense. Some neighborhoods will end up like the LES a hundred years ago.

Luxury condos get bought up, increasingly by wealthy international buyers that are parking their money and not living in NYC, and available housing stock decreases further. Everyone else crams into places farther and farther out. BdeBlasio thinks we&#039;ll fix this problem by making luxury developments include a small percentage of &quot;affordable&quot; housing, and building up places like Sunnyside Yards.&nbsp; Might help, but probably only a small dent in the problem. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to see a pied a terre tax.&nbsp; And a coordinated zoning / tax incentive effort to build more housing that doesn&#039;t cause neighborhoods to change so fast that infrastructure and public schools can&#039;t keep up.&nbsp; Probably dreaming!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Go look at the recent NY Times series. Those buildings could house so many actual New Yorkers.

				Why not just refurbish the existing space?&nbsp; Or, add just one floor?&nbsp; Why the drive to add more apartments to an already congested neighborhood?&nbsp; We&#039;re suffocating here.&nbsp; We have no real parks to speak of (that asphalt thing called Travers is not a &quot;park&quot; it&#039;s an paved over chainlink fence lot.)&nbsp; We have less parks than almost anywhere in the city.&nbsp; And they want ot build more apartments?&nbsp; All this will do is continue the precedent of adding more tall buildings along 37th.&nbsp; Just look east of 82 and you an imagine all those low buildings being replaced by tall structures with more apartments.&nbsp; If there is this craven need to build tall structures at least build them on Northern.&nbsp; They could replace the car dealerships with highrises and few would care.&nbsp; But even there it would be nice if they preserve some of the older buildings.&nbsp; The whole history of JH is about open space and light.&nbsp; That&#039;s why it was orginally created.&nbsp; We can&#039;t go back but we can at least be sensible about development for the future of our neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The need for housing does not mean we create a whole set of other problems that negatively impact on our daily lives.&nbsp; Congestion, noise, litter,&nbsp; lack of parking etc etc etc.&nbsp; I would venture to guess that prices have skyrocketed by investors who don&#039;t even live in the neighborhood. If housing is to be built it should be done humanely..... Where car deaerships exists or proposed malls are to be built and on a scale which is commensurate with&nbsp; the existing infra structure. Why would I want to endorse degrading whatever little quality of life we have here? Building at this site is BS and does not benefit any resident that lives here. I say preserve what little we have.

				The owner of the building and his team just had another presentation at the community board last week and will be going back again with revisions. The community board will hold a public hearing on the issue soon. In addition, they are required to obtain approval from the landmarks preservation committee. The landmarks preservation committee will also hold a public hearing. If you are against this development I encourage you to come to the hearings and speak up.

				I don&#039;t mean to troll but this is a very funny thread to me. It seems like the same people decrying development along the neighborhood&#039;s prime commercial street are the same ones begging for a new American bistro, or a gym, or a cheese shop, or a clothing store that sells styles from this decade. But I&#039;m not really sure where those things are going to come from without new neighbors. <br /><br />I moved into a JH co-op a little more than a year ago (indeed, very close to this proposed development) and started watching JH Life at about the same time. Since then, only one active member has put his money where is mouth is—the guy opening the Queensboro. Maybe the neighborhood needs more outside money to make it what we profess to want. I know, I know—boo gentrification. All I&#039;m saying is that there are woefully few apartments for sale in this area and some new people who are financially invested in the community might not be a bad thing. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have a car but I can commiserate with every other 7 train rider and another few dozen families aren&#039;t going to materially change the experience.&nbsp; I know that&#039;s a slippery slope argument but we&#039;re not talking about a Williamsburg-style 20 story high rise as one previous commenter lamented. <br /><br />Anyway, there&#039;s a distinct &quot;have your cake and eat it too&quot; vibe to this thread and I just wonder how the detractors square their competing desires.

				From Daniel Karatzas, author of Jackson Heights book and founding member of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group - the group behind the landmark designations:<br /><br />Hello,<br />&nbsp;<br />I believe this is the first time (other than for the annual Jackson Heights Historic Weekend) that I have used my Jackson Heights Real Estate Report database for other than real estate purposes.&nbsp; But since I imagine most of you are Jackson Heights residents, I believe the issue soon to come before Community Board 3, and then the Landmarks Preservation Commission, is worthy of your attention.&nbsp; I prepared a flyer regarding the upcoming (April 16th) Community Board 3 meeting, where the proposed four-story addition to 84-11 37th Avenue will be presented.&nbsp; While the Community Board plays an advisory role, their opinion does count.&nbsp; As such, it us up to local residents (us) to make sure that Board members are aware of our opinions, so they can make a better informed decision. <br />&nbsp;<br />I am not in favor of this proposal because it not only violates the rationale behind our being landmarked, but it will threaten the seven other one-story block fronts in the Historic District.&nbsp; It could ignite more and denser development in an already densely-built community. <br />&nbsp;<br />If you cannot attend the meeting, you can inform the Community Board of your opinion (and ask that they share it with the board members) by:<br />&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visiting them at 82-11 37th Avenue - 6th Floor<br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Calling them at 718 458 2707<br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Emailing them at&nbsp; communityboard3@nyc.rr.com<br />&nbsp;<br />The next battle is when this proposal comes before the Landmarks Preservation Commission.&nbsp; The LPC will have the ultimate say as to whether this proposal can proceed.&nbsp; Stay tuned.<br />&nbsp;<br />Daniel Karatzas<br /><br />

				84-11, while part of a landmarked area, is not in itself architecturally distinguished.&nbsp; A reasonably good design, i.e. one which is consistent with context of other buildings in area, could be an improvement over what’s there now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />A central concern with proposal seems to be that a larger building will block light and increase shadows.&nbsp; &nbsp;But further down 37th Avenue&nbsp; there are six story buildings on either side of the street, and I don’t find that to be particularly dark or oppressive.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other concern seems to be increased population density. But Jackson Heights has been a very dense urban neighborhood for many decades&nbsp; -- and rightly so given its proximity to transportation and Manhattan.&nbsp; Don’t see that some population increase, within reason, would be harmful and it could be a benefit.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Understand that the original Jackson Heights model, going back nearly a hundred years ago, was much less dense but that was from a different era and ultimately proved to be unsustainable.)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I strongly support maintaining architectural integrity of the neighborhood but I don&#039;t see this as a real threat and again, depending on design, could be an improvement. <br />

				This is what I wrote in to the community board, and it articulates my response to the previous comments on this thread:<br /><br />To the Members of Community Board 3,<br /><br />As a citizen of Jackson Heights, I am writing to you to voice my concern regarding the proposal to add four stories to the property located at 84-11 37th Avenue. One of the many reasons I love my neighborhood is for its architectural character, and I appreciate the protections imparted by the neighborhood&#039;s designation as a Historic District. My concern regarding the property in question is not only the impact the addition would have on the building itself, but, more importantly, on the precedent it would set. If additional stories are allowed to be built on this one-story corner property, it opens the floodgates for development on other similar properties within the district. Jackson Heights was landmarked not only for its architectural style, but also for its planning, scale, and sense of place. A smattering of new, taller development would be counter to the very reason this neighborhood was recognized by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in the first place.<br /><br />I urge you not to support this proposal, and ask that my comments be shared with all members of the board.<br /><br />Thank you.

				One story commercial buildings are best suited for suburban strip malls and similar roadside venues, where space is not at a premium and everyone drives.&nbsp; In an urban area, it doesn’t seem to be the best use of the property. <br /><br />Hard to think of any great cities where one story buildings are the norm. Even in low rise European cities of great beauty - Barcelona, Paris et al. -- buildings are typically at least 5 to 6 stories high, particularly on central commercial avenues. <br /><br />Here in NYC, my understanding is that most of these one story structure were built as provisional tax payers and never meant to be part of the permanent city fabric. <br /><br />At a minimum, I would hope that people fairly consider what the developer is proposing before rejecting this out of hand.&nbsp; I completely agree that a five story mediocrity (like the 90s era condos nearby on 86th street) would not be good.&nbsp; But it seems to me that the community has an opportunity to put significant pressure on the developer to do better than that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have any plans been submitted?&nbsp; <br />

				I think that what makes our neighborhood special is not any one building ( although we do have beautiful structures and housing stock) but the way in which it was planned. This is why the area was landmarks. The orchestration of low density housing as it spreads from the core which is 82 street. Building at this proposed site violates the reason why the area was land marked. It&#039;s the reason I love walking away from the Roosevelt Avenue corridor and turn down one of the side streets.&nbsp; Will we get more sanitation? More schools? More police? Better transit? We already have these problems. Building more will only add to an already saturated environment.&nbsp; The infra structure is not handling the population which is here now. If housing is needed let them build it where they intend making a mall in flushing meadows.

				I too am in favor of this development—at least, in principle. Here&#039;s why: I, like a lot of other people on JH Life want to see new restaurants, a nice bar, maybe a cheese and meat shop, and better clothing stores. But none of that is going to come without new residents who want to invest in the community. <br /><br />And lets also not lose sight of what we&#039;re talking about: The building slated for development is arguably the ugliest in a stretch of ugly ramshackle buildings. I know that if I were opening a restaurant or bar, it wouldn&#039;t be there. <br /><br />If the Landmarks Committee can force the redesign to fit into the architectural style of the neighborhood, and if the community puts pressure on the owner to find the kind of commercial tenants we all say we want, then why shouldn&#039;t we be eager about this proposal? We all love the organic market sited in the faux federalist condo (now apartment building) down the street at 84th. You couldn&#039;t do something like that in the current space. <br /><br />That&#039;s what I intend to write in my letter to the Landmarks Committee. <br /><br />I made a similar argument in an earlier thread about this proposal and ended up pretty much shutting down the conversation. That was hardly my intention and hope it doesn&#039;t happen here. Link: http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=12937.msg61988#msg61988<br /><br />

				Just spoke to Steve Kulhanek, chair of CB 3, and he confirmed what several people have said - There is no need to sign up in advance to speak at tomorrow’s public hearing on the proposed redevelopment of the landmark site at 37th Avenue and 85 Street. Just show up.<br /><br />BTW. I might have been in favor of this proposal if this was just filling in one low site in a continuos stretch of 5 and 6 story buildings on the avenue, but it is not. This will set a precedent for what will happen on seven other half-block and full-block stretches in the landmark district, including the Post Office. <br /><br />Developers will jump on those opportunities. And that will be a huge change in a historic district created to protect a NYC garden city. And while everyone wants nice stores - the 40 new apartments is not going to bring in new businesses.<br /><br />Len Maniace<br />President, Jackson Heights Beautification Group,<br />an environmental and civic organization<br />

				I am against the building as well.&nbsp; I agree it sets a dangerous precedant for further development on 37th.&nbsp; As we have seen from the building next door which has been used a reason to build this one.&nbsp; It decreases the light for both the building behind and 37th, and the neighborhood is already overcrowded, the subways as well.&nbsp; The plans for the building I saw previously were ugly and out of context with the other architecture and there was a plan for&nbsp; a large parking garage and medical offices.&nbsp; If there was going to be a YMCA built or something else that would be an asset to the community I might feel differently.
