					Captain Flannel seems to have found a great resource in the buyer&#039;s agent he used. In my experience, most agents are not that knowledgeable about the inner workings of specific buildings really--I interacted with a lot of agents when we were looking. I would think they would have no way of knowing things like which buildings had too many owners on small fixed incomes, etc. One of the challenges of coops in JH is that there are so many very small ones--the individual coops that make up the large complexes like the Chateau or Elm Court. It is easier to have a sense of the financial standing of a large coop, but how would you know anything about the small individual houses that make up these larger complexes here? As a buyer it was kind of nerve-wracking, because we were buying into a situation that having our attorney read the board minutes really did not illuminate all that much. It&#039;s just different in a very small coop. We have a handful of fellow owners here and it was only at our Board interview that we met them and by that time it was too late to turn back even if we had wanted to. <br /><br />Believe me, I am an obsessive researcher, and I found the names of everyone in this small coop in advance...but that&#039;s all I could find. I had no way of knowing their financial status or anything else about the handful of people who I now co-own the biggest investment of my life with. We just had to take a flying leap, so we did...and several years later it&#039;s working out very well. <br /><br />Anyway, if you can find a really knowledgeable buyer&#039;s agent who doesn&#039;t charge extra (beyond the realtor&#039;s split with the selling agent) and could help you negotiate--sounds like a great idea and I wish I had done it because I think we paid too much. Our seller had a very aggressive agent and she and the agent knew that we were eager to make a deal (we had sold our old apartment and had to get out) and they took full advantage of that. We did not want to rent in the interim, have to move twice, etc--so we wound up paying a price that was too high for the un-renovated state of the apartment. (Though the price was in part justified by the unusually low maintenance in this particular coop, another reason we wanted this particular apartment.)<br /><br />Another thing I wish I had done:slip flyers under every door (or put them in every entryway) in the complex we wanted to buy into. Because sometimes people are thinking of selling but haven&#039;t acted yet--and you might turn up hidden possibilities that way. When I saw that a bunch of new listings in our complex appeared not long after we bought our place, I realized that I might have turned up these other apartments had I taken the initiative and tried going door to door, something we had experienced as owners in our old place. (We got notes slipped under our door by people who wanted to buy our place if we wanted to sell.) And if we had found a place that way--it would have been a lower price because it would have been For Sale By Owner with no agent&#039;s fee involved. If I ever do this again, I will try that route if we find a particular building we want to buy in.

					Redge--what?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /> I don&#039;t understand what you are saying about the health food store and its two locations. Are you suggesting that they couldn&#039;t possibly be making enough profit to pay that rent? So something fishy is going on? Or that they are and thus the neighborhood can support more businesses like that? I generally have excellent reading comprehension and in fact make my living reading and writing about things I don&#039;t completely understand--long story--but I don&#039;t follow you in this thread at all. Yes, the rents seem extremely high and going higher. And...<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />??

					Indeed there is a brand new crepe place--but it is NOT in the former bubble tea place, which still looks the way it looked when it closed. It&#039;s on the other side of Happy Kitchen. I hope they do well, though it&#039;s kind of hard to believe that something so specific and limited could make high enough sales to support one of those storefronts. But who knows? Maybe it will do great. I was also worried about the frozen yogurt place in that regard. I&#039;d have stopped in for a crepe if I&#039;d had more time. It was nicely decorated, pleasant looking, kind of similar to Just Made 4 U in feel. Did not have time to check out the menu. Saw a little Eiffel Tower on the counter and big jars of Nutella.

					True what was just said about Roosevelt. I know the pigeon problem has been discussed for years. Personally I am unwilling to walk up Roosevelt on my way home even in the early evening. It&#039;s just so sleazy it creeps me out and I start to get really upset about the strip bars or whatever they are. We are fairly new to the neighborhood (3 years still feels like new), and once we tried a nice restaurant that had been recommended located on Roosevelt and someplace in the 60s or 50s. The place had glass walls, and while the food was good, we both felt it was kind of depressing eating dinner while gazing out at the 7 train stairs and the utter bleakness of Roosevelt Avenue. Better to not have glass walls. It&#039;s just a depressing street. We have never felt like going back there. <br /><br />Thank you to Redge for providing hard information about commercial rents. So the idea is, a lot of storefronts may be acting as fronts for the drug trade and are basically phony businesses? I had also heard that the strip is owned by one or two landlords for whom letting the stores remain vacant is fine because they can take a tax write off. So they have no incentive to make their rents more realistic. How do you fight against that? Is there any way? Community board? Business Improvement District?

					Good work! I tried Bareburger, but they are also a franchise operation and nobody replied to my &quot;We&#039;d love to hear from you please email us!&quot; email to them via their website. What is Walter&#039;s? Another yoga place? I&#039;ve never heard of it. <br /><br />Someone just told me about a really great-sounding place in Forest Hills called End of the Century--supposedly a chain also in Manhattan. A bar that makes all natural, unusual cocktails and they also serve food. I was planning on looking that up. <br /><br />Maybe I will try and reach out to people in the Pilates world, and see if anyone wants to open a little studio with Pilates machines. I used to live in Washington Heights and we had a little place there (4 or 5 machines in a small storefront) that did so well it expanded to a larger space and they now offer massage too, I believe. <br /><br />The difference is probably...the commercial rents! From what I have heard, the landlords here place the rents very high and are happy to leave the stores empty and take a tax write off while they wait for someone to come along and pay what they are asking.&nbsp; That might make a Pilates studio impossible here because it is not a highly profitable business. Anyway, like all of this, it&#039;s worth a try.

					I hope you do it here and not in Manhattan! It think it really IS an opportunity, since we have nothing like this right now. A personal plea: try not to make it too &quot;haute cuisine&quot; because I&#039;m not sure how that would work. I&#039;m thinking of a place that opened a few years ago in my old neighborhood, Washington Heights, that tried so hard to be innovative. I would have tried it, but every dish on the menu was so unusual and, to me, weird-sounding, with unlikely pairings of ingredients, that I didn&#039;t see anything that appealed to me and just never felt like going there. I like simple, classic food with fresh ingredients, cooked beautifully. Really good vegetables, really good bread. I&#039;m fairly illiterate in the language of foodies, but it&#039;s probably &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; that I am not so fond of.&nbsp; Yes? The kind of thing where the menu mentions, say, string beans, but when the dish arrives you can&#039;t even find them since they are artfully minced or pureed and hidden under the tower of mashed potatoes with the sprig of rosemary or whatever. Just my personal preference, but I think simpler is better and appeals to a wider range of customers. So that &#039;s what I would hope for, but I would definitely patronize what you are describing.

He spent years researching JH and gives an extensive historical slide show every year as part of the Garden Tour. I would think he would be a good source.

					Crabby Appleton--welcome! Pilates with machines would be GREAT and it does not need a big storefront. I currently go to Forest Hills for that. You are not an asshole, you are smart! Pilates is not just trendy, it&#039;s actually the best way to keep yourself in good physical condition in terms of strength and flexibility. Especially as you get older. (I agree about the mayonnaise.)

					Lalochezia (did I spell it right?)--that&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about! Thank you. Okay so the Spotted Pig prices are a tad higher, still we do have many places that are pretty darn pricey and seem to attract a lot of business. People act as if JH only has places that are cheap, cheap, cheap and that&#039;s all it can support. Not true. I do love the fact that my husband and I can have a really great Thai meal at Cafe 79 at an amazingly thrifty price, at Thakali Kitchen as well—2 of our faves—but one can also spend a LOT more money on dinner right here on 37th Avenue. At places that are doing great business.

					Redge: this is GREAT news! I am also one of your first customers. We have been organizing a group to see what we can do to attract some more varied dining options to JH, which many of us believe definitely can support more restaurants that are not the ubiquitous formica tables, plastic trays, fluorescent lighting, Coke machine and wall-mounted TV places. Those are great to have, too, but there are lots of people in JH who would love to have a nice place for drinks, more sit-down dining options including American/European/Italian, a nice bistro, even a good burger place or pub that was not a sports bar. I and others have pointed out that some of the South American restaurants already here seem to be always packed and are NOT cheap at all. Why wouldn&#039;t some of those customers also support other options?&nbsp; There is stereotype that this is a neighborhood for poor immigrants and yes, maybe there are a few more affluent people here, but basically this is a cheap food only neighborhood because that&#039;s all the neighborhood can support. I disagree. I think (as many have also pointed out) that the main issue preventing JH from having more/better retail and dining options is very high commercial rents, higher than in Bed-Stuy or wherever. Not sure why that is the case. The people who seem to want the neighborhood to remain frozen in time and think everyone should shut up and just leave the neighborhood if they want a good gym or a bistro meal--well, I just totally disagree with that notion.

					All very good points, Palermo, but I want to note that people over 65 are not necessarily eating beans at home every night. They may be receiving Social Security and small pensions, and thus be on a &quot;fixed income,&quot; but that does not mean they don&#039;t have substantial assets as well.&nbsp; They do go out to eat, they do travel, etc. From what I&#039;ve observed, many older people who may have had modest jobs/salaries their whole lives have saved and are very comfortable financially, having benefited from the post-WW II boom times. They may have more generous pension benefits, including healthcare benefits, than younger people will ever get, they may have accumulated wealth from the big run up in real estate and stock prices. I know retired people who worked in public education their whole lives who own city apartments they bought for peanuts that are now worth millions, as well as summer homes they bought at the right time, etc. <br /><br />And I think the effort is to attract better chains, in fact, not necessarily the lone entrepreneur. The latter would be great but not as realistic. I don&#039;t see why the better chains wouldn&#039;t want to come in here, as some have to surrounding Queens neighborhoods.

					Pipman-- I just made a similar comment on the &quot;Why do you leave the neighborhood&quot; thread here. Yes, there are lots of folks spending very good money at the restaurants you just mentioned. And those same people would likely patronize one of the better chains like Bareburger or Five Napkins or whatever.&nbsp; And they would join a bigger, nicer gym. The group that is trying to influence better retail to go into the Bruson Building uncovered the sales materials the real estate agents are using to lure possible tenants. It lists population and median income figures for JH, and has a map showing that we have Duane Reade, RiteAid, Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts, Subway, Burger King, McDonalds...if I am remembering correctly, that&#039;s what the map shows, I guess because that&#039;s what the realtors are trying to attract. I did not notice Arunee or E77 or Cafe 79 or any of the other nicer restaurants on that map.
