				I can’t speak for anyone else, but loading this app has caused me nothing but anxiety and grief!&nbsp; The frequency of Incidents, and the constant chatter is unnerving!&nbsp; <br />Many if not most 911 calls seem to be focused near Roosevelt Ave, in the very early morning.&nbsp; This is still problematic- I am uncomfortable living so near to so many violent incidents.&nbsp; <br />I am curious to hear what other people think.&nbsp; <br />(For the record I am Left of Bernie &amp; AOC)

				This app is very intrusive and raises serious privacy concerns. I uninstalled it immediately and use the website instead. While the website may also be trying to steal your personal data, at least you can erase your browser cookies and change your privacy settings to limit this somewhat. Naturally they make the website difficult to use, but I find the effort useful when I can&#039;t find out what&#039;s going on any other way.

				Citizen hasn&#039;t created more crime, it&#039;s just showing you a little taste of what has always been there. I wouldn&#039;t worry; in fact I don&#039;t feel unsafe at all. Just do what you&#039;ve always done... Keep your wits about you. And delete the app.

				A small excerpt from this very good criticism of Citizen:<br />https://www.phillymag.com/news/2020/02/24/citizen-app-philadelphia/<br /><br /><em>&quot;Another concern: The constant crime notifications coming in through Citizen have the potential to shape users’ psychology, says Temple criminal justice professor Ajima Olaghere. Maybe someone watches a series of crime-scene videos in a neighborhood with boarded-up homes. There’s nothing criminal about boarded-up homes, but now an association has been made. In facilitating this, the app “reinforces perceptions of people’s ideas of crime and fear.” These “notions of ‘disorder,&#039;” she adds, “stoke fear in people and often translate to a 911 call” even when nothing criminal is going on.<br /><br />Citizen can also shift the perspective of longtime residents. Lynn Rinaldi, who has lived in Girard Estates for 20 years, never used to worry about coming home late at night after work at Paradiso, the East Passyunk restaurant she used to own. But she recently downloaded Citizen, and seeing all the crime notifications “created a little bit of anxiety for me,” she says. “I started to say, I’m not going to take my car out after dark; I’ll just Uber if have to go somewhere.” Though she decided to stop checking the app, it’s easy to imagine how Citizen could produce a self-perpetuating cycle in someone else: A user downloads Citizen and becomes more anxious about crime; the person becomes hyper-vigilant and starts calling 911 when something “suspicious” goes on; that, in turn, generates new Citizen notifications, which ultimately makes everyone else using the app more paranoid, too.&quot;</em>

There are too many taxi bars (fronts for prostitution), illegal bars, and simply bars that attract a particularly seedy clientele. People have been complaining about the situation on Roosevelt for years and it is rare that any thing gets done (the last thing in my recent memory is when they cracked down on the dudes handing out the chica cards many years ago. Of course, they did nothing to actually address the larger problem). The Queens County Sheriff could probably make a sweep of the entire avenue from 74th to 110th on liquor license violations alone.

Those are objectively much safer neighborhoods and they don&#039;t have a tenth of the problems that we have here. Source: I have family in Girard Estates and I&#039;m there at least every two months for a couple of days. I walk to East Passyunk for the restaurants or to go to the BOK Building. There is a problem with heroin addicts congregating on Snyder and Broad (the mid point between the two neighborhoods), but the City has actually been doing something to address that issue. I have never felt unsafe there late at night (after 11:00PM), but I have felt unsafe on Roosevelt.

				this stuff has always been occurring in our neighborhood AFAICT.<br />The neighborhood is pretty safe. Just pay attention to your surroundings, avoid known problem areas after dark, and you&#039;ll be fine. Jackson Heights is a great safe neighborhood, and 99% of the community members behave like yourself. <br />The app is just making you aware of random little incidents you never would have been aware of previously.

				<br />I deleted the App a few years ago, even when I was @ work in midtown, the notifications, were often too disturbing/distracting,&nbsp; and simply not good for mental health !<br /><br />&quot;The constant crime notifications coming in through Citizen have the potential to shape users psychology&quot;, says Temple criminal justice professor Ajima Olaghere.<br />
