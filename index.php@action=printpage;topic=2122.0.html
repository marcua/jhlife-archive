				For the second time in the last few months I saw a Red Tailed Hawk in the Hawthorne Court garden.&nbsp; This time it was plucking and eating some unlucky bird.&nbsp; The squirrels were all in the trees frozen like statues.&nbsp; Another resident said he has seen the hawk a few times.&nbsp; I went online and learned that there is a nest on the Triborough Bridge and one in Flushing Meadows Park.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen the hawk in our neighborhood?

				I saw him (or her) chowing down on a pigeon on 75th St. near 37th Ave. on Thanaksgiving Day. I guess even hawks have a bird for thier T-Giving&nbsp; : ) <br /><br />When I worked in Flushing meadows I came across the hawks pretty regularly. One morning there were 4 of them standing in a circle around another one who was clamped down on a pigeon. I turned and walked the other way as I didn&#039;t want to get caught in the middle of a hawk fight :)

				We could use one of those hawks around Roosevelt Terrace (86th and 35th). <br /><br />Lately, I see a flock of pigeons flying around like they were from a coop. Anyone know of anyone around here with a pigeon coop??

				A few weeks ago I saw a red-tailed hawk land on the fire escape on the tallest apt. building facing west on 74th St between Roosevelt and 37th ave.&nbsp; It seemed to be checking out the spot behind the building where someone throws food out of their windows for the pigeons (and rats...I&#039;ve seen them running around in the snow).&nbsp; Too bad it didn&#039;t wait around longer!<br /><br />This site is really awesome if you are interested in raptors in NYC:<br /><br />http://urbanhawks.blogs.com/ (http://urbanhawks.blogs.com/)<br /><br />There is way more wildlife within the city than people realize.&nbsp; Even wild turkeys in Central Park!

				That is a nice photo!&nbsp; But I&#039;m pretty sure that is a red-tailed hawk...looks like the one I saw a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Immature red-tails especially have that light speckled color as in the photo.<br /><br />Peregrine falcons have a very well-defined &quot;mask&quot; around their eyes, and much more pointed tail and wings associated with their high speed flight.&nbsp; There are definitely peregrines breeding in NYC, but I think most of them migrate south for the winter (although perhaps not all?).&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;m a bit of a bird nerd!

				While we&#039;re on the subject, I was in Woodhaven last week and was delighted to witness a flock of parrots caterwauling through the air. Apparently the famous Brooklyn flock (http://www.brooklynparrots.com/) is beginning to venture north. Maybe they&#039;ll reach JH sometime soon!&nbsp; :D

				I guess Scrabble is ok.&nbsp; After Scrabble finished its meal the other day he/she was hanging out in a tree when another bird started to harass the hawk.&nbsp; The smaller bird swooped close a few times and let out a loud screech.&nbsp; Scrabble didn&#039;t budge, but it was interesting to see the interaction.

				Scrabble the hawk was in a tree in my backyard.&nbsp; I watched it until it finally flew away.&nbsp; Once it was gone a squirrel that was sitting frozen in the same tree let out a series of high-pitched chirps.&nbsp; I have read that prairie dogs and similar animals have lookouts that signal the arrival and departure of predators so that the colony knows when to take cover and when it is all clear.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know NYC squirrels had the same capacity.&nbsp; Maybe it was just a chirp of relief.

				Yep, that&#039;s the bird I saw Saturday afternoon when I was gardening over at St. Mark&#039;s. He was<br />in a &#039;borrowed&#039; nest consuming the contents for quite a while.<br />The nest where I saw him is in the sycamore tree on the corner of 81st St and 34th Ave just <br />by the Q32 bus stop.<br /><br />I say borrowed because it didn&#039;t look big enough for him/her and the doves and pigeons<br />were having a fit.

				The bird in TBM&#039;s latest picture looks like a Cooper&#039;s hawk.&nbsp; Did it have a long, straight tail with a rounded end?&nbsp; They are very maneuverable and fast as an adaptation for flying through forested areas and picking off birds.&nbsp; Lots of great sightings in the neighborhood!&nbsp; Who says we need park land?! <br /><br />If you have a little dog then you better watch the skies!

				I think most geese around NYC &amp; Long Island stopped migrating south about 20-30 years ago.&nbsp; The milder winters and plenty of food were enough to keep them here and they have no natural predator.&nbsp; Golf courses and farmers on the North and South Forks are struggling with ways to keep them away and their populations are growing.<br /><br />NYC Peromyscus - was this morning&#039;s sighting a Cooper&#039;s Hawk?

				Great picture TBM!&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure that is a Cooper&#039;s hawk...that long, straight tail is a good diagnostic character.&nbsp; The red-tails have a kind of a wide, stubby tail.&nbsp; I wish I could see this guy down my way in the low 70&#039;s, but alas, we have almost no trees!

				Up here in Northridge , 90th between Northern &amp; 32nd Ave., we&#039;ve been seeing a couple of hawks, on and off for the past few years. Today, I saw one sitting very low, going from tree to tree, between our buildings and 90th Street Park. You could tell it was hunting. I&#039;m surprised we don&#039;t have more considering the number of squirrels we now have. It was beautiful to watch.

				The Astoria Park hawk pair are named Atlas and Athena. Hank disappeared in summer 2008 and was never seen again. It takes 3 years for a Red-Tailed Hawk (or RTH) to develop the full red tail and to reach sexual maturity. The bird you seen in Jackson Heights could be from anywhere (including Pale Male&#039;s offspring), there is a pair on the Unisphere in Flushing Meadow, on the Courthouse on Queens Blvd. in Briarwood, in the Woodside Housing Projects off Northern Blvd., in Cunningham Park in Jamaica Estates, etc. There is believed to be at least 30 mating pairs in the city at any given time. <br /><br />A few more good websites to use as reference:<br /><br />http://www.fotoportmann.com/birdblog/category/new-york-city/<br /><br />www.queensraptors.blogspot.com<br /><br />http://www.citybirder.blogspot.com/<br /><br />http://yojimbot.blogspot.com/<br /><br />http://www.palemaleirregulars.blogspot.com/<br /><br />http://www.palemale.com/<br /><br />

				NYC RTH&#039;s that have established nesting areas normally don&#039;t bother migrating as the number of buildings they can use as shelter plus a constant food supply that does not migrate keeps them in the city all year. The Cooper&#039;s Hawks you see in the city now are MOSTLY younger birds from up north, it is widely believed there are not any Cooper&#039;s nests in NYC.

				We saw one at Juniper Park about a month ago on a Saturday when we went sleding.&nbsp; The park was full of people, full of snow and a Hawk graced us with his presence.&nbsp; He was looking at all the kids and families having fun.&nbsp; I think he is the one that lives in the cementery by the Kmart mall.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen the hawk in Flushing and I look, and look, I have seen Lola and Pale male almost every time I go to Central park.&nbsp; I even saw one on 86th and Riverside Park.&nbsp; <br /><br />Scrabble is a buddy of mine I have see him often.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first time I saw him was 4 years ago when I had my son sitting in the toddler swing section in Travers Park.&nbsp; He swooped from tree to tree not to high above us.&nbsp; I could feel the weight of air his huge wings made as he flew overhead and the sound was like in the movies, like a dragon flying.&nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; We always look for him at the park.<br /><br />I have even seen him from the #7 platform on 82nd street.&nbsp; Just look high up and if you see pigeons scattering to the four winds, it is because they spotted a hawk.

				seen a bunch over the years, though none so far this winter. my ex and i used to own a house on 75th street that had a semi-enclosed top floor roof porch area, and hawks/falcons would use it as a perch area to get a bead on prey. beautiful, but cleaning up squirrel parts was a little gross sometimes&nbsp; &nbsp;:P
