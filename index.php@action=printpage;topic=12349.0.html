				I know is clearly stated in the coop house rule, but some unit I saw have one of those brand new washer and dryer all in one, no venting needed. Few agents told me that you can get away by swapping out dishwasher and place it with those washer and dryer too. One said you can do that for expecting mom. Anyone ever successfully able to put these machine in?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Doing any kind of plumbing work in a condo or a co-op can really screw your neighbors up. My downstairs neighbor did some unlicensed work on their apartment and they ending up capping one of the water lines. I lived without hot water in my shower for months until it was discovered. And doing it on the sly is grounds (and deserving of) a big fine and order to remove the appliance.<br /><br />You really need to speak to the property manager of your building before you attempt anything. If it can be done and/or it&#039;s allowable, they&#039;ll tell you.&nbsp; Many buildings do not allow washers in units because they use more water than dishwashers, and there are new laws re backwashes that buildings have to comply with. <br /><br />Your real estate agent should not be telling you what you can get away if unless they also tell you you need to get permission from the Board of your building. Just because someone puts something into they&#039;re apartment doesn&#039;t mean it belongs there. Perhaps it&#039;s allowable, in which case, everyone will be happy.&nbsp; Living in a co-op means you have to co-operate.

				Thanks, some of those listings we saw actually put down washer and dryer on their listing, I assume that is legal in those coop. We always ask the agents what the situations is with the coop rule, so not sure if some of them just make it up that is is possible.

				For your own protection, do not assume that what the agent tells you is necessarily true.&nbsp; A lot of agents will tell you anything to hook a sale.&nbsp; (certainly not all agents are dishonest or willing to stretch the truth, but I&#039;ve met more than a few).&nbsp; and as I said, the presence of a machine doesn&#039;t mean it really belongs there.&nbsp; People just get away with it or did it years ago before the Board was paying attention,<br /><br />If it is so important that you need to install a washing wachine and it will make a difference as to whether you would make a bid, I would insist that the realtor speak to the property agent before intitiating a contract and get you an answer whether you can install a machine.<br /><br />And those apartment washer/dryers without venting aren&#039;t that great.&nbsp; To get one that&#039;s worthwhile you need to buy top of the line and because they don&#039;t really &quot;dry&quot; (they beat the moisture out of the clothese by rotation) it can take hours to dry a single load. I live in a co-op with lots of children, there are busy times to use the machines but there are also not busy times were the machines are free.&nbsp; &nbsp;I honestly wouldn&#039;t get one of these machine to wash a lot of children&#039;s clothes, your electric bill will go throught the roof.&nbsp; and the clothese aren&#039;t soft like heat dried clothese, they are &quot;crunchy&quot; and would need to be shook out and/or pressed.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t assume that just because they put down a washer/dryer in the listing that the owners are in compliance with the coop board.&nbsp; I bought my apt with a washer/dryer already in the unit - neither were hooked up but they were included in the sale.&nbsp; The seller&#039;s agent attested that they were allowed in the apts.&nbsp; Much to my surprise, I was then told by the board at interview that they are not allowed because the old pre-war pipes can&#039;t sustain the load.&nbsp; Those machines got thrown out (thankfully they were pretty old machines and in hindsight, the lack of hookup should&#039;ve been a clue that something was not right).&nbsp; We were fooled.

				Take look at the laundry room in the building you&#039;re interested in, speak to some of the people using the machines and ask them their opinion of availabilty and reliability of the machines.<br /><br />We have excellent machines in my buidling and as long as I don&#039;t insist on doing laundry on a Saturday afternoon, I have absolutely no problem. the machine are HE and industrial grade, they clean awesomely.

				&nbsp;We did take out an old dishwasher and put in this washer/dryer combo which is very popular in European countries. The<br />point about using them for kids clothes is true as they don&#039;t really dry but sortof steam dry the clothes. Mostly you have<br />to put things on a drying rack to go the last bit to fully dry. Not good at all with towels and larger sheets but very handy<br />for people that might do a small load a day or every other. Gym clothes and lingerie are fine but most of us where more<br />than that! They only use 5 gallons of way BTW which may be less than many dishwashers.<br />

				Thanks everyone! I am used to going to laundromat, but spouse from midwest not use to it. I figure is something nice to have.<br /><br />@Taggie to swap the dishwasher with washer/dryer combo do you need to approve by board or you just order it from the store and have them install it.<br /><br />Thanks!

				If you live in a co-op, there are written Rules which will tell you whether you can install something that feeds into the plumbing line. You should take a look at them and/or speak to the Property Manager. Every building is different in terms of their policies on washers (dish and clothing) but if you do something that&#039;s against the rules in yours, you will get fined. You will have to pay the fine or you will not be able to sell your apartment when you want to move.&nbsp; The simplest solution is to just look in the rules and if it&#039;s still not clear, speak to the property manager.&nbsp; &nbsp;It may be perfectly fine&nbsp; and no problem at all, but you need to be sure it&#039;s OK.&nbsp; And as I mentioned there are issues re backwash regulations which may impact your building today, even if you know people who currently have&nbsp; machines in the building (those machines may be grandfathered) or in other buildings.&nbsp; Just ask or look in the Rules , then you will know.

				when you attach a washer to the plumbing line (even a small one), you are not just turning water on INTO your apartment, you are also releasing waste back into the plumbing line (hence backwash regulations) . The building has to comply with strict DEP regulations as to what can be released back into the sewer system. So don&#039;t just think of it as a air conditioner or a refrigerator. It&#039;s not just your apartment that&#039;s effected by a washing machine (dish or clothes) it&#039;s the balance of the entire building. It may be OK, no big deal, but you need to find out what the building allows for the sake of the building.

				&nbsp;There was no issue with putting in one of the European style washer/dryers in our coop. They use very little water and I <br />think it is the same as a dishwasher which it replaced in our apt in terms of dirty water going out. It was very convenient<br />but we actually missed the occasional camaraderie with our neighbors that can take place in the laundry room. Also this<br />dryer cannot really fully dry or take large items.

				Nice, so the term &quot;co-operative&quot; means nothing then, just do what you want regardless of house rules. So when my downstairs neighbor capped the hot water leading into MY apartment (to do something, god knows why this happened, he probably had a washing machine hooked up and however set it up did it incorrectly)) and I lived without hot water in my shower for three months because the neighbor below didn&#039;t want to be found out, it&#039;s OK because you say do what you want. Oh did I mention that the Management was convinced it was me, because i had just moved in? Except I followed the rules.<br /><br />You should not serve on any boards ever again. What an irresponsible suggestion!!!

				I agree with most of the posters: if w/d is important to your happiness ensure with the co op board that it is allowed.<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree about the unvented combo units. I had one in my co op apartment in Brooklyn and it was awesome. My co op in JH does not allow in unit w/d. We have a beautiful recently renovated laundry room -- and while convenient it is not the same as having my old in-unit combo w/d (top of the line LG).<br /><br />Neighbors who misuse bleach in the wrong drawer have ruined two loads of my new sheets and towels.<br /><br />Cost of doing laundry in a community environment I guess.<br /><br />So frustrating!<br /><br />I miss my old w/d. A ventless unit. Sure, it took 4 hours to dry. But it was quiet. I would put in a load at bedtime and it was done the next day. No inadvertent bleach stains due to neighbors who didn&#039;t read instructions.<br /><br />There are JH co ops that allow in-unit w/d. The Berkeley is one. Linden Court is another. If it&#039;s important, keep looking. You will find the right place.

				My understanding is that the elevator buildings generally do not allow in-apartment washer/dryers. Some of them are coming around--I know of at least one Hawthorne which now permits it. <br /><br />Walk ups like the Greystones and Hampton do permit them in at least some of their buildings, based on units I&#039;ve seen.

				Sorry, lalochezia!<br /><br />I am confusing The Berkelely with the Belvedere. (We did a whirlwind tour of open houses before making the offer on our apartment and saw like 15 homes in a weekend!)<br /><br />I actually loved the Belvedere -- truly gracious floor plans, nice neighbors and an awesome party room/community space if I remember right. It was the electric-only stove that was my stumbling block there, if I recall. <br /><br />But I know that I saw a unit with an in-apt. w/d. <br /><br />At Linden Ct. also. I remember that for a fact! We argued w/d over walk up. :-) I did not win.
