				When I was growing up in Montclair Gardens in the 1940s and 50s, Jackson Heights didnâ€™t sound like it does today.&nbsp; In the winter, you awoke to the jingle tire chains. . . and if it had snowed that night you knew it immediately thanks to the rhythmic scrape of shovels in the muffled air.&nbsp; <br /><br />Spring arrived with the racket of roller skates and cap pistols.&nbsp; Coal rattled on steel coal chutes, laundry flapped on the roofs, the Good Humor man rang his bicycle bells, and street singers performed under our windows for small change wrapped in pieces of paper.&nbsp; There was even an organ-grinder. <br /><br />Summer days were punctuated by the bang of illegal fireworks, the clatter of cards on bicycle spokes, and the â€œpockâ€ of a broomstick hitting a pink â€œSpauldeen.â€ <br /><br />I am old enough to remember the clip clop of the ragmanâ€™s horse and his cry of â€œBuy old clothes!â€ A man with a portable grindstone sharpened scissors and knives with a shrill shower of sparks.&nbsp; Milk men and Seltzer men clinked and rattled on their appointed rounds. <br /><br />Walk down any street back then and the sound of the World Series or a political convention poured from open windows and followed you from block to block. By the late 50s, the chorus of radios and TVs had been replaced by the ubiquitous hum of the air conditioner.<br /><br />I still remember the percussion of womenâ€™s high heels late at night outside my window.&nbsp; It was just like I heard on The Shadow and The Green Hornet, mysterious and suspenseful, except it was real.&nbsp; <br /><br />And then there was the day I heard the drone of&nbsp; bombers over P.S. 69.&nbsp; I looked up and saw hundreds of war planes flying in formation and bound for some government junkyard far from the neighborhood.&nbsp; Even on this sad last mission the planes looked mighty. They had changed the world and, as I would learn in later life, the world they changed included Jackson Heights.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Nagelberg, I find your post fascinating!&nbsp; Believe it or not, it reminds me somewhat of my early years in the Bronx.&nbsp; While I grew up during a much later era, it appears as if things such as the laundry flapping, the Good Humor man, bike bells, spauldeens, etc. were once ubiquitous throughout New York&#039;s inner cities.<br /><br />I would definitely enjoy reading more of your posts describing the Jackson Heights of your youth.&nbsp; Some photos, if any, would also be great to see!

				That was really cool Nagelberg.<br /><br />My memories of the neighborhood are somewhat later, but I do recall sounds you don&#039;t hear anymore.&nbsp; Like the knife grinding truck that would go down the street, and all the kids would be send out with the knives from mom and dad to have them sharpened.<br /><br />And the trains were louder, or maybe there was less noise to cover them up?&nbsp; Planes seemed louder too, but that could be memorie sof laying on the bike field on 82nd and Astoria watching them whoosh overhead.<br /><br />
