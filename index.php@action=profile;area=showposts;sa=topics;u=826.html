					Good morning, <br />Basically we&#039;re trying to separate our marriage, which is amicable- but our place is getting too small. <br />If we became known as the neighborhood house-sitters, like some folks are cat-sitters that might be ideal as we plan. <br />Would like one of us to have a place to crash and spend some hours away from our home in order to keep it amicable. <br /><br />JH/Elmhurst is key, as we co-parent in just about every way. <br />We are tidy, responsible, and quiet, and as noted, just need some space. <br />Thanks for any leads.

					<br />Reposted from JH Families. Map won&#039;t load, it can be found on fb- Jackson Heights 11372 or Make Queens Safer. <br />I have to say, I am a pedestrian and bike advocate in the community, and often when attending community board meetings, people have never heard such language as &quot;ditch your car&quot; but it&#039;s a pretty popular idea I thought I&#039;d share. (check out @waroncars podcast)<br /><br />Sorry folks, we have a crisis in Jackson Heights of PEDESTRIANS getting killed by reckless drivers- and reducing the number of cars has got to happen. This is a quaint little neighborhood, council districts are about 160,000 people...and driving is not an entitlement, it&#039;s a privilege- and let&#039;s hope people can see the sense in cutting down some of the unnecessary trips. It&#039;d be great too if people could retrain their brains to walk short distances, whether it&#039;s farther out for parking, unloading and carting your supplies a block or two, putting your kids in local schools or taking mass transit. <br /><br />Also, there is a very good chance congestion pricing will pass in Albany this term- that will open up many more channels for better mass transit and bike/pedestrian infrastructure. <br /><br />Now, to pull back from that statement- please look at your driving habits differently. Are you speeding up to catch a yellow light, turn a corner, grab a spot? Do you gun the vehicle after being stuck behind a double parker, not looking a block ahead to the crosswalk? Do you block bike lanes, forcing cyclists into oncoming traffic? Do you allow proper &quot;due care&quot; to be able to maintain control, if some surprise like a mom stopping in a crosswalk to pick up a dropped shoe, an old lady not quite making it before the light changes? <br /><br />For once, just think about the number of times individual drivers circle a neighborhood trying to park- park for weeks on end, or park to run in a shop, or double park to pick someone up, or park in crosswalks, or corners that block the view for those of us on foot- who deserve to not be terrorized by reckless driving. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say 14 is the number of people who&#039;ve been killed walking in our neighborhood in the last 5 years. <br />(a map is included) That&#039;s horrendous. <br />The three fatalities in just 7 blocks on 37th happened like this-<br />Driver reversed into SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE in crosswalk at 74th<br />Driver mounted sidewalk, killing SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE&nbsp; at 78th <br />Driver drove directly into SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE in crosswalk and ran her over 2 times on 81st. <br /><br />Each of us have horror stories of near misses and so many of us know SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE whose had an injury, sometimes life changing, definitely costly and kept them out of work. <br /><br />We&#039;ve had DOT redesign streets, JH Historic District implemented a neighborhood slow zone, Lead Pedestrian Intervals, changes to signal timing, and even a pedestrian safety forum back in around 2014. <br /><br />My family rents cars at LaGuardia when we need them- mainly to promptly leave town. We&#039;re able to return the car directly afterward so as not to contribute to the ridiculous circling around and being reckless in every way. Oh, U-Turns too- How long till someone dies from a U-Turning driver mounting the sidewalk, crashing into a storefront? <br /><br />Many neighbors have expressed outrage, shame and fear over this most recent fatality- hopefully this will mobilize folks to go to precinct council meetings and urge elected&#039;s to seek out new resources...enforcement is key for me- every driver ticketed, repeatedly and with increasing penalties and vehicle confiscation, as the poor ebike riders tolerate. <br /><br />Our community has suffered from a crisis of preventable deaths. It&#039;s a symptom of having too many cars on the roads. Sure, there are reckless drivers and unlicensed drivers, and yes- you&#039;ll blame the pedestrians- but as a pedestrian and cyclist, like many of us in the neighborhood- we see traffic differently. <br />Commissioner Trottenberg of DOT has said, &quot;If you&#039;re in traffic, you are traffic&quot; <br /><br />Every day in our neighborhood, thousands of parents and caregivers are lugging baby strollers up subway stairs, through cumbersome doorways, soon through daunting snowbanks. They are stopped practically every block to wait for the light- they are your equals- residents of a community that can&#039;t afford another tragic and preventable death. <br /><br />Please look at your driving habits differently- even if you&#039;ve never killed or injured anyone. <br />

					Short on time, but I witnessed three giant dumpster trucks barreling down 41st Ave towards Baxter and the Target site. I&#039;ve also noticed that that construction has commandeered parts of two parks, Manuel de Unaue, and Donningham Triangle. <br /><br />41st is a good road, from Broadway to Baxter, BUT- DOT has already tried to fix it from past fatalities and serious injuries. <br />It is also the community entrance to Elmhurst Hospital clinics, specialty outpatient care and many programs. <br />It&#039;s unacceptable to have this project put our lives at risk. <br />I sent a letter to hospital, Dromm, Cruz, CB4 and DOT...<br />What can we do? Here&#039;s the quick note-<br />Good afternoon all, <br />I’ve just come from the community entrance to Elmhurst at 41st Ave. As a low income New Yorker, I use Elmhurst for my healthcare, and am proud of the care I get. <br />As I was unlocking my bike, a woman yelled at a truck- ‘“They shouldn’t be here…” <br />Three very large construction dumpster trucks passed by in a few minutes, surely enroute to the jobsite of what’s called the Target construction. <br /><br />If this is the noted traffic plan for the next few years of construction, we’re in danger. The trucks are going from Broadway down 41st to Baxter. Then they block traffic, possibly using Manuel de Unaue- triangle as a staging area. <br />Is Parks aware of that? It’s fenced off. <br /><br />Anyway- DOT has done significant work on Elmhurst Hospital, both the Broadway side and 41st. But more needs to be done. Cars routinely fail to stop at 80th, and the messy merge with eastbound traffic is collision in the works. <br />As a matter of fact, the woman I spoke to noted that her friend was struck there about a year ago and died from her injuries. <br /><br />To recap- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41st needs more traffic safety and mitigation- a blinking red 3 way stop light might be helpful. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction site at 82nd/Baxter is bringing trucks on non-truck route 41st, outside the community entrance, and it’s going to cause a serious crash. <br /><br />Please let me know that this will be reviewed and investigated to mitigate any tragedies.

How the hell does one do it in NYC with kids, and high rents? <br /><br />So, looking for the simplest studio or sublet that can allow us space apart while not inconveniencing our kid too much. This is not an angry separation, so if either of us could swap chores, errands or other responsibilities to keep the cost down, that would be appreciated. Thanks for any leads. DM me please.

Bring your old bike and possibly trade it for a better fitting one. <br />There will be plenty of activities and giveaways. <br />To register for the kids Learn to Ride (ages 5-14 w/own bike) scroll down this link to the Elmhurst Frank O&#039;Conner event, and click &quot;sign up&quot; <a href="https://www.bike.nyc/education/programs/learn-to-ride-kids/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.bike.nyc/education/programs/learn-to-ride-kids/</a><br />Additionally, we will have a bike rodeo- kids who do ride are welcome to participate in a series of bike skills gamies to learn better riding practices. <br />I&#039;m really pleased to bring biking and bike safety education to the neighborhoods of Queens. <br /><br />There&#039;s no better thrill than to lead rides, and bike commute and notice every day that more and more people of all variety are enjoying our streets, getting healthy and saving money and time on transportation. Biking if for you and your family. To that end, DOT has translated the event into 7 languages for me. Love it!! Please share and come by!! <br />It&#039;s a joint effort of DOT, Recycle-a-Bicycle, BikeNY, Jackson Heights Beautification Group, NY Coalition for Traffic Safety, Transportation Alternatives, NYPD 110 Precinct, and Elmhurst Hospital<br />

					Hi. <br />I&#039;m organizing a 2nd Annual Jazz tour of Corona and uncovering more and more. <br />If anyone is interested in scouting the route- or sharing Jazz in Corona stories- please let me know. <br /><br />(by the way- the old timers like to call it all Corona! East Elmhurst is sometimes acceptable. Anyway, North east of here has quite a storied Jazz past)

					ACTION ALERT! In the last 6 years, District 30 schools along Northern Boulevard have suffered child fatalities due to reckless drivers in every form. I&#039;m working with DOT Safety Education to try to improve their programs and also the number of schools who DOT visits. Please, if your childs school or your PTA have seen a DOT presentation, please let me know. They think they are doing a good job, but as long as children and parents have to beg an elected official to try for years to get a stop sign- they are not doing a good job. And, PS. 152, IS230, IS 145, IS 227 are schools where kids have been killed right outside their doors. In the future, DOT has promised me they will pilot new programs and outreach in District 30 and District 24. But, I need your help now. It&#039;s about speed cameras. Right now, there are only 140 in the whole city and they only operate when school is in session. The Vision Zero Youth Council will be hosting a rally outside Governor Cuomo&#039;s Manhattan office on June 7th. (Chancellor&#039;s Day, no school for kids) VZYC was founded by a group of kids who lost friends in traffic violence in Brooklyn. My group, Make Queens Safer will help get Queens kids to this rally. We aim to fill two busses. The bussing will be free for all students. <strong>If your children, your PTA, your class, if you&#039;re a teacher, if anyone may be interested please let me know. You can email <a href="mailto:makequeenssafer@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">makequeenssafer@gmail.com</a>. </strong>Here is the info from VZYC-<br />Speed safety cameras are one of the most effective tools we have to reduce speeding in New York City, and right now we are limited to only 140 of them for our 2,000+ schools. Speed safety cameras reduce speeding by over 60 percent where they&#039;ve been implemented, and are proven to save lives. Right now, there is a bill to more than double the number of speed safety cameras that can be implemented to protect NYC kids. However, for this bill to become a law we need political leadership in Albany.<br />More background here.<br />The broad details of the rally (6/7):<br />What: Children United Rally Against Speeding (CURBS)<br />Who: Vision Zero Youth Council, Hundreds of Public School Students from All Five Boroughs, Elected Officials<br />When: Thursday, June 7th, 11am <br />Where: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s Office, 633 Third Ave (between 40th and 41st)<br />Thank you for your help. Until the city decides to make Vision Zero for Schools and adds someone to oversee school traffic safety, we will have to keep advocating. We can&#039;t lose another dear child or have another school community in grief counseling because they&#039;ve lost a friend.

No queremos sacrificar los niños sin representando nuestro familias. Lo siento, si este es confundo. Estoy solamente con caridad por este comunidad.

					Make queens Safer, Families for Safe Streets and Transportation Alternatives Queens Committee are the sponsors. <br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/198814540732125/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/events/198814540732125/</a><br /><br />Giovanni was the 5th kid killed on Northern Blvd in 6 years. Also in the last year, a senior man and a 90 year old woman- yes on Northern alone. <br /><br />Giovanni was killed mere blocks from where the Mayor came in 2014 to announce Vision Zero. You can see the flags wave at that school, PS 152 and also IS 145, where Miguel Torres was killed. It&#039;s too much. It hurts. The family is devastated. <br /><br />Both the mom and dad as well as the grandmother and brothers all wish for us to have this vigil and rally. <br />We want to support the family. But we also must draw attention to safe streets issues. To date, if you apply pressure, or the family fights, or advocates rally in the CB&#039;s and streets- piece meal changes might happen. How sad that streets got fixed a bit where the other boys died, but no one fixed 70th and Northern. We&#039;re calling for a comprehensive way to fix our streets, criminalize reckless driving and all the other things you&#039;ll write about...<br /><br />Vision Zero Design Standard: We urge the NYC Council to adopt the Vision Zero Design Standard to ensure that streets are designed by default to prevent dangerous driving and prioritize safety.<br />Speed Safety Cameras: NYS Legislature must pass a bill to expand the use of Speed Safety Cameras and enact legislation this session in Albany.<br />Hit and Run Legislation: We demand that the NYS Legislature pass a bill to increase the penalties to stop this heinous crime.<br />Comprehensive School Traffic Safety Plan: The DOT/DOE must create a safe passage to and from school for all NYC school children.<br />Victim Support: NYC needs to create a program supporting familes/victims of traffic violence via the office of the Public Advocate. <br /><br />Please join us- info in the link above. <br />

					Hi. <br />Our work is as diverse as our ethnicity, and so many here are dynamic artists, writers, theater folks etc...where do you do your work in the neighborhood? <br />E77 seems to discourage it, but I for one benefit from writing and researching among other like minded folks. <br />The library and Cafe Bene are pretty good spots, and I&#039;ve even enjoyed Staples on 93/Roosevelt. <br /><br />A friend and I are talking about opening a co-working space here. <br />Would you be interested? The model encompasses day rates, membership and rental for meetings. <br />Please share your thoughts. <br />In the meantime, I&#039;m off to E77, til I get that look, or fast reprimand.

					I&#039;m especially curious of the answer if you are one that commutes regularly to LGA for work or business. The construction is wreaking havoc on East Elmhurst and the GCP and the construction partners and elected don&#039;t seem to be taking it seriously. <br /><br />Over the weekend, a man was killed commuting to his job by bike. Over the last few years, myself and others have documented full bike racks at LGA as well as a number of people like my family who bike to pick up and drop off rental cars. <br /><br />I&#039;m calling for free shuttle service all the time, as well as a study on commuting for employees. From JH and surrounding areas, it&#039;s not even too far to walk there, as we do as well for rental cars. <br /><br />This tragedy is one of at least 5 fatalities in the last few years in our area. <br />It can be mitigated. <br />Our communities should stand up and demand improvements and accommodations for this project. <br />The Q33 quietly went away a few years ago, stranding many locals who commute to LGA. <br /><br />We are strong enough in numbers to actually work with the Gateway Partners to improve our community around this. Especially the corridor from Northern/GCP to the airport in all directions. <br /><br />My condolences to the family and friends of Steven Morales. This shouldn&#039;t have happened. <br />By the way, a shuttle bus driver killed him, but there are no reports on what company it was nor were any charges filed. I tweet under @MakeQueensSafer, if you&#039;re interested in safe streets in our area. <br />(from a MQS facebook post)- <br /><br />Rest in Peace to local LaGuardia employee Steven Morales who was killed as he biked from work for a company at the airport. It was initially a hit and run and cops now say it was a shuttle driver who hit him and &#039;didn&#039;t realize it&#039;. So, no charges for taking a life. This is horrible. The funeral will be in East Elmhurst. I think it&#039;s time we call on the airport and the construction companies working there to have a plan for the traffic, congestion and commuting by workers. I know your streets are clogged with workers cars. The Delta terminal alone has a renovation cost of $160 million. Surely there&#039;s a few bucks in there to figure out traffic. How about shuttle busses from 74th or Citi Field? Something has to be done. I&#039;m writing Costas, the other council member and Peralta and Gianaris- somebody tell Moya, as he blocked me.
