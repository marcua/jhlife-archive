					Todays NY Times states the following:<br /><br />In interviews, his supporters described Mr. Moya as a smart and loyal soldier for the Queens Democratic Party chairman, Representative Joseph Crowley. Mr. Crowleyâ€™s posters are all over the windows of Mr. Moyaâ€™s campaign headquarters on 37th Avenue, a narrow store where a clothes boutique called D-Lishus used to be.<br /><br />A person close to the Moya campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize Mr. Moya or Mr. Crowley, put it this way: â€œFrancisco took a pass whenever he needed to take a pass. <span class="bbc_u">Heâ€™s been overlooked without complaining. Now itâ€™s his turn.â€ </span> <br /><br />HIS TURN?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; What the Hell is that?&nbsp; For all of us that should really care about true democracy in our community why should we support a guy who has not lived in the district for a year ( a legal requirement). 2. Whose display of community service is as a lobbyist for CABLEVISION and third is the Queens County lap dog. Well?<br /><br />So Brian pulls out who I would have voted for and now what?&nbsp; I will NOT vote for either of the two Democratic candidates.&nbsp; Maybe I will wait till Novemeber and vote NONE OF THE ABOVE!&nbsp; I will vote for al the positions and skip the 39th Assembly.&nbsp; WE MUST SEND A MESAGE.&nbsp; Hopefully next time, in two years we can all come together and support a representative who really is from the community and can represent us well.

					I&#039;m not defending Mr. HM but for the record he was convicted of a reckless act for pulling her thru a hallway.&nbsp; He was found not guilty of anything else.&nbsp; In our legal system the facts are applied to the law and that&#039;s how decisions are made.&nbsp; I am no fan of his or most of our local pols who just about all have had legal an ethical shortcomings.&nbsp; But, the fact&#039;s are he was found guilty of pulling her which according to published reports he is appealing.<br /><br />Now for the bigger picture:<br /><br />For the record -&nbsp; Our Congressman is under investigation, our State Senator in under investigation,&nbsp; one of our local Councilmember&#039;s was convicted of Driving while intoxicated and even public lewdness aka &quot;prostitution&quot;.&nbsp; The other local Councilmember is also under investigation for public funds misuse.&nbsp; Even our current Boro President is under investigation by the Feds for getting favors from an architect in one of her &quot;3 homes&quot; in East Elmhurst.&nbsp; And who can forget Peralta&#039;s mentor Brian McClauglin who is doing 7 year in prison for ripping off 3 million dollars!&nbsp; <br />Wow, there is more......<br /><br />There are currently approximately 20 legislators in office today who have been convicted of DWI, Fraud, Assault, Tax Evasion etc etc.&nbsp; in office right now in NY.&nbsp; Many of them took plea deals to avoid felony convictions and to stay in office and these clowns can even pass a budget on time!&nbsp; <br /><br />We should all be appalled at this.&nbsp; Monserrate is just on guy, as crummy as he might be.&nbsp; I think we, including myself are hypocritical to just stone on person .&nbsp; There&#039;s plenty wrong with our local pols and the process where ONE BOSS of a Corrupt Democratic Machine picks a lobbyist from Cablevision that has NEVER done one single thing in our Jackson Heights community to be the standard bearer for the Democrats, it&#039;s shameful.<br /><br />Is there no other decent person from Jackson Heights that can run?&nbsp; Or do we all go to the pols and vote blank on the 39th Assembly.&nbsp; Perhaps that is how the Machine will hear our cries for better representation in our representative democracy.&nbsp; I think we should start the: <strong>vote blank movement!</strong><br />SIGNED, <br />FED UP!!!!!!!!!!!!

Carl Kruger revealed after FBI busts lawyer<br />Queens Congressman Joe Crowley is one of the most prolific campaign fund-raisers on Capitol Hill - a trait that now has him in the middle of an ongoing ethics investigation.<br /><br />Last month, the House Office of Congressional Ethics sent letters to a number of Washington lobbyists asking for documents related to fund-raising just before the Dec. 11 House vote on financial regulatory reform.<br /><br />The preliminary investigation centers on a bipartisan group by eight members, including Crowley.<br /><br />One of those who got a letter was Julie Domenick, a lobbyist who hosted a fund-raiser for Crowley Dec. 10 in her D.C. home. She confirmed the letter requested records related to her fund-raising.<br /><br />Domenick said that the Crowley event had been scheduled on Nov. 4, weeks before the final votes of regulatory reform.<br /><br />Crowley declined to discuss the Domenick event except to say through a spokesperson he &quot;has always complied with the letter and spirit of all rules regarding fund-raising and standards of conduct.&quot;<br /><br />Crowley, who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, is the top-ranking member of New York&#039;s House delegation and vice chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#039;s money machine.<br /><br />When he was first elected to Congress, labor unions were his biggest financial backers. They&#039;ve been eclipsed by financial, insurance and real estate interests, records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics show.<br /><br />By the 2008 election, half of Crowley&#039;s contributions came from those three industries.<br /><br />&quot;I think I&#039;ve matured here both personally and in terms of my assignments,&quot; Crowley said. &quot;Many people here in Washington view me as an important figure.&quot;<br /><br />In October, as the House wrestled with financial regulatory reform, Crowley and several other members of the New Democrat Coalition traveled to Wall Street to meet with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs executives.<br /><br />Crowley said the financial powerhouses are &quot;important to New York.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong with listening to people who will be affected by the legislation you&#039;re going to pass,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Crowley also has received tens of thousands of campaign dollars from real estate investment trusts - companies that use investors&#039; money to purchase and manage commercial real estate.<br /><br />Since 2008, a political action committee of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts has donated $33,500 for Crowley&#039;s campaign and leadership PAC.<br /><br />His donors had reason to be pleased with him. In 2008, Crowley pushed legislation that let the trusts resell properties faster without tax penalties.<br /><br />&quot;Mr. Crowley was very much central to the cause on the House side,&quot; one industry observer said.<br /><br />Then on Jan. 27, Crowley sponsored the Real Estate Revitalization Act of 2010 - a bill that would lower taxes on foreigners investing in real estate trusts.<br /><br />Four days later, Crowley flew to L.A. to attend the Grammy awards, at one point posing with pop star Katy Perry.<br /><br />While he was there, Peter Lowy, a top executive of the Westfield Group, an Australian-based developer whose lobbyists have pushed Crowley&#039;s bill, organized a Crowley fund-raiser at a restaurant called Toscanova.<br /><br />Lowy and his wife also have contributed $18,800 to Crowley since February 2008.<br /><br />A spokesman for Westfield said Lowy hosted the L.A. event as an individual. Crowley insisted it was &quot;crazy&quot; to think campaign money had any impact on his decision to sponsor the legislation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/06/27/2010-06-27_qns_pols_funds_flap_crowley_part_of_ethics_probe.html#ixzz0s5fnMb1b" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/06/27/2010-06-27_qns_pols_funds_flap_crowley_part_of_ethics_probe.html#ixzz0s5fnMb1b</a><br />

					Is there one honest pol in the bunch?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /> Here the latest from the Daily News-<br /><br /><br /><strong>Powerful Rep. Joe Crowley&#039;s ethics get closer eye</strong><br /><br />BY Ben Lesser and Michael Mcauliff In Washington<br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS<br /><br />Tuesday, June 15th 2010, 4:00 AM<br /><br />Lobbyist fund-raisers for powerful Rep. Joe Crowley are being asked about their dealings with the New York Democrat and seven other legislators, his office acknowledged Monday.<br /><br />House ethics cops apparently want to know whether their donations swayed lawmakers&#039; votes on the financial reform bill that passed the House last year, two lawmakers in the preliminary probe told The Hill newspaper.<br /><br />A Democrat familiar with such preliminary investigations said they often amount to nothing, but a letter from the House Office of Congressional Ethics obtained by The Hill says probers are especially interested in fund-raisers held from Dec. 2 to Dec. 11.<br /><br />Crowley&#039;s campaign raised a bit more than $40,000 in that span, federal records show.<br /><br />A Crowley spokesman said no wrongdoing will be found on his part, saying, &quot;Congressman Crowley has always complied with the letter and spirit of all rules regarding fund-raising and standards of conduct.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>While it was unclear what the watchdogs were seeking, an ongoing Daily News investigation of Crowley (D-Queens, Bronx) has found that he often relies on lobbyists and political action committees to raise cash</strong>.<br /><br />James Delaplane, with the Washington outfit Davis &amp; Harman, which has several financial services clients, raised $19,750 for Crowley at an event last year.<br /><br />&quot;My clients have supported [Crowley] for a long time,&quot; he said last month, well before news of the preliminary probe broke. Delaplane said yesterday his firm has not received letters from the congressional probers.<br /><br />Davis &amp; Harman founder Thomas Davis did donate $500 to Crowley on Dec. 11, though there was no other sign it might bear on the investigation.<br /><strong><br />Crowley has raised lots of cash from lobbyists and political action committees with business before his Ways and Means Committee, including real estate interests seeking favorable tax treatment. </strong>But Crowley told The News prior to the probe it was &quot;crazy&quot; to suggest donations have influenced his votes. &quot;I have never, ever, ever sold my vote,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/06/15/2010-06-15_crowleys_ethics_get_closer_eye.html#ixzz0r2TGfVQl" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/06/15/2010-06-15_crowleys_ethics_get_closer_eye.html#ixzz0r2TGfVQl</a><br />

					Below is the latest Blog on the 39th Assembly Race.&nbsp; What did Bryan get to pull out and why??&nbsp; I would never vote for Moya who does not even live in te district and is a total stooge of the party bosses.&nbsp; He is a paid lobbyist for Cablevision.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if Monserrate is running as he has not declared but there must be other options.&nbsp; So if Monserate doesn&#039;t run and Pufolkes is out then this guy just walks in?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; Should we all be ok with this?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />??&nbsp; JH, What are we to do? SOMEONE PLEASE STEP UP!!!<br /><br />PS I think Monserrate&#039;s point about Peralta working to deal with a multi billion dollar deficit as opposed to politicking was on point, though many of us don&#039;t hold him in the highest regard.&nbsp; <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Pu-Folkes Out... But Who&#039;s In? Would You Believe... Maybe Monserrate? UPDATED! Â»<br /><br />By Celeste Katz<br /><br />Bryan Pu-Folkes is pulling out of the Assembly race to replace now-State Sen. Jose Peralta, where he was facing Francisco Moya in a battle to represent the Queens district.<br /><br />You can read Pu-Folkes&#039; full email after the jump, although it doesn&#039;t really explain why he&#039;s leaving. However, Moya has gathered considerable organizational support for the seat, including the backing of Peralta.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the interesting part: One of the names floating around as a possible entrant into the race: HIRAM MONSERRATE.<br /><br />Yes, that Hiram Monserrate: The former Marine and cop who was ejected from his state Senate berth after a domestic violence conviction, sued to get his job back, and then waged a spectacularly failed special election bid to return to Albany.<br />monserrate pic.jpg<br /><br />I got him on his cell phone just now.<br /><br />After all, he did promise after the special not to rule anything out.<br /><br />&quot;All I can tell you is that I&#039;m going to have lunch right now,&quot; he told me.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the quote you were looking for.&quot;<br /><br />You&#039;re damn right about that, mister!<br /><br />Said Peralta:<br /><br />&quot;I hear a lot of rumors that he may throw his hat in the ring. but you know, it&#039;s a democracy. If he chooses to do so he will, but voters will have an opportunity to vote on someone who has not only disgraced state government, but has really not yet apologized in full for what has occurred. So if he throws his hat in the ring, he&#039;s going to have to deal with those issues again. But we&#039;ll see next week -- petitioning starts next Tuesday. We&#039;ll see what he&#039;s circulating, if anything.&quot;<br /><br />UPDATE! Monserrate called me back with a little something to add about Peralta:<br /><br />&quot;Mr. Jose Peralta should focus a little more on the two-months-past-deadline budget in the state of New York, the budget deficit, which is the several billions of dollars, and, on the local front, maybe he can do something about the overflowing garbage cans<br />on 37th Ave. and Roosevelt Ave.,&quot; Monserrate said. &quot;He should be doing his job of representing the people and a little less politicking. He hasn&#039;t done too much since he&#039;s gotten there.&quot;<br /><br />As for Pu-Folkes, Peralta said, &quot;We&#039;re sort of forming what we call a &#039;unity team&#039; in the northwest part of Queens, and I think he sort of saw that and said maybe he should be part of that. it&#039;s goign to be pretty impressive. We&#039;re going to have a pretty diverse team where we&#039;re going to be dealing with a lot of issues on all levels.&quot;<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/06/pu-folkes-out-but-whos-in-woul.html#ixzz0px0JqAFQ" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/06/pu-folkes-out-but-whos-in-woul.html#ixzz0px0JqAFQ</a><br />

					Heads up,,,,,,, the corrupt Tammany Hall of Queens strikes again!!!&nbsp; Ms. Jessica Ramos who is really pleasant has suspiciously moved into the 39th Assembly District to replace Dorothy Phelan who left the new Senator Peralta&#039;s office under BAD terms. Seems like Jose is a regular little dictator ruling his kingdom.&nbsp; <br />PS - Why did Jessica agree to move though she has not legally done so yet.?&nbsp; We shall see if she really lives in the district.&nbsp; Jackson Heights keep your eyes open and let us know if she really moves!!!&nbsp; Our Queens version of Senator Espada residency antics of the Bronx could be Ms. Ramos along with Carozza from Bayside who got outed in Long Island!&nbsp;

					I was dismayed again by the current political machinations of the Democrats in Queens.&nbsp; Will it ever get better?<br />Here goes&nbsp; a few days ago Joe Crowley the pro war, pro patriotic act congressman who also chairs our local Tamany Hall Queens democratic <br />Machine endorsed Fransisco Mo ya for the Assembly seat in the 39th AD.&nbsp; WOW&nbsp; What corruption.&nbsp; You see Mo ya is the former staffer to the hapless Gov. Paterson who did a favor to the CORRUPT Qns. County Machine chair Joe Crowley by not calling a special election thus leaving us without a rep in Albany for close to a year.&nbsp; Why?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; So that Crowley&#039;s lapdog ass kissing crony Moya could run ( A 3 time loser in local elections).&nbsp; You see, while he was busy making a six figure salary as a lobbyist for CABLEVISION (another Crowley connect) he was not eligible to run in the special election because he did NOT LIVE IN THE DISTRICT!!!!&nbsp; So our Hack Guv did a solid to Qns. Tamany and didn&#039;t call it.<br />Wow now all the other Dem flunkies are flocking to Mud Man Moya.&nbsp; Check his voter card at the Board of Election.<br />Jackson Heights wake up!!!! <img src="Smileys/default/angry.gif" alt="&gt;&#58;&#40;" title="Angry" class="smiley" />

					Please take this disingenious campaign piece off this site.&nbsp; This a site where community can voice their opinions.&nbsp; People for Dromm is a campaign committee filed with the NYC Campaign Finance Board.&nbsp; This in fact might be a campaign violation since a quick review does not show an expense for posting on community blogs!<br /><br />The short and simple is that this is just another cynical message to collect emails.&nbsp; Are opinion to one councilmember who has very very little input on the budget will not change one bit.&nbsp; Its the Mayors Budget and lapdog Quinn will follow along as she has done every year.&nbsp; I wish all our local pols would stop scamming us.&nbsp; &nbsp;
