Upon arrival at a site, residents must check in with the Department Supervisor, who will take down the personâ€™s name, address, vehicle registration, and the Special Waste to be dropped off.<br /><br />Department personnel will then instruct residents to empty their Special Wastes into labeled storage containers. After emptying their Special Wastes, residents are expected to deposit their empty paint cans, corrugated cardboard, and any trash into designated containers for proper recycling and/or disposal.<br /><br />The Department suggests that residents using the Special Waste Drop-Off Sites dress accordingly. For example, sturdy shoes, casual clothing, work gloves, and safety glasses are recommended. If dropping off paint, please bring something to open paint cans, such as a screw driver.<br /><br />For more information about the Household Special Waste Drop-off program, call the New York City Citizen Service Center at 311.
