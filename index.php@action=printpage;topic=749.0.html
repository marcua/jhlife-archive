				I&#039;m a fairly avid cyclist - but Queens is not known to be the safest place to be a cyclist / pedestrian. Maybe Jackson Heights is alright - but can anyone recommend the best routes to either bike to Flushing Meadow park&nbsp; - or the Queensboro Bridge? Any other places you recommend biking to?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Chris check out the thread on running routes because it mentions biking.&nbsp; And riding to the 59th Street Bridge is CRAZY dangerous. I almost got hit by cars more than once when I used to do it.&nbsp; Try riding to Astoria Park. (also talked about on the running thread.)

				Hi there.&nbsp; I am also an avid cyclist, and I want to share the safest way to get to the bridge (in my opinion):&nbsp; take the 34th ave. bike path to 59th street, then south (left) on 59th to 39th ave.&nbsp; Make a right on 39th ave, which makes a short left turn up woodside ave before continuing again as 39th ave.&nbsp; I make a left on either 48th street or 46th street for one block through sunnyside gardens, and then a right onto skillman ave.&nbsp; Skillman flows right into queens blvd, but there is a bike path right there which puts you right at queens plaza.&nbsp; At Queens plaza, follow queens plaza north, and this will flow right onto the 59th street bridge path.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found this to be a very fast and safe route -- certainly better than Broadway to steinway, or norther blvvd!!&nbsp; These streets have little car traffic, and the route is rather scenic.&nbsp; I especially enjoy biking through sunnyside gardens.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually at the bridge in about 10 minutes from my apartment on 78th street.&nbsp; To be honest, I think of this as more of a commute, and less of a joyride...

				Thanks for the advice! I&#039;ve also done the ride to Sunnyside and then get on Greenpoint ave to get to Brooklyn. I really like riding to Prospect Park or Central Park as destinations. I also feel that as long as you wear a helmet and try to keep pace with traffic you&#039;ll be just fine.

				Soundslover, that sounds like a good route. I may try that sometime. <br /><br />I ride in once or twice a week, and I live on 84th between Roosevelt and 37th. I also take Skillman to the bridge, but to save a bit of time from where I am, I just ride down Roosevelt. It isn&#039;t extremely pleasant or anything, but the traffic eases up after the BQE, and never moves that fast. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried Broadway, through Astoria, to come out to Queensboro Plaza from the north end, but Broadway is worse than Roosevelt and it takes more time. <br /><br />My biggest beef is Midtown. The least pleasant part of my ride is on the other side of the bridge. I&#039;ve seriously thought of riding to the Williamsburg bridge and coming over down there. Although that would just take more time too. Typically I can get to work faster on my bike that by the train.

				Coming off the Williamsburg bridge is not the most pleasant experience either. Delancey street has tons of cars. Of all the bridges to Manhattan that I have riden over i&#039;d say the Manhattan bridge is the best - it exists onto Grand, then you can go up North on Allen to first ave. Though this was more my bridge from when I lived in Brooklyn.

However, I will point out a few things for riders who are looking to try a J. Hts -Manhattan commute for the first time:<br /><br />1. There are some small hills on this route. Very small, but you feel these if you are out of shape, carrying a lot of stuff on a heavy commuter bike, etc. You are also exposed to some winds on Stillman near the Queens Plaza bike path. my normal route* avoids these two things.<br /><br />2. Note that when coming home, you will have to use 43rd Ave. instead of Stillman, and 60th street instead of 59th, as they are one way streets.<br /><br />3. The areas between the bike path and the bridge are a little dicey. If you are not comfortable riding through these intersections, please get off and walk your bike as a pedestrian. Note that the bike path seems to end right before the corner near the bridge; don&#039;t be surprised if police ticket you for riding all the way to the corner on the sidewalk.<br /><br />* I normally do the 34th ave bike lane to Broadway. Rt on Bwy, cross Northern Blvd., go past the Woodside housing development (watch for doors on parked cars!) and then I begin to weave left and right on the back roads, staying as close to Northern Blvd, but just north of it, as possible. I basically go with the flow of traffic, turning as the lights allow. Eventually I wind up on 28th street or Crescent which take me right down to the bridge ramp intersection. This method probably takes a bit longer, but it spares you the winds, is more flat, and cuts out much of the crazy merging intersections near the bridge. It&#039;s also nice to vary and have a slightly different route each time. It&#039;s just as quiet traffic-wise, if not more-so.<br /><br />By all means try both and see which works best for you. If not for the hideous traffic, I&#039;d love to use Northern - definitely the fastest most straight path to the QBB (Do NOT ride on the sidewalks - you Will get a ticket!!). <br /><br />I used to work near City Hall and took roosevelt to greenpoint Ave and then Driggs/Bedford to/from the WBB - I found it a fast fun ride, though windy and hilly on the way back at night.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

(heading south towards the 7 train). at Roosevelt, make a left, and ride about 1/10 of a mile till you get past the over pass, and there will be a paved path on your right going downhill towards the road that leads to the park. It may be easier to just get off at Roosevelt and walk the bike on the sidewalk till you see the path.

				Fixie rider! &lt;333<br /><br />but yeah, if you wanna go to flushing and not deal with roosevelt<br /><br />take 34th ave straight till the end heading towards flushing now when you reach the end of 34th your gonna have to cross like this mini highway thing most people don&#039;t believe it&#039;s a walkway but it is, you ride past the highway cross&nbsp; your gonna reach another mini highway exit which is meant to cross and than you go down this ramp and bam your infront of shea, you ride straight down the road and your at the globe i do it alot late night&nbsp; you can ride as fast as you want. takes like 15 minutes from 78th street but i dont stop though.. i would show you tonight since its gonna really nice to ride to flushing but i get out late from work. <br /><br />any<br /><br />questions ask me.

				Lol. <br /><br />I look at like this, before you get your license you get a manual about traffic laws and safety,&nbsp; after you pass the test and being to drive over time apparently everyone forgets what they have learned and make up there own rules. <br /><br />My worst enemy the cabbie driver lol.<br /><br />But I do agree there are some cyclist that just think they can do w.e. they want. So there are two views.<br /><br />&nbsp;Any who back to cycling anyone doing the tour de queens?

				NY Times article on the Manhattan bicycle parking shortage features a JH bike commuter...&nbsp; <br /><br />The New York Times<br />For City Commuters, Same Old Story for Another Vehicle: Parking Is Scarce (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/nyregion/01bike.html)<br />By COLIN MOYNIHAN<br />Published: July 1, 2008<br /><br />When Carlos Martinez bicycles to work in Manhattan from his home in Jackson Heights, Queens, he must ride along Northern Boulevard, a broad and busy thoroughfare, before crossing the Queensboro Bridge and heading south on Second Avenue toward the East Village.<br /><br />It is a commute that few bicyclists would relish.<br /><br />But when Mr. Martinez gets to his office on East Fourth Street, where he works as the Latin American liaison for an environmental group called Green Map System, he becomes the envy of riders across the city. That is because the office building allows him to bring his bike upstairs and stash it in a walk-in closet alongside bikes belonging to three or four co-workers.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s one less problem for me,â€ Mr. Martinez said. â€œAt least I know my vehicle is O.K., so Iâ€™m pretty sure I can get back home safely.â€<br /><br />It may seem like a simple sentiment, but having a safe place to store a bike at work is an urban amenity that ranks somewhere with having unfettered roof access or a key to a community garden. While people are generally free to wheel their bikes in and out of residential buildings, commercial buildings often ban them.<br /><br />At a time when, city officials say, the number of people cycling in New York is soaring and the city has been implementing a plan to create 200 miles of new bike lanes, one glaring problem for those who want to cycle to work is the shortage of parking, particularly in areas like Midtown Manhattan. <br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em>

				I just want to say that I love riding my bike in the area. The traffic doesnt go that fast so you can pretty safely ride. It is such a rush to ride with traffic. I do go through some reds, but only when it&#039;s safe and I stop before. Other than that, I follow the traffic laws.&nbsp; Also, riding late at night is great, there&#039;s always things going on. And the different neighborhoods are so intermingled, it doesnt get boring.

				If you take 114th to Roosevelt (about a block or two past the highway entrance) and turn left you hit Shea, and there are signs for the park and Queens Museum. However, that&#039;s as far as I went... I didn&#039;t have time to explore further (and hopefully find an actual entrance to the park). Hopefully someone can help us both out!<br /><br /><br />On a side note, when I was riding over there I rode on the sidewalk, which probably isn&#039;t right, but it&#039;s a really wide asphalt sidewalk and Roosevelt is scary!

				Okay this is the secret passage way lol...<br /><br />Well once you reach 114th you can make a right to head to Roosevelt, or you can continue foward but you will see the highway now what you do it is go slightly left instead of right and you will see a little walk way, I suggest you dismount your bike if you wanna cross this way since you will have to wait for the cars to clear a bit, than once you cross you will reach this like path way that is like bridge, you go over it and you will be literally be infront of shea and a newly constructed parking lot they have, you ride down and follow the path and you will reach the globe.

				Hi all. I&#039;m new to the neighborhood, well, actually returning after living in Astoria for 6 years. Yay!! Really happy to see a cycling community in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />I was one of the people quoted in the article listed above, and also one of the founding members of the Queens committee of Transportation Alternatives. We&#039;ve been around for about a year and a half, organizing the Tour de Queens and helping to get more bike routes and safer streets in our neighborhoods. Secure bike parking is another area of interest for us, and wouldn&#039;t it be great if such a thing existed at the 74th St. station? <br /><br />It is one of TA&#039;s missions to branch out into all of Queens, especially Jackson Heights. October brings weekly safety rides down Queens boulevard, from the QueensBorough Bridge, as well as a Mixer for new and old members, and something I am helping to organize...a bike scavenger hunt around the East River Parks, for Its My Park Day October 25th! <br /><br />Information can be found either at http://www/transalt.org or our groups google groups page,&nbsp; http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ<br />which has alot of talk, action and banter about biking in Queens. <br /><br />Also in October we are planning a Queens membership drive, where new members will receive an &quot;I bike Queens&quot; T- Shirt, among the other great things membership in TA offers. (bike store discounts, a very informative newsletter, connections to the NYC cycling community, and opportunities for advocacy, volunteering and rides! <br /><br />We meet monthly. (info on the google groups page). Though we have been meeting in Astoria, the group is looking to find a new meeting space in Jackson Heights, in order to meet and attract the cycling community here. <br /><br />If anyone knows of a meeting space, please let me know. Hope to see you all on the streets soon! <br />Also, thanks for the tips on routes to the bridge and other locations!!

				Tonight, Monday, January 12th, a Community Board 3 committee will discuss NYC Dept. of City Planning&#039;s proposal to require indoor bicycle parking in new buildings.&nbsp; <br /><br />The New York Post has an article about the program here (http://www.nypost.com/seven/01092009/news/regionalnews/pedal_pushers_149361.htm).&nbsp; So far, the proposal has received support from 15 Community Boards.&nbsp; It won&#039;t make much of a difference here, since we don&#039;t have much new construction, but it could make a big difference to overall bicycle conditions in the city.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like to attend the meeting, more information is available here (http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/page/1623/index.v3page?c_v=evt&amp;c_dt=2454844&amp;c_eid=113371&amp;c_mid=0).&nbsp; The proposal will probably also be discussed at the full CB3 meeting later this week, but an agenda has not yet been released.

City Planning Commissioner Amanda Burden said the route covers on? and off?street bicycle lanes throughout Queens and highlights numerous destinations that feature the boroughâ€™s diverse cultures and architecture.<br /><br />â€œThe tour is designed so cyclists can take a single 18?mile trip or multiple short trips, making it appealing to return again and again to explore all that Queens has to offer â€” a host of opportunities for cultural, culinary and historical exploration,â€ Burden said.<br /><br />The route, which runs from Astoria to Flushing, includes a variety of noteworthy borough sites, such as Astoriaâ€™s St. Irene Chrysovalantou Greek Monastery, Elmhurstâ€™s Geeta Hindu Temple, Coronaâ€™s Louis Armstrong House Museum, Flushing Town Hall and Jackson Heightsâ€™ Scrabble Avenue, which was named after the gameâ€™s inventor, Alfred Mosher Butts.<br /><br />The City Planning guide also tells participants where they can park their bikes and explore the boroughâ€™s landmarks or visit its shopping districts and ethnic cuisines on foot. Much of the route parallels the No. 7 subway line, Burden said.<br /><br />Riders will pass through communities inhabited by immigrants from Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Greece, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Romania, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago and Turkey.<br /><br />Queens Around the World has been created in conjunction with a variety of other city initiatives to promote bicycling as part of Mayor Michael Bloombergâ€™s PlaNYC initiative to make the city greener by 2030, Burden said.<br /><br />Other city efforts include the requirement of long?term bicycle parking in new multi?family buildings or commercial buildings, bicycle parking in community parking lots, the creation of 140 miles of bicycle routes across the five boroughs and the addition of 5,000 new outdoor bicycle racks by 2011.

				Just wanted to revive this old thread as it has helped me tremendously in biking around queens from JH.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to add a nice quick route to Astoria park that I&#039;ve discovered: I&#039;m at 82nd/37th av so I bike over to 81st street which I take all the way down to 25th av.&nbsp; From there, make your way to 80th and head north, crossing over the Grand Central.&nbsp; Then make a slight left to go north on 78th. At the end of the street (19th road), take a left and then a right to Hazen.&nbsp; From there you can go left to 20th av and that will bring you all the way to the park (you can also use 19th av, but 20th av actually has a bike lane).&nbsp; It&#039;s about 20 minutes with not too many hills and little traffic.&nbsp; The busiest intersection is the one prior to crossing the GCP but it&#039;s pretty safe and the lights last a while, otherwise it&#039;s mostly stop signs and quiet areas without too many cars.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a great driving route to Astoria and I use it all the time to pickup some Greek food to bring home.<br />Good luck!
