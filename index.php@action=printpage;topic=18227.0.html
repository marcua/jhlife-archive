				I just searched this board and cannot find the posting, but I recall that there was going to be a branch of a little French bistro, based maybe in LIC, that was planning to open in the mall where Cannelle is located.&nbsp; I was just over there (I hardly ever go there) and see no sign of anything under construction. Does anyone know what happened? Wish I could recall the name of the place, but it looked like an exciting addition to the neighborhood.

				Actually, work is under way. The restaurant is right next to Canelle, in the corner of the mall, which is why you may have missed it. They seem to be making steady progress, and last week, the renovation looked like it was wrapping up. They&#039;d installed the wainscotting and the benches. <br /><br />

				&nbsp;I&#039;ve tended to avoid going over there on the weekend because the wait for a bus was so long when I don&#039;t feel like walking, so pleased to see that the Q47 now seems to have decent Saturday and Sunday service. <br /><br />Now, if only there were a convenient bus to the park in Astoria...!

				They will be opening for brunch in the next week or two and plan to open for lunch in the next few weeks. Of course, plans sometimes go awry, but that&#039;s what the waiter told me when I ate there Wednesday night. Btw, the food was quite good. Surprisingly, there were a lot of French people at surrounding tables.

				Tried them out, really nice space and staff/owner.&nbsp; The burger was definitely the best in the neighborhood and on par with other memorable burgers in the city.&nbsp; The addition of &quot;pickled&quot; avocados and the special sauce was really tasty, as well as the brioche bun to hold it all together.&nbsp; Look forward to trying their brunch which is starting this weekend and other items on the classic French bistro menu. Lucky to have this in the neighborhood, worth the effort to head a few blocks north...hope they do well.&nbsp;

				My wife and I made our way to Bistro Eloise on Tuesday and it knocked our socks off! Loved everything about it. It was a slow night, but we appreciated the calmness. I had the escargot and beef bourguignon. Then finished with lemon dessert that was delicious, but whose name I forgot. Anyway, it was amazing. The ambiance was thoughtful designed as well. Such a great new addition. Highly recommended. It’s really exciting to have all these new additions.

				We’ve had dinner here twice in the past month or so. Enjoyed the food, ambience, and staff so much. It’s a real treat to have French comfort food on a cold winter’s night - last visit my husband ordered the Blanquette de Veau and I had the Coq au Vin.
