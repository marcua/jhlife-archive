				I have three small A/C units (6,000 btu&#039;s) for which I need to install mounting brackets in 3 separate windows.&nbsp; Do you know or can you recommend any individual or local shop in Jackson Heights that can do this kind of a small job?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

				Sears replaced a small unit of mine.&nbsp; The company that installed it was:&nbsp; Independent Appliance Installers 1-800-326-8738.<br /><br />Carl installed my unit.&nbsp; He was very neat and concerned that he not damage or scratch anything.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what they would charge since my installation was part of a warranty replacement.&nbsp; I would definitely call them if I needed a re-install.

				as of last year, our super was told he&#039;s not permitted to install units for us. we ended up using Butler, in Jamaica. efficient, on time, polite and expensive. (718) 291-4838 (they don&#039;t seem to have an online presence.

				Our super was also not allowed to install units, due to liability issues. So I hired a super from another building. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have the contact info anymore, but you could ask around to supers of nearby buildings if yours is not allowed to do it for your own building.
