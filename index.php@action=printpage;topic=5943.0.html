				Mark you calendars now!<br /><br />Face the Music plays Jackson Heights, Sunday, March 20th, at 5 PM - Jewish Center of Jackson Heights, 37-06 77th St .<br /><br />The talented teens and tweens of Face the Music are coming to the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights on Sunday, March 20th, at 5 PM, to present a free, high-energy concert of classical contemporary music.&nbsp; Best suited for age 5 and up, the centerpiece of the concert is a new music classic: Steve Reichâ€™s Tehillim (â€œPsalmsâ€). Originally released on LP in 1981, this half-hour work speeds along on waves of drumming and song. Also on the program are three short works â€“ Dan Beckerâ€™s Gridlock, Paul Schoenfieldâ€™s High Rock Ballet, and Jacob TVâ€™s Syracuse Blues, for string quartet and the recorded sounds of an Italian fishmonger! Throughout the performance, the young players will speak about the music, and are happy to take questions at the end. <br /><br />The amazing young ensemble is in residence at the Kaufmann Center and is made of of students from the Special Music School (PS 859) and the Young Artists Program at the Lucy Moses School.&nbsp; They perform works all around the city&nbsp; and &quot;break the boundaries of classical music education and performance, featuring today&#039;s music presented by emerging artistic voices of tomorrow&quot;&nbsp; ( http://kaufman-center.org/special-music-school/face-the-music).<br /><br />Face the Music was founded and is directed by Jackson Heights&#039; own, Jenny Undercoffler.<br /><br />Bring yourself and your aspiring young musician(s) to this free, local concert and they are sure to be inspired by the extraordinary level of talent and creativity of these young people.<br /><br />See you there!<br /><br /><br />
