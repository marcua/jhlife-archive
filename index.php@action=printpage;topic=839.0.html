				<em><strong>I decided to start&nbsp; a Jackson Heights &quot;PhotoForum&quot; <br /><br />Grab your cameras and start shooting.&nbsp; Don&#039;t try to take the most perfect picture, we are just trying to have some fun.&nbsp; Simply have a camera with you whenever you remember and simply go about your day as usual.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget that you are trying to convey a message and possibly a feeling or feelings for that matter.&nbsp; Remember that the photo should be within the JH boundaries and not just in the Historical District.&nbsp; Preferably of buildings and scenes of panoramic value but it could also be of people walking around that would inspire any sentiments.&nbsp; JH does have it&#039;s own and varied fauna and its diverse inhabitants can sometimes cause laughter and sadness. <br /><br />We should try to avoid backgrounds that are confusing because your message , if any, may get lost with it or &quot;compete&quot; and complicate the subject matter. If you are trying to isolate the subject try to center onto it and explain the photo if you feel it warrants one.&nbsp; Some photos need no explanation but as a final touch you may want to title it to make it your own.<br /><br />So grab your digital or 35MM and start your drive-by&#039;s or walk-by&#039;s for that matter!&nbsp; &nbsp;:2funny:</strong></em><br /><br />&nbsp;:smitten:

				Great idea!&nbsp; But just for future reference, there are oodles of fantastic photos to be found on flickr.com by searching on &quot;jackson heights (http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22Jackson+heights%22&amp;m=text)&quot; or &quot;jacksonheights (http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22jacksonheights%22+&amp;m=tags)&quot;

				<strong>You are right, as with most well known or &quot;hot&quot; areas I found hundreds and thousands of photos everywhere...but it would be nice to see the perspective of the members here.&nbsp; It says a lot, I think, about what makes people tick or what they may find interesting.&nbsp; By the way, I am hoping for up to date photos and not downloaded stuff in the web.&nbsp; For anyone reading, they should be your own taken by you.<br /><br />I am hoping to get some today, but the day has become C R A Z Y!!!&nbsp; :D</strong>

				As far as I know, it&#039;s a file size limit, not a total limit in terms of how many photos you are allowed to post during your membership on this site.&nbsp; Check your file size - I think the limit is 128KB.&nbsp; I had to manipulate mine in photoshop in order to reduce the file size and still make them big enough to see.

				This is neat ...

What makes you think I would know anything about a leather store? Iâ€™ll have you know Iâ€™ve promenaded up and down 82<sup>nd</sup> street a number of times and do not even recall Top Gun Leather. (By the way, did I mention I visited that new London Boutique on Roosevelt and 78<sup>th</sup> Saturday night. The manager/associate Anthony was very friendly. But that is a story for another thread.) Sadly, Heather came to Jackson Heights with agenda, and honestly I cannot blame her. The audacious, insulting Jack Heights billboard in Williamsburg she mentioned in another article was fresh in her mind, and it clouded her perspective on a great neighborhood. She probably would have liked us better had someone handed her a cholado or mango lassi, but at least our trademark tempura hot dogs got promotion. Our schlock stores may not inspire great pride of place, but our food certainly does. I do want to pick up one of those crazy <em>hijab</em> Barbie knapsacks though.

				the hipsters and wannabes flocked to williamsburg 5+ years ago. they followed the artsy, cool, experimental crowd. The only reasons they were there in the first place was because rent was cheap and it was close to manhattan. Well, willliamsburg before that was full of factories, construction, warehouses. There is an extreme amount of pollution in the streets, and even still the trucks that go through there destroy the air/ground.&nbsp; It really is a naturally terrible place to live. <br /><br />so the biggest reason people are living there now is that they are chasing the people they think are cool. what do you know? they are actually chasing them out with the prices.... Luckily for them, there are at least 4 or 5 huge million dollar apartment buildings being put up there. it&#039;s going to seriously mess up their real estate market. Now, all the people overpaying for crappy apartments will be paying a correct amount for a really nice place. and all those crappy places are going to remain crappy and lose all their value. <br /><br />greenpoint is cool because of the eastern european population, but it isnt much better than williamsburg and the kids are spilling into there now. It was actually one of the 3 neighborhoods I was considering before I moved here (the other ft. greene). <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to say too much to promote the area yet. I need the prices to stay low. in short, the infrastructure and population are the strong points. id like to get involved in getting more new neighbors - but not too many.

				I went over to 82<sup>nd</sup> Street and Roosevelt Avenue yesterday and saw that Top Gun Leather is indeed on 82<sup>nd</sup>. I then went into Americaâ€™s 99Â¢ Store and bought a so-called â€œ<em>Chador</em> Barbieâ€ bag. Mine is different than the one in the picture in that it is rectangular, and thus looks less like a knapsack; the background is pink rather than blue; and the larger doll picture can only be seen from the waist up.<br /><br />(http://www.newyorkshitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/barbiewithchador.jpg)<br /><br />Look at her shirt and see that she is not Barbie at all but <strong>Fulla</strong>, the fashion doll that originated in Syria. See her Web page (http://www.fulla.us/) and read the Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulla_(doll)) about her. Just another piece of crap for my collection, and likely a knockoff at that.

				I have been wandering Jackson Heights and Woodside taking pictures of Bangla signs as part of my learning the Bengali script. I intend to write a series of articles documenting these signs, but in the meantime, a few of my pictures were published in someone elseâ€™s article: Farid Akbar, â€œA fuller picture of Bangladeshi New York (http://banglaglobal.blogspot.com/2008/12/as-i-mentioned-earlier-few-posts.html),â€ <em>Bangla in Use Globally</em>, 2 December 2008.

Although Bangla vocabulary clearly comes with the territory, most of the signs are surprisingly in transliterated English. I have always been a script and typography enthusiast, as well as an armchair linguist. I had also started to notice similarities between Near Eastern cultures and South Asian cultures, especially, not surprisingly, where the two geographically touched, liked Afghani and Pakistani cultures. Indian movie musicals are also very popular in Near Eastern and North African communities, and I love movie musicals in general, so I began to start recognizing Hindi and Urdu words from hearing them repeatedly in songs. My knowledge of the Arabic/Persian script allowed me to read and write the Urdu words, many of which were of Persian or Arabic origin. My contact with and subsequent love for Urdu led me to take some interest in the South Asian scripts and how they worked, but I never really learned one.<br /><br />Then I moved to Jackson Heights, and I was in the unusual situation of being in a largely Muslim community but not being able to read their signs. (I spent a fair amount of time in Egypt and Morocco, so knowing the Arabic script was quite helpful then, but useless for Bangla.) Bangla is closely related to Hindi and Urdu, so I decided not to let the daunting South Asian scripts frighten me, and I dove right in and bought dictionaries at Butala Emporium and started reading online. Now I love it. Iâ€™m still not at a point where I can recognize <em>every</em> letter, particularly when theyâ€™re connected in complex ligatures, but basic knowledge of the Bengali script has opened up a whole new segment of the local community to me.

				Marlene, if you are using a photoediting software like photoshop, just save the jpg at a lower quality.&nbsp; On the photoshop version I&#039;m using, I think 12 is the highest quality.&nbsp; Try saving it as a 4 and see what happens.&nbsp; It should come out bigger on this site.

				Shelby2, thanks for your help. For some reason, I STILL can&#039;t get the img tagging to work for me. For example, I tried with this random link (not mine) to flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/notsogoodphotography/503637906/<br /><br />(http://www.flickr.com/photos/notsogoodphotography/503637906/)<br /><br />Is there any hope for img-challenged people?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Chocopie, the way I&#039;ve uploaded photos to JHL is by using an image hosting site like Photobucket (http://photobucket.com/). &nbsp;Once you have a photo that you like uploaded to that site, what you do is just copy the image code that automatically appears at the base of the photo when you hover over it with your mouse. &nbsp;Look for the link that has the following codes surrounding it:<br /><br />(IMG) (/IMG)<br /><br />Keep in mind that the codes must be surrounded by brackets rather than parenthesis like I have above. &nbsp;Hit copy, and then paste that into the message box on your reply in JHL. &nbsp;The image should appear on the screen when you hit preview.<br /><br />Other members...feel free to chime in also.<br /><br />
