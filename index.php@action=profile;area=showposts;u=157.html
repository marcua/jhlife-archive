					I live in the building and we don&#039;t know yet.&nbsp; Fire marshall report is &quot;pending&quot; which isn&#039;t uncommon.&nbsp; Even with it pending we can go and pick up the report which is good.&nbsp; The shareholder and roommate have told several different people a different story.&nbsp; &nbsp; Our insurance company will be by this week so I&#039;m hoping they have info from the Insurance Adjuster who came the night of the fire. In the meantime the clean up and restoration for those affected is not happening fast enough.&nbsp; It amazes me how many companies take on more work then they can handle.&nbsp; &nbsp;They say they&#039;ll be there on Monday and a shareholder takes off work AND then they don&#039;t show up.&nbsp; That annoys me.&nbsp;

					I live off 34th and 87th so usually go the bagel store on Northern and 87th Street corner.&nbsp; Have no idea what bagel store people are talking about on 86th and Northern unless they just got the block wrong.&nbsp; I think the bagels are better though at the Northern/89th Street bagel store but since neither one is like Murray&#039;s or H&amp;H in the City, it&#039;s not worth the two extra blocks.&nbsp; A toasted sesame at 87th Street is just fine enough for me.<br />

					Porto Bella over in Astoria on Ditmas has FREE parking above and below ground.&nbsp; The below ground always has plenty of space.&nbsp; Porto Bella is my friends &#039;go-to&#039; Mom &amp; Pop style Italian restaurant/pizza place.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been going there for years.&nbsp; They have a separate party room attached to the restaurant.&nbsp; I like the food, look of the place (low-key but nicely done) and the people.<br /><br />Definitely my favorite pizza in Queens but also their entrees are really good.&nbsp; My faves: eggplant parm. dinner, Manicotti, spaghetti and meatballs (when I used to eat meat) ... great salads.&nbsp; Go check them out.&nbsp; I copied their link cause it has the party room. But the place is large enough that I would bet you could reserve space inside for 25 people!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m just an Italian Amer. gal who loves pizza, pasta and wine.<br /><a href="http://www.portobellopizzeria.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.portobellopizzeria.com</a>

					I finally discovered this wine store.&nbsp; Because it&#039;s on 87th Street right off Northern (between Northern and 32nd Street), I never saw it.&nbsp; I never walk down 87th Street even though I go into the corner bagel store all the time!&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; But man was I happy I walked in.&nbsp; Beautiful looking, well planned, large, attractive space.&nbsp; And the best part, for me, I live one block away on 87th and 34th.&nbsp; Usually I walk over to 89th/90th to that liquor store where the owner is behind bullet proof glass (WTF!) and they have a mediocre to bad selection of wines but they were the closest walking shop.<br /><br />NOT ANY MORE!&nbsp; Addictive Boutique Winery you have a new customer.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to tell friends who live in my building.

					Decided to stop in for lunch and try a bento box special.&nbsp; Was happy to see the place was busy even during lunch.&nbsp; They added two more tables near the bar area I&#039;m guessing because they&#039;re doing a brisk business. Interior decor is a huge deal to me only because this neighborhood has some of the most unattractive or bland places to dine in.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to eat in a restaurant that&#039;s actually attractively designed.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not such a big deal if a place seems clean and the food is good.<br /><br />I have to remember that even if a dish says pad thai vegetables it doesn&#039;t mean animal product won&#039;t be mixed in.&nbsp; My pad thai had eggs which I know is traditional so I wasn&#039;t upset but it made me realize I have to order more carefully if I want vegetarian.&nbsp; <br /><br />RE: davenothere&#039;s post about their business practice of taking advantage of their employees -- honestly I wouldn&#039;t know what to say because (A) for me it&#039;s just hearsay and (B) it doesn&#039;t sound like you did anything back when you were informed.&nbsp; Unless I&#039;m wrong and you spoke to the owner what good would saying something now do when there&#039;s no real proof?&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying you did the wrong thing or that you should have done something... but what do you expect customers to say without sounding stupid?&nbsp; &quot;Oh awhile ago someone online became friendly with your employees, who no longer work for you, but those employees said you were dishonest?, unethical? and I wanted to say, please don&#039;t do that&quot;.&nbsp; See what I mean davenothere?&nbsp; What is it you think people can say?

					Was looking for a Vegetarian restaurant in the neighborhood other than Dosa Delight.&nbsp; And I know all the Indian restaurants serve vegetarian dishes but I wanted to try someplace new.&nbsp; Ended up here for lunch today.&nbsp; Before ordering I read reviews on yelp so decided to have a Dosa.&nbsp; On yelp someone had a mix of spinach and potatoes which wasn&#039;t on the menu so I asked and they graciously accommodated me.&nbsp; It&#039;s the first time I had a Dosa that wasn&#039;t already filled when brought to the table (like the buffet at the Jackson Diner) and I was so happy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always hated this big shell with stuffing only in the middle.&nbsp; It was light and crisp; I liked tearing it apart and spooning on my filling and sampling first the orange sauce -- never saw or had before --and it was mildly spicy and delicious.&nbsp; Next I sampled the coconut sauce (maybe what they called coconut chutney?).&nbsp; I LOVE coconut flavor so this was also wonderful.&nbsp; The sambar tasted like a light tomato broth lentil vegetable soup.&nbsp; I liked it a lot.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t expect to get full since there wasn&#039;t rice with the Dosa but after I ate EVERYTHING I was perfectly full.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to go back and try a other dishes.&nbsp; The interior was clean, bland but pleasant.&nbsp; The front cases that JHlifer mentioned were empty and looked like they would be for desserts.&nbsp; It certainly wouldn&#039;t bother me at all if they had a vendor selling their desserts as a compliment to the restaurants food but honestly, since they were empty I have no idea what the deal is there.&nbsp; eddiestjohns I was surprised to see you didn&#039;t like the idea since it&#039;s not like the restaurant was divided into different establishments.&nbsp; The rents are so high in JHs if this helps a vegetarian restaurant stay in business I AM ALL FOR IT!&nbsp; &nbsp;(the photo looks like a potato dosa)

					I just saw this thread and all I can say is this supermarket is a welcomed addition to JHs.&nbsp; The fact that they have so much organic and green products is so damn wonderful I was practically vibrating with joy when I was inside.&nbsp; Then add to that the place is bright, clean, attractively decorated …. I can&#039;t think of anything negative to say because I&#039;m thrilled to have something like this here.&nbsp; To complain about one side of the building seems so damn petty to me.&nbsp; I guess some people will always find something to complain about.&nbsp;
