				The shop seems to be departing. There&#039;s a &quot;business for sale&quot; in the window, and the opening and closing times have gotten more and more iffy. i never really patronized the place much, since it&#039;s not my thing, but i know a lot of folks enjoyed it. just a heads up.

				Would honestly love to have a real ice cream place there in its stead. Something like Ample Hills in Astoria...good ice cream, old timey, etc. We&#039;re missing that in the neighborhood. That gross weird self-serve yogurt is definitely not my thing either!

				I thought the yogurt at Rainbowberry was inedible. The customer service was also bad. I’m not particularly surprised to see it closing. On the other hand, there used to be a few froyo places in Astoria that were good, and two have closed—16 Handles in 30th Ave and Red Mango on Steinway. So maybe it’s just a hard business to sustain.

				An old timey ice cream parlor would be cool, but I think it&#039;s difficult for those kinds of places to make it these days since the supermarkets sell countless brands and flavors.&nbsp; It used to be they only had vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and maybe spumoni.
