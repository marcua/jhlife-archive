				Apart from the usual arguments against chain stores, which this board and others have done to death:<br /><br />So, I&#039;m sure in planning this, the responsible authorities gave serious though to whenever a large chain opens outside of manhattan (and sometimes in manhattan), people assume that you can drive up to the front door and/or park.......<br /><br />RIGHT?<br /><br />Exactly what we need!

				They&#039;re calling this location Jackson Heights, however it seems to me they must be talking about Elmhurst. They mention that the site was previously a movie theater. Are they not calling it Elmhurst because Jackson Heights is a more recognizable brand? Or they are afraid if they call it Elmhurst that people will confuse it with the actual Target that already exists in Elmhurst near the mall?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Jackson Heights site previously housed a defunct 82nd Street movie theater that was purchased by the developers for $27 million last fall.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Edit - it looks like they are not the only ones calling that location Jackson Heights. When the sale happened of the theater (which I think was called Jackson something), DNA info posted an article calling it Jackson Heights as well. https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160922/jackson-heights/former-jackson-heights-movie-theater-site-purchased-for-27-million<br />(https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2014/01/jh-cinema-13897410663383.jpg/larger.jpg)

				I don&#039;t want stupid Target here. If I want a bunch of generic crap at a good price, and I definitely do sometimes, I just go on Amazon. At least with Amazon, I don&#039;t have to look at that suburban, generic branding. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t mind having to leave my neighborhood to go to crap like this. I buy my Levi&#039;s jeans at Macy&#039;s usually, and it takes about a 20 minute train ride. No big deal. <br /><br /><br /><br />And I don&#039;t think suburbanites will come here with cars to go here. It will be mostly local bc the suburbanites already have this wherever they are. We are becoming the suburbanites. All this is doing economically is taking money away from our own local economy and providing low-paying jobs that will sustain and keep people from not advancing their own careers in new directions. I hope it&#039;s a crap Target.

				You are right abc... We have loads of chain stores. Perhaps disinformation in the hope folks won&#039;t think it through. 82nd Street has always had a higher share of national chain stores, but its growing dramatically and with Target, now going south of Roosevelt.<br /><br />82nd Street is kind of an outdoor mall when it comes to shopping choices. Woudln&#039;t be so bad if it were confined to 82nd because folks already travel outside the neighborhood for these stores. Would be very bad, if it starts spreading to 37th, and I don&#039;t see anything that would stop it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16356.msg78313.html#msg78313">Quote from: abcdefghijk on May 01, 2017, 11:06:37 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Personally, I am glad we haven&#039;t been invaded by EVERY big brand store. <br /><br />We have enough...Wendy&#039;s, Burger King, MacDonald&#039;s, Gap, Banana Republic, Dunkin Donuts and Old Navy and Target (to come)... etc.<br /><br />Those stores make a neighborhood generic.<br /><br />So it&#039;s a good thing we are seen as a Latino/immigrant neighborhood.<br /><br />Which the majority is around here.<br /><br />Just look around on the street.<br /><br />And that&#039;s the reason we&#039;re more affordable (rent/real estate) than Brooklyn/Manhattan.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I am trying to see the positive developments that may come from this. I don&#039;t think this chain invasion would spill over to 37th for the most part. 82nd Street Partnership seems to really be courting them, though. Let&#039;s hope these chains contribute (monetarily and by pressuring the City) to improvements of the surrounding infrastructure: 82nd Street subway station needs improvements, tree pit improvements, potholes fixed faster... and also give the developers with many storefronts the ability to offer lower leases for some smaller, local shops (we can dream!).

				&nbsp;I&#039;m interested to see how Target changes the dynamics of that location. I really do see where people are coming from when it comes to big business infiltrating areas and putting Mom and Pops out of business. The thing is JH small business was on the path to decay way before we were a twinkle in Targets eye. Look at 37th ave with all the closed storefronts. This is not because of big corporations pushing out the little guys. Owners of these properties are asking ludicrous amounts of money per SQFT. In addition, let&#039;s not forget about the bureaucracy you have to go through in order to sell your first cup of Latte. Whether we like it or not JH is on the radar of big business (82nd Street) and the property owners are well aware of a possible big payday coming.&nbsp;

Do you really like the proliferation of 99 cent type stores? <br /><br />If we had decent stores and restaurants like those in Astoria, I would understand your horror that a large store is opening a mini mall in this area. But many of the stores in this area are are slummy. There are no first rate supermarkets, no decent bakery, the decent non-Boarshead delis are gone (previous italian and russia-polish delis). I have no real hope for decent stores in the Bruson building because they would have announced something by now. <br /><br />The Target store is very small compared to any other City Target I can find online.

				I&#039;ve spent nearly two years trying to get the location to be a school. <br />Ours has 2,000. A small, community school with shops at ground level and both Donningham park and Manuel Unaue Triangle bordering it would have been nice. <br />You&#039;d think it wouldn&#039;t be such an odd idea, given the 155% overcrowding at the nearest school, PS 89, or the fact that Council Member Dromm is chair of education committee, with at least 7 schools in D24, which is the location, ELMHURST, having well over 1200 students. <br /><br />Council Member Ferreras-Copeland has built schools, but not enough. She spear-headed a committee on over-crowding which is impossible to find. <br />In January, the two of them hosted a City Council hearing on school siting- to review and challenge School Construction Authority on their methods of locating schools. They even went a step further to create a committee of legislators and advocates to tackle this. <br /><br />In these years, I&#039;ve contacted Borough Presidents Education Chair,&nbsp; Council members, our superintendent, the CEC and more. In recent months, I was told it was being negotiated for a school. <br /><br />So, from this perspective, property values, shopping choices, and gentrification all fall in line behind the fact that no one is really looking out for the well being of this community. Sure, let&#039;s add the lack of shopping comparable to Astoria- I&#039;m often stunned that this community can&#039;t support that kind of business. <br /><br /><br />

Hasn&#039;t it always been a middle class neighborhood? I think you could make a compelling argument that in the historic district, where one bedrooms are being listed now at +$300K, the middle class might no longer be able to afford the neighborhood since median income in NYC is $50K.

				Jackson Heights wasn&#039;t always gentrified just because many of the original buildings were coops.&nbsp; Those coops were built on empty land.&nbsp; To me, gentrification is the displacement of one neighborhood population by another, more affluent population.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost always preceded by a rise in home/rental prices.&nbsp; Just look at the most recent posting in the &quot;Real Estate and Home Improvement&quot; section.&nbsp; It lists JH coop sales that topped $900,000 with two over one million!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, in my humble opinion, bodegas and 99 cent stores are just the same old mom and pop stores we always had, only the owners look different.&nbsp; We used to have five and dimes that sold the same goods as the 99 cent places.&nbsp; We had corner delis and candy stores.&nbsp; We had places like Ferns on 74th Street which I loved, but was more schlocky than upscale.&nbsp; Do we need a dozen 99 cent stores, maybe not.&nbsp; But then again, if they all stay in business, then I guess there is enough demand.

				CaptainFlannel, I don&#039;t think your definition of gentrification holds up. Who are the real gentrifiers, middle-income earners who move to Jackson Heights because it is (was?) relatively affordable, or developers and landlords who wish to squeeze every last dollar they can from the neighborhood, whatever the consequences? Are the former, priced out of Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn, expected to only live in suburbs?<br /><br />And dssjh, I don&#039;t see &quot;young-to-middle-aged upper-middle class white folks of no discernible ethnicity&quot; as our neighborhood&#039;s most visible consumers of McDonalds, Foodtown, CVS, Chipotle, Taco Bell, Gamestop, Payless, or any other national chains. And I don&#039;t see them as the primary shoppers at this upcoming Target either.<br /><br />

Middle and lower-class immigrant and multi-ethnic communities find value in many of the things that generational middle- and upper-middle-class denizens take issue with. I can promise you a majority of the people who live in Jackson Heights/Elmhurst will be delighted to have a Target in such close proximity. Simply because they cater to one&#039;s everyday needs at affordable prices. And dare I say, provide validation as a staple retailer of the middle-class. Those affordable prices are what make that climb a little easier. When faced with the choice of an easier path into the middle-class for myself and my family, versus a more curated neighborhood retail experience, the former will win every time.<br /><br />I&#039;m speaking from experience as (1) a brand strategist who&#039;s spent years working on retail and consumer packaged goods brands (groceries, home supplies, etc.), but also as (2) an upper-middle class brown person who came from a middle/lower-middle-class family. When I was growing up, my family ONLY shopped at places like Caldor, Pathmark/Foodtown, and yes, Target. That&#039;s because they had what we needed to live our lives. The &quot;vibe&quot; of the neighborhood hardly registered on the list of importance.<br /><br />While that mindset is still true for my parents, I&#039;d say that it&#039;s no longer the case for me. Thanks to their contributions, I&#039;ve been able to climb higher on that ladder, and am now poised to own property. A first for my family. My mother — a native New Yorker, who worked as an overeducated social worker in Brooklyn and The Bronx — was driven out of Sunnyside, and New York in general, by unaffordable rent prices. So, I&#039;ve seen the effects of rising living costs firsthand. <br /><br />But I think we&#039;re lying to ourselves if we didn&#039;t acknowledge that there&#039;s a large group of people — most likely the majority who are not on this forum — that appreciate the opportunity that businesses like Target bring. If I&#039;m not in the middle class, the prices at places like Target help me get there; and by shopping with them, I already feel like I am.

				MrPlaza is why I come to this board. Smart, insightful comments about our (evolving) neighborhood.&nbsp; Thank you.<br /><br />I would also like to throw this into the mix: a store like Target <strong>will hire more employees </strong>than a typical store does.&nbsp; Many of the family-owned stores in JH understandably hire family first.&nbsp; &nbsp;More hires also come in part because of another benefit: longer hours.&nbsp; Check out the hours for a comparable store in Forest Hills: Mon-Fri 7am to 10pm. Sat 8am-11pm. Sunday 8am to 10pm.&nbsp; The working class, the working poor, and let&#039;s face it, the average New Yorker, works LONG HOURS and will benefit from having a store open those hours.<br /><br />The reality is that theater space sat empty, boarded and blighted for years at this point and having another economic engine chugging in our neighborhood will lift retailers of all stripes.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I certainly am not opposed to Target in JH. I actually go to target in Flushing at least once a week. I just think this is a waste of space. The Forest Hills location is a mishmash of stuff. They really do not have much of anything. I don&#039;t foresee this location&nbsp; bringing throngs of folks to our area. 82 Street has always had franchises for as long as I can remember. Woolworth&#039;s, KB toys, that bed bath and beyond type store (I forget the name), ABC&#039;s etc. I don&#039;t recall it ever being an area with Mom and Pop type stores. I wonder what other retail options will be there. I am still dreaming of a whole foods and trader joe&quot;s but when that happens we will probably be retired in Florida.

				Great points. My concerns are that once the big box comes in, it will never go back to being a locally owned place.<br /><br /><br />Also at issue is the accumulation of money. When there is a family run place, the family can accumulate money. Most employees of the Target store is won&#039;t accumulate much.<br /><br /><br />The longer hours thing is going to make the neighborhood safer, though. Also going to be better for street vendors in that area.

				Let&#039;s all admit that the 82nd St. BID is a failed organization. <br />That Seth Taylor was forced out in 2014, was a sure sign that the group was doomed. <br />How does NoHo look these days? That&#039;s where he went. He left 82nd and went to NoHo. <br />From an old article, he came to JH/Elmhurst with this experience:<br />Taylor worked in several BID&#039;s around the city, including the 34th Street Partnership and Bryant Park Corporation, the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership and the Union Square Partnership.<br /><br />All of the concerns, issues mentioned on this thread could have been better dealt with under proven leadership of a strong BID. The whole organization was hacked to pieces over the 2014 expansion, and its time to safely assume that the Queens Neighbors United group was a pre-cursor to the Trump presidential win. <br /><br />It looks like the BID webpage hasn&#039;t been updated in a year or so. Also looks like it&#039;s a staff of two and some street cleaners. (thanks, street cleaners!) <br />I&#039;d be really interested in attending a meeting of that board, to see what their longterm plans are, especially what the effects of Target will be on traffic, and the other businesses on 82nd. Are they going to close Associated and the Laundrymat? Both of those are enormous spaces that are absolute plusses for the neighborhood. <br />I put a call in to the BID, it hasn&#039;t been returned. <br /><br />http://www.82ndstreet.org/board-of-directors/<br />82nd Street Partnership<br />37-06 82nd Street, Suite 309<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br />Ph.

				<br />It&#039;s a tough discussion. And one that has long plagued my wife and I, as we grew up asking ourselves, &quot;Where do I belong?&quot;<br />[/quote]<br /><br />You belong to whatever group you associate with, and to every group that exists.&nbsp; Despite what&#039;s going on in this country, we all &quot;belong&quot; to each other, and there&#039;s no need to feel excluded based on anything, most of all working hard and doing better than the generation before you.<br /><br />Look, I don&#039;t know much about what constitutes &quot;gentrification,&quot; nor do I care.&nbsp; When my family first came to America, I was 5.&nbsp; We lived (and I grew up) in Astoria, and my immediate family still lives there.&nbsp; Over the years, I&#039;ve lived in the West Village, the east Flatiron district and the East Village.&nbsp; Each time, I am sure I displaced someone who made less than me.&nbsp; Each time, I was displaced by someone who made more than me (or I just wanted to save money and not throw it away paying rent every month).&nbsp; Did I &quot;gentrify&quot; the East Village?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; Is the East Village safer and more expensive today, and are the shopping options higher end, than when I lived there?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, I look at any change in our business district as an improvement over what it was 12 years ago - a vast array of money transfer stores, cell phone shops, really bad take-out, cheap clothes and dirty chain drug stores.&nbsp; Our restaurants have improved on decore and cleanliness (thanks, in large part, to the ratings, but also because newcomers tend to go after the newer looking restaurants);&nbsp; we have clothing stores where I can go and buy stuff to wear as business casual clothing;&nbsp; and our Duane Reade/Rite Aid is actually pretty decent and well kept.&nbsp; There&#039;s still room for improvement, but even in nice parts of Brooklyn, the opening of a Target didn&#039;t kill the independent businesses.&nbsp; Instead, walk a couple of blocks away and you&#039;ll see them flourish.

				The problem with the discussion of gentrification is that often the people that complain about it the most are the cause of it in the first place.&nbsp; People want to move into a neighborhood and then they don&#039;t want it to change.&nbsp; But often their moving in has changed the demographic/economic feature of it.&nbsp; I know people who have grown up in JH and moved away.&nbsp; They moved up economically from their parents and now have moved into neighborhoods and displaced others.&nbsp; There is no real right or wrong in this debate.&nbsp; Change is driven by economic forces.&nbsp; Realtors, landlords, property owners want the most money they can get for their property.&nbsp; NYC has always been a city of change -- good &amp; bad.&nbsp; JH was once an upper middle class neighborhood until it was overdeveloped and the Irish and Italian immigrants moved in.&nbsp; And they were displaced by Latinos and South Asians.&nbsp; We are again in another era of transition.&nbsp; Where this will take us we don&#039;t know yet.&nbsp; The people who are moving in will form it&#039;s nature.&nbsp; I see many Chinese and other Asians moving into our neighborhood.&nbsp; Will we look more like Flushing?&nbsp; We also have more transplanted Brooklynites.&nbsp; Will we look more like Greenpoint?&nbsp; Will the Latinos stay or move out?&nbsp; My only concern is that we remain diverse and not overwhelmed by one ethnic group or another.&nbsp; I like variety.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t want an all Flushing or all Greenpoint or all Spanish Harlem.&nbsp; I&#039;d like them all here.&nbsp; Together.&nbsp; I&#039;d like the working class and the upper class.&nbsp; But this is all out of anyone&#039;s control really.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see.&nbsp; It&#039;s an adventure.&nbsp;

				Ah, the Plaza on 82nd St- Donningham Triangle. <br />Well, it underwent over a $500,000 renovation last year. Due to lack of interest from contractors, they couldn&#039;t bid it out and it took months longer. <br />There are no benches, true- Know why? The fear of homeless and junkies from Elmhurst Hospital dirtying it up. I walk by there frequently and its a bane of my existence knowing that. <br />The flip side is that there are tables and chairs to be placed in that spot- I saw a group of men setting them out one day last year. One day only. I believe its the partnerships responsibility to put out the tables and chairs. Or they need a sponsor group, I think that&#039;s what Diversity Plaza has. It&#039;s worth a phone call.

				I remember a few days some years ago when the chairs and tables were set on the surrounding sidewalk which was relatively pleasant. Also one year when they had them at that triangle by the 90th Street station - not much esthetically but a welcome chance for a few minutes sit down. Could do with some street benches above 82nd Street on Roosevelt but I don&#039;t know whose bailiwick that would fall into.<br /><br />Was admiring the lovely clumps of iris now blooming in the post office garden, and love the azaleas.

				Thanks for this. I&#039;ll be there. <br />As I walk by practically daily, I just can&#039;t imagine a Target on that spot. How will the trucks move thorough two separate triangle intersections? Will loading block access to the Elmhurst ER for ambulances, or will loading take place on 82 pretty much closing the street to through traffic. <br /><br />What about the garbage both residential and commercial that will have to do daily pickups for the store and businesses itself? <br /><br />UPK- This was in the plan though never mentioned publicly. <br /><br />Will Donningham Triangle and Manuel de Unanue Triangle now be simply wiped out? <br /><br />Will the laundromat, grocery store and drug stores be forced to close due to the Target rider? <br /><br />What a horrible mess, all for a hair brush, a large container of cashews or cheap clothing. WHEN...there is a bigger target less than a 20 minute walk a way. <br /><br />Major fail for past and future politicians who call it progress.

				Here&#039;s an update and call to action from Newtown Civic Association. <br />It&#039;s very upsetting that now the developers want to add additional floors, for tax abatement. Housing on top of that monstrosity which will be loading zones and trash is a very bad idea.&nbsp; <br /><br />As Elmhurst&#039;s local civic, we at the Newtown Civic Association would like to inform you of a new development that will be happening in your community. The new development is set for 40-31 82nd Street Elmhurst which was the location of the former Jackson Theater. The Jackson Theater was demolished last year and the developers are moving ahead with their plan but are now asking for a zoning variance to build additional floors of housing. <br />Currently the zoning is R6 with a Commercial overlay of C1-3 and as of right their plans are 2 floors of commercial/retail and basement of retail along with 7 floors of market rate housing. They are asking for additional floors of housing which is said to be &quot;affordable&quot; but at what rate and affordable to who? They will receive tax incentives because of this. Also please note, they promised a community center in this development but has not reached out to any groups or organizations of the Elmhurst community and is not transparent with what the community center will be used for! Please write an email voicing your concerns to our local Community Board 4.<br /><br />Some more problematic examples are: <br />The continued overcrowding of our community, the stress on our overcrowded schools and the affects on our children, the stress and overabundance to our infrastructure, the very small street which it is located has already constant traffic overflowing from Roosevelt Avenue, 82nd street and all the side streets, the driving force of &quot;luxury development&quot; will drive up prices in an already high priced community, the nearby small businesses will suffer, this will all affect the character of the community with our small businesses and low density structures on 82nd Street, and lastly how many malls/retail does Elmhurst need? We have Queens Center Mall, Queens Place Mall that already has a Target and now another Target in Elmhurst on 82nd Street! <br /><br />***Please include any other concerns you may have and send a email to your local Community Board 4 at QN04@cb.nyc.gov or a letter to: Community Board 4&nbsp; &nbsp;46-11 104th St, Corona, NY 11368 <br /><br /><br />The Meetings About this Development: <br />There will be a rally by another group this Sunday February 25th organized by Queens Neighborhood United, which is being publicized on Facebook. It is from 11am to 1pm, 108-59 Roosevelt Ave. Here is their FB page, they have a post on this development&nbsp; https://www.facebook.com/QueensNeighborhoodsUnited/<br /><br />There will be a committee vote only on February 27th at the Community Board at the Queens Center Mall Community Room at 6:30pm. <br />It will come to the full board vote at a Public Meeting Tuesday, March 13th 7:00pm at Elmhurst Hospital Community Room. Testimony is from 7:00pm to 7:30pm for the public to speak about this development. Please attend. <br /><br />Thank you let is know if you have any questions. Remember this is your community, so speak up!<br />

I have been catcalled so many times walking past the public outdoor spaces in JH and Elmhurst. I say let them go.

				I&#039;ve said it before...<br /><br />But this neighborhood is what?&nbsp; &nbsp;75% immigrant?<br /><br />And immigrants love places like TARGET.&nbsp; Because TARGET is the American Dream.<br /><br />Target isn&#039;t for blase Americans seeking authentic experiences.<br /><br />The Jackson Heights&#039; Target will be for folks who came to this country, excited to experience exactly what Target promises. USA capitalism.<br /><br />And the numbers add up.&nbsp; Business-wise it&#039;ll be extremely successful. <br /><br />Whether American born folks on this forum shop there... or not.<br /><br />The market for TARGET is definitely the majority in this (and the Elmhurst)&nbsp; neighborhood.<br /><br /><br /><br />

It took me 30 minutes. It&#039;s not a walk I enjoy so I don&#039;t do it anymore; now if I go I take the 29 bus or if I&#039;m on the subway already I take the R train. I&#039;m surprised you can walk from a location in the historic district to Target in 18 minutes.<br /><br />I may not be the fastest walker in the world, but when I Google map my address to the Target Elmhurst address, it also tells me the walking time is 30 minutes so I don&#039;t think I can be that abnormally slow. 30 minutes to walk to a store like Target is just too much for me, when I find the walk somewhat unpleasant. I would rather take my 30 minutes on the subway and end up in Central Park where I can have a nice and beautiful walk.<br /><br />I also would really not enjoy the walk to the Flushing Target. I know that without ever having done it. It&#039;s not a pleasant route IMO. Also, just fyi, Google maps tells me the walking time from my apartment is 56 minutes to Target Flushing so I guess you and others who make it there in 30 minutes are walking a lot faster than the average person.

				I walk to the Target in Elmhurst when the weather is decent and I have a need. I try to walk to a lot of places that are only a couple subways stops away because I&#039;m healthy and fit enough to do so and I&#039;d like to keep it that way for as long as possible. It probably takes anywhere between 25-30 minutes.<br /><br />A tip for making walks in the city more pleasant is to get off the main thoroughfares as much as possible, and finding what&#039;s interesting in the neighborhood, which is rarely the commercial area.

				It&#039;s not so much the walk there as it is the walk back.&nbsp; I go to places like Target to purchase things, and lugging those things back can be difficult.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like walking to and from the proposed site on 82nd. <br /><br />I&#039;m just curious about what type of stores are welcome here.&nbsp; We seem to be against more pharmacies, more banks, more 99 Cent stores, chain stores, big box stores, cheap clothing stores.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the article cited in the other post on this proposal, people complain about how Target will put &quot;mom and pop&quot; stores out of business.&nbsp; But aren&#039;t 99 Cent stores and the small pharmacies that have been opening run by mom and pop.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind having a Target within realistic walking distance.&nbsp; I shop at the Gap and Banana Republic outlet stores.&nbsp; I also purchase items from 99 Cent stores.&nbsp; What is it the community wants?

The writing is on the wall. Less overheads and so cheaper price points. Plus international markets for any online store. That&#039;s why shops are attempting to create &quot;experiences&quot; to attract folks. That&#039;s also the future of retail (besides online).

				The whole thing is a joke. Politicians get to tell the public that they &quot;really gave it to those nasty developers&quot; by making them provide some affordable housing, but it&#039;s a complete joke. They get so many benefits beyond a single contribution from developers. I think what will ultimately bring the rents down is the overdevelopment of housing like in LIC and Manhattan. I have a sliver of hope that di Blasio knew what he was doing when he opened up the floodgates for new development.

				There is plenty of unique character on Roosevelt Avenue that is here to stay.&nbsp; The architecture along 82nd street (particularly on the block between 37th Avenue and Roosevelt) has the potential for something unique, charming and quite beautiful.

				These brand stores represent &quot;The American Dream&quot;.<br /><br />They project part of the reason immigrants move to America. Economic reasons.<br /><br />Charming, they ain&#039;t. Surburban, definitely.<br /><br />But they are VERY American. <br /><br />And in an immigrant neighborhood, these stores are aspirational.<br /><br />Hence the long lines along 82nd Street just to get inside that Target.<br /><br />And as Rita Moreno sings in the film version of West Side Story, &quot;I want to live in America&quot;.<br /><br />That&#039;s the history of immigration in NYC. And thus the story of Jackson Heights.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				For me, Target is good for cleaning supplies, cereal, office supplies and holiday-related stuff.&nbsp; When it comes to perishable goods, like fruits/veggies, dairy, and medicines, I will forever support Mango Rico and other local grocery stores (cheaper and fresher) and chain drug stores (yea, I know, just more convenient for me most of the time).&nbsp; <br /><br />I believe the long line is just a novelty and shall die down once people realized there&#039;s really nothing &#039;special&#039; sold inside. However, I am glad Target is bringing employment to the community.
