Pit bulls may or may not bite more than other breeds depending on the location. But they are MUCH more likely to inflict serious injuries or death than other breeds when they do attack.<br /><br />The argument over pit bulls is very much like gun owners with assault rifles. The vast majority of assault rifle owners are law abiding and no threat to the public. The few that go off then have the ability to inflict maximal damage because they have a highly efficient machine of death.&nbsp; A pit bull is like a gun owner with an AR-15 assault rifle...benign until they are attacking you.

				then again, a big white German Shepherd isn&#039;t a pit bull. <br /><br />suggesting &quot;no dogs allowed&quot; is a different discussion - and there&#039;s merit to that, given the confined space and jumpy natures of some dogs (and some people).

				The market is at a park, what are the rules for dogs in parks? <br />A pit-bull owner felt inclined to take his dog, off-leash into the P.S. 69 school yard last week while scores of kids were playing. I moved the children I was with. I bit my nails, tweeted and 311&#039;d the cops, and finally, I spoke to the owner. <br /><br />I said dogs were not allowed, and especially dogs off-leash. <br />He said he&#039;d put the leash back on &quot;for me&quot; . <br /><br />I was raised to be afraid of dogs, and I resent it. I love dogs now. <br />But, that fear is real, and based on poorly trained dogs. <br /><br />So, I support the existing laws about dogs. That being said, every dog owner should know and respect these rules.The pitfalls are in Travers all the time, especially by the handball courts.

				Below is the official word from the greenmarket website. I would just add that the JH greenmarket is one of the most congested markets I&#039;ve been to. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s due to the way the space is set up or if it&#039;s the sheer volume of the people visiting. Of course the Union Square market is crazy busy as well but there is far more space there in general. I personally don&#039;t think the JH market is the best place to bring a dog, but I guess the rules don&#039;t prevent it. So...<br /><br /><strong>May I bring my dog to Greenmarket?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Most Greenmarkets are outdoors in public spaces, as such the presence of dogs and the responsibilities of dog owners are governed by NYC law. Mindful dog walkers with well-behaved, leashed dogs, are welcome in our outdoor markets.&nbsp; If you bring your dog, ensure he/she does not &quot;mark&quot; inside farm stands, and remember it can be a challenge to walk a dog in crowds and the tight spaces between tables.</strong>

				There is a lot to unpack here. <br /><br />First of all, pit bulls are not a breed, but rather a nebulous grouping of dogs based on certain shared physical characteristics.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pit bulls are NOT more aggressive than any other dogs. dogsbite is full of actual garbage &quot;statistics&quot; - basically they cull info from newspapers without realizing or caring that: (a) papers frequently misidentify the type of dog and have a bias to identifying almost any dog as a &quot;pit bull&quot; that bears even a slight resemblance to one, (b) when you take into account that the label &quot;pit bull&quot; comprises 4 or 5 breeds, they are as likely to attack as any other randomly grouped set of 4 or 5 breeds, and (3) that newspapers are significantly more likely to report on pit bull attacks than other type of dog attacks. Basically, it&#039;s all confirmation bias. <br /><br />The notion that pit bulls are more dangerous than other types of dogs has been refuted by the ASPCA (https://www.aspca.org/about-us/aspca-policy-and-position-statements/position-statement-pit-bulls) and the Humane Society (https://blog.humanesociety.org/wayne/2014/07/pit-bulls.html), among other reputable groups. <br /><br />If you are afraid of big dogs, just say that. Pit bulls are actually considered to have a temperament on par with labs. This is not to say that pit bulls never attack, but rather that labs DO sometimes attack - because they are animals. And animals are individuals. <br /><br />This is a pretty good overview: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steffen-baldwin/the-lies-damn-lies-and-st_b_8112394.html<br /><br />The bigger problem is off-leash dogs, which is mostly an issue with small dog owners. That doesn&#039;t mean we should go ahead and ban all small dogs. <br />

				While riding my bike this afternoon, a cocker spaniel ran out into the street and chased me.&nbsp; (This is not the first time this has happened.)&nbsp; I sped up hoping to outrace the dog, but when I looked back he was getting awfully close.&nbsp; This little guy was fast as the wind!&nbsp; I heard the dog&#039;s owner screaming to &quot;stop.&quot;&nbsp; In the moment, I thought she was calling for the dog to stop, but after the incident was over, I realize she was probably screaming for me to stop as she feared the dog could be hit by a car.&nbsp; In the end, I believe we all survived.&nbsp; I was able to outrace the dog and when I looked back, it looked like the cocker spaniel had given up and was on his way back to his owner. This all happened in Forrest Hills.&nbsp; Perhaps we should ban all dogs from Forrest Hills?&nbsp; Or, at the very least, speedy cocker spaniels!<br /><br />Guess I&#039;ll just have to run down to the market, grab my tomatoes and apples and run back home!

The number of breeds called &quot;pit bull&quot; is completely irrelevant; what matters is the number of <em>dogs,</em> relative to the number of incidents. If labrador retrievers are really as dangerous as pitbulls, then the number and severity of lab injuries vs. pit injuries should be in the same ratio as the number of labs vs. pits. But that&#039;s clearly not the case, right?<br /><br />As for media bias, it might well be true that pit bull attacks are more likely to be reported (or it might not), but deaths are going to be reported no matter what, right? The CDC stats say 75% of fatal dog attacks were from &quot;pit bulls.&quot; Are pit bulls 75% of dogs?<br /><br />The better argument is that dogs <em>in general</em> are very rarely dangerous unless specifically trained to be, so the &quot;most dangerous dog breed&quot; is still not really anything to worry about. Personally I love those dogs and I agree they&#039;re mostly friendly goofballs, and I think it&#039;s heartbreaking how people don&#039;t want to adopt them. But I also think it&#039;s understandable that people are wary, when advocates do such a poor job of refuting the danger.<br /><br />(Also, I agree leash laws are important, but I never see dogs off leash around JH.)
