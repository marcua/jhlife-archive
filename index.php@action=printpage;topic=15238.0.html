It&#039;s really unfortunate because there&#039;s lots of interesting places that could open up there right now, and they could also be making money at the same time. But may eventually be rewarded for this tactic if the L Train/Cornell effect comes to fruition. As they say, greed is good.

The neighborhood could easily support multiple gyms...the situation has almost become dire considering the satanic conditions at Blink Fitness.

				I wish we could get a good gym there. One with towel service, group fitness classes, a spin studio, yoga, etc.. I believe Crunch runs a two pronged model -- one level is the corporate owned gyms which are really, really, nice; the others are franchises. I wish an entrepreneur interested in opening a gym saw a way to make profit in JH with Crunch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, NYSC, which is more budget friendly, really over expanded. I don&#039;t think NYSC has opened a new gym in the outerboroughs in quite some time.

				To be successful, a business does not need to be affordable to *everyone* in a neighborhood. It needs to be affordable and valueable to enough people to make a profit. The equation on whether or not a full service gym would have enough demand in this neighborhood to make a profit involves a lot of factors, and I suspect the rent the business would have to pay is the biggest factor<br /><br />JH is a neighborhood where one-bedroom coops in a post war building are going for $250K+. It&#039;s not a poor neighborhood.<br /><br />Full service gyms aren&#039;t nearly as expensive as people think they are. Crunch in Greenpoint costs about $20/month plus annual fee on a month-to-month plan, giving members access to other &quot;Essential&quot; locations (which I think means the non-fancy pants locations), classes, online nutrition, tanning, hydro-massage services, etc. NYSC offers month-to-month plans for a single location for $29/month plus an annual fee. I&#039;m a former NYSC member Sunnyside location, and they ran promotions frequently where you could lower that monthly rate.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d gladly pay $20-30 dollars a month for a gym with towel service and that offers this kind of class schedule since I&#039;m the type who is way more likely to go to the gym if I have an actual instructor led class that starts at a specific time. https://www.crunch.com/content/pdfs/Greenpoint_Fall_0906161236.pdf (https://www.crunch.com/content/pdfs/Greenpoint_Fall_0906161236.pdf)

				Yeah, I wonder about the money laundering thing too--I keep hearing about the high commercial rents.&nbsp; &nbsp;And then see places that are empty all day and night.&nbsp; How can that possibly work?

				I&#039;d love to know how much money the Bruson building spends on electricity.&nbsp; There has been absolutely no noticeable movement on this building for nearly a year and during that time the lights have been on 24 hours a day 7 days a week.&nbsp; I live nearby and the brightness at night has taken quite a bit of getting used to when trying to sleep (yes, I do have window shades).&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping they get tenants soon who have to pay their own electric bills and decide to turn the lights off at night like normal people.
