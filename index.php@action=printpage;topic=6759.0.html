				so last night, roomie and i were walking down 77th street near 35th, when we spotted a small, but seemingly full grown pure white cat. looks clean and reasonably well fed. she followed us down the street, asked for petting and attention, but wouldn&#039;t come in.<br /><br />today, my neighbor, who saw me tending to the cat, rang my bell at about eight am, and told me when she opened the front door, the cat just walked in ... and followed her to my door.<br /><br />have her here, quarantined in a room, and planning to take her to vet monday morning. i don&#039;t think we can keep her due to other animals in house. but hoping someone might know who lost her (or, and i hope this isn&#039;t the case, abandoned her).<br /><br />anyone have any ideas???

				so as i sit here with this lovely little cat, my falling in love with her is mixing with the desire to do some serious harm to the organism that abandoned her. &quot;person&quot; is too strong a word. a human wouldn&#039;t do this to an innocent little creature....or any of the other innocent little creatures in this thread that were tossed aside as if they were as unworthy of life as those that abandoned them.<br /><br />if anyone here has a defense for the two-legged organisms in question, i&#039;d love to hear it. i need something to mock today.
