			Help, my 1-2 year old red tabby ran out my back door this AM. He is red with small white feet, solid red face, white chest and white on the underneath. He is friendly and fixed.He may have 1 hot pink tip tip left on one of his nails. He is a smooth shorthair and was last seen on 85th street, 35th Ave to Northern.<br />Call 718 507 4209 or email: richieforren @yahoo.com

			I live on 86th and 34th and walk my dog around the block so I will look for him.&nbsp; Also try both Vets: the one on 37th bet. 86/85th Streets and the one on 35th by 71st.&nbsp; People who find strays tend to go to Vets and post on their boards.<br /><br />I hope you find him.<br /><br /><br />

			HURRAY!!!!&nbsp; I love happy endings.&nbsp; You might want to put a tiny tag with your name and phone number on a collar just in case he decides to go &quot;out walking&quot; again!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />My dog ran away from a dog sitter a few months after I had him and the only reason I got him back was the tag.&nbsp; I cried until he was brought back.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy for you.
