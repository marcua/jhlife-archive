				I wish NY1 and all other media sources would double check before reporting. That bar(40-08 74st) is on the Elmhurst<br />side of Broadway and not in Jackson Heights. I don&#039;t know why google maps shows that address as being<br />in Woodside(11377). The Woodside border is 72nd St over there. It makes you wonder though how many incidents<br />like this go unreported, it&#039;s a shame that some people don&#039;t know the meaning of &quot;live and let live.&quot;

				Thanks for the advice about being careful.&nbsp; I know it came out of neighborly concern.&nbsp; I will reiterate your point but with a few caveats.&nbsp; I want to be clear I am not blaming the victim for not taking precautions.&nbsp; Too often, victims, especially of gender- and sexual orientation-based violence, get blamed.<br /><br />Regardless of the motivation behind the incidents, I think everyone has the right to live in his or her community without the threat of violence at any hour.&nbsp; It is a sad state--that has unfortunately existed in many areas of this country to varying degrees at varying times--that people need to cautioned to walk outside.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to normalize such a situation.<br /><br />Having said that, these incidents have a dimension that others do not, namely the element of hate and intimidation directed at not just an individual but a whole group.&nbsp; Let&#039;s address the underlying issues.&nbsp; One observation that I have made is the sheer boldness of the machismo out there and the general acceptance among some people.&nbsp; What does it say when thousands of our neighbors vote for Hiram Monserrate AFTER his conviction and other troubles?<br /><br />Also, what about all the anti-gay words I hear in Spanish walking in this neighborhood?&nbsp; I just heard another one on Roosevelt Avenue tonight, probably directed at me.&nbsp; The Colombians who live in my building have similarly used derogatory terms toward me and seemed shocked when I confronted them.&nbsp; The use of the terms may be as racially motivated--my background is northern European--as they are motivated by perceived sexual orientation.&nbsp; As my Spanish improves, so does my awareness of the depth and breadth of the problem.&nbsp; I am not pinning all the blame on a certain group.&nbsp; I have lived in many different places and homophobia manifests itself in different ways in each place.&nbsp; There are non-Spanish-speaking people here who are also homophobic.&nbsp; I am pointing out the issue that has made itself most obvious through my personal experiences in Jackson Heights.

				Thank you so much for your comment bryncellen. I always find it grating when people talk about crime in JH as if it were such a horrific neighborhood. Anti gay crime happens everywhere..and overall JH is a pretty gay friendly place to live.
