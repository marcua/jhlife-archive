The whole purpose for Community Boards is to encourage public participation. I&#039;m not sure why &#039;erospolitico&#039; posted this false information. Any resident is welcome at committee meetings. <br /><br />As explained on the Community Board website: <br />The City Charter provides the opportunity for community residents to participate on committees.&nbsp; <br /><br />Residents may join a committee by writing the Board Chair requesting membership, with the Chair appointing members after consultation with the committee chairperson. <br /><br />Public members may vote at committee meetings, with their votes tallied and reported separately.<br /><br />Public membership provides an opportunity to draw additional expertise, opinions, and manpower into community planning and governance. <br />And it helps recruit and train potential Board members. <br /><br />The public may attend all committee meetings. Non-member votes are tallied for information purposes and included in meeting reports. <br /><br />http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=1624 (http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=1624)

				Willsweeney-<br /><br />Thank you for the clarification.&nbsp; I also, was not aware that committee meetings were open to the public.&nbsp; <br /><br />But it seems that you can&#039;t just &quot;stop in&quot; at a committee meeting.&nbsp; You need to plan ahead, write the Board Chair, and then be approved by the Board Chair.&nbsp; In other words, you have to become a member of the committee.&nbsp;

I have attended many myself. If you simply want to <strong>attend</strong> a meeting of particular interest to you, you may do so without having to contact anyone or getting approval from anyone. If you want to <strong>join</strong> the committee, you need to contact the Board Chair. <br /><br />It is important to let everyone know that Community Boards are supposed to be completely transparent. There is nothing secretive about what the Community Board does. The purpose of a Community Board is to serve as the most local form of government and the most accessible.

				Spanishfish--<br /><br />I was puzzled by your post, because I thought that it had been approved.&nbsp; But then I checked over on the dog run thread, and &quot;lc1251&quot; did say that it would be very helpful if people show up to speak at the next CB3 meeting.&nbsp; Hmmm.<br /><br />If anybody does want to help push the dog run along, I suggest contacting lc1251 to ask about the current status.&nbsp; If you do want to talk in favor of the dog run (or 78th Street) at CB3, you need to &quot;register with the District Manager by calling (718) 458-2707 no later than 5:00 p.m. on June 18th 2008.&quot;&nbsp; You may speak on any topic.

				Hey, did anyone attend the CB&#039;s hearings last night? I&#039;m particularly interested in hearing about the discussion of the application for outside tables at La Nueva and the radio facility. <br /><br />Thanks!

				There&#039;s a summary of the January CB3 meeting at the Queens Gazette (http://www.qgazette.com/news/2009/0121/Front_page/014.html).<br /><br />This month, the Community Board endorsed the city&#039;s proposed bike parking regulations (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=749.msg14480#msg14480), as well as a new radio antenna atop the Mariott Hotel on Ditmas Blvd.<br /><br />But the big news comes at the bottom of the article...<br />&quot;Board 3 imposes term limits on its officers, and the time had come for Chairman Visantrai Gandhi to yield his office. Winning the election to replace him was Grace Lawrence. Marta Leverton succeeds her as first vice chair; Alfonzo Quierez is second vice-chair, and Darryl Hoss is treasurer.&quot;<br /><br />This seems potentially quite important.&nbsp; Does anybody know how this might impact the Community Board&#039;s priorities?
