				For everyone angered by Sen. Peralta&#039;s change of party affiliation: he is hosting a town hall discussion this Friday at 6 pm at the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, 37-06 77th St. Let him know how you feel.<br /><br />

				Much as I do not like his move to align with the GOP in the Senate, I find it fascinating how all these new accounts are popping up on this list with what appears to be one purpose.<br /><br />I have my own opinions here - including on yesterday&#039;s Facebook post where he declares this voting district a &quot;sanctuary district.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;On that note, since all of NYC is a sanctuary city, the proclamation amounts to nothing more than &quot;we won&#039;t disobey the orders of the Mayor and the City Council.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and make this one.&nbsp; Should be interesting.

				What is there to discuss?&nbsp; Other than letting him know he put himself above his constituents and I certainly won&#039;t be voting for him.

It seems designed to create a false sense of dialogue and transparency. He&#039;s already joined the IDC, and walked back on the agenda he campaigned on; it&#039;s not like that decision is up for review or debate. The damage is done -- and I am not interested in hearing PR talk about how he&#039;s going to push a more progressive agenda. My trust that he is able to represent this community is destroyed irreversibly.

				One hate to prejudge.. BUT<br />In times like this only the most out of touch politician representing Jackson Heights would align himself with Trump/Republican Party.&nbsp; As the saying goes.. actions speak louder than words, so judge our representative by what he has done rather than the spin he tries to put on it at some community meeting.&nbsp;

				To those neighbors interested:<br />Senator Peralta has agreed to hold a public forum for his constituents this Friday, February 3, 6-7:30 PM at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights, 7. Many of us have requested such a meeting so he can explain his decision to join the IDC.&nbsp; As many of us are deeply disappointed, this will be an opportunity to hear the Senator&#039;s side and to express our discontent.<br />And yes, I did just join JHLife to post this.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Senator has chosen not to publicize this event on his webpage, his Facebook, his Twitter, or via his large constituent email list, which makes many of wonder if this is a good faith effort on his part to be accountable and present to his constituency.<br />Please share widely.<br />

				It&#039;s not just Peralta.&nbsp; One thing to remember is the IDC exists as it does because Andrew Cuomo benefits from it and he&#039;s not nearly as progressive in practice as he would like us to think.

				Yes, I&#039;ve heard that. But we have a better chance of getting rid of the IDC senators than Cuomo.

				I asked Senator Peralta when and where the forum was going to be on his Facebook page.&nbsp; Found it weird that he or one of his people deleted my inquiry.&nbsp; &nbsp;What kind of public employee will not want to advertise that he is meeting with the people who HIRED him to REPRESENT us.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this post doesn&#039;t get deleted.
