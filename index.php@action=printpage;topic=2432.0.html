				i guess dumpster diving could be anywhere including restaurants. i&#039;m thinking bakeries and grocery stores. you know how it&#039;s most profitable for them to keep the shelves constantly stocked, well that means when new stuff comes in they just dump the &quot;old&quot; stuff, although which is it&#039;s perfectly fine. it&#039;s funny, in the second it moves from inside to outside, somehow we decided it&#039;s &quot;garbage,&quot; although one second ago we were paying money for it.

				I saw this on Oprah and one of the news shows. Apparently alot of people do it-including affluential folks. Is it for me no but I am all for not wasting-especially food. Im curious though what have you been able to recover from your dives?

				look up &quot;food not bombs&quot; for more info behind the thinking of dumpster diving...zyxy, you should focus on queuing people into WHY the should &quot;dumpster dive&quot; and the sort of impact that activity can have on the community... reclaiming edible food that is destined for the garbage is what NYC&#039;s city harvest program does in order to feed hundreds of hungry new yorkers... dive all you want, but be accountable...

				Dunkin donuts throws out there dougnuts but i dont know there schedule, and a bakery on nothern blvd and 81st street throws old hard bread out at 2ish 3ish in the morning (some water in a spray bottle and an oven will bring the bread back to normal lol) im not sure about the fruit stores but on 78th and 37th ave i forgot what day but produce is also thrown out. if your really going to do this i suggest you scope these establishments out so you can learn the garbage days and what is thrown out.&nbsp; best of luck.<br /><br />
