				throughout the 70s, especially 73/74, there are signs reading &#039;no honking, $350 fine.&#039; cars honk every 10 seconds. cars honk 10 feet&nbsp; away from lazy-@$$ police. if five percent of those breaking the law laid out on those signs, we would be RICH. if the signs are fake and the law is non existent, remove the signs. if the law is real, ENFORCE

				Although, on second thought, perhaps there is a certain percentage of the population that actually thinks twice about honking in a neighborhood with those signs displayed, whereas in another neighborhood they might lean on it hard whenever someone hesitates for half a second at the light.<br /><br />How would we know if those signs have any effect on that population of mostly law-abiding drivers?

				Probably the result of 311 calls about noise that the city felt it was &#039;doing something&#039; posting the signs.<br /><br />Years ago, I tried with my class to get a light put on Hillside Avenue by our school, where there is only one light per three blocks.&nbsp; After petitions, interviews, and three class projects, we got ...<br /><br />8 extra school crossing signs on our avenue, not Hilliside on our other side, and a 25 mph sign on Hillside.<br /><br />Signage = DOT&#039;s answer to everything .. :(

				There&#039;s an excessive amount of honking on my block.&nbsp; Over anything, really.&nbsp; A garbage truck, someone taking too long to park etc.&nbsp; It makes me want to fling water balloons out the window at the honkers sometimes! And I&#039;m on the fourth floor. <br /><br />I wish we had those signs! ;)&nbsp; Even if it caused one of those idiots to shut up!

				I did a Google search to see if there is list of where the signs are, and found this instead:<br /><br />http://www.stopthehonking.com/<br /><br />Not sure how effective it is/will be, but maybe if the whole zip code registered ??

				Honking is such a horrible problem here. Like Divanatrix I also live on a block where people (very often limo drivers) honk constantly. It is crazy! I&#039;ve filed maybe 2 dozen noise complaints with 311 and the response on ALL of them was: the officers did not find the conditions described.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o <br /><br />I signed the petition Really4Rob forwarded.

				I remember a few years ago their was a bill floating around that would mandate that the car horn would be just as audible inside the car as well as outside. The reasoning was that since horns are only allowed to be used in a EMERGENCY, the passengers of the car should be warned of the impending hit/crash/collision.&nbsp; That would cut down the horn blowing 99%. The bill never passed. &gt;:(&nbsp; My neighbor across the street would honk his horn every day at 5:30 pm as he pulled into his driveway to alert his family he was home. After calling 311 every day for a month at the same time, the 115th did have undercover cops wait for them one day. They were ticketed, and it did stop. Also the yellow school buses that honk to alert the parents that they were outside is also annoying. As are the cabs that honk to pick up passengers. I also agree that lack of enforcement is a big problem in this neighborhood.

				http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/nyregion/thecity/20fyi.html<br /><br /><strong>Shh (for What Itâ€™s Worth)</strong><br /><br />Q. <span class="bbc_u">I canâ€™t figure out how the city decides to put up â€œNo honkingâ€ signs, which in my opinion more neighborhoods could use. Can you explain how the system works?</span><br /><br />A. Horn-honking complaints and sign requests are made through 311, community boards and elected officials, said Michael Saucier, a spokesman for the cityâ€™s Department of Environmental Protection, the agency that pays for the signs. Offenders can be fined $350 for each offense.<br /><br />Mr. Saucier said the department studies the location for which a sign has been requested, considering such factors as traffic volume and the streetscape. If the agency decides that a sign is justified, the request is passed along to the Department of Transportation, which installs it.<br /><br />The Environmental Protection Department paid for about 200 no-honking signs in the year ended June 2005 and 500 signs for the year ended June 2006.<br /><br /><strong>Some side streets, like West 82nd between Broadway and Amsterdam, have more than one sign, creating the effect of a succession of wagging fingers. Elsewhere, it is clear that a sign, if it were to go up, might simply invite honks of mockery.</strong> <br /><br />For instance, the intersection of East 59th Street and Second Avenue, near the Queensboro Bridge, is predictably unpleasant as cars and trucks honk their way in and out of Manhattan. Rush- hour drivers are typically more restrained at 72nd Street and Second Avenue, where residents recently requested a sign.<br />

				I live on one of the worst streets for noise and honking (and trash) - 73rd.&nbsp; It seems like the honking has been a lot worse lately (now that I think about it, it was probably because of the weather and the slicker than usual streets).&nbsp; Hey, at least we won&#039;t have to deal with Mr. Softee trucks for a couple more months! <br /><br />A few weeks ago, a minivan was parked right under my window at 5 in the morning - he had his doors wide open, including his hatchback, and was blasting music - it was louder in my apartment than it would be if I had my stereo on.&nbsp; During a break between songs I yelled out the window for him to shut up, to no avail of course.&nbsp; I also heard a few other people yelling out their windows.&nbsp; The good part:&nbsp; all of a sudden I saw something flying through the air and then three eggs splattered the guy&#039;s van.&nbsp; He immediately shut the doors and took off.&nbsp; I know I can&#039;t condone that type of response, but at the time I was happy because I just wanted to get back to sleep.&nbsp;
