				A friend of mine was coming home late yesterday, around 2am, and stopped to get a falafel from the cart on 37th Ave near 80 or 81 Street.&nbsp; The guy asked if she had a boyfriend and started making vulgar hand gestures asking if he &quot;sexed her real good&quot; then grabbing and touching himself through his clothes.&nbsp; She&#039;d already paid so she simply left and hurried home.&nbsp; She said she was in such shock she wasn&#039;t sure what to do and if it was something worth reporting to the cops<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d put it out here for awareness and see if anyone else has had an obscene encounter with that particular cart. Also, does anyone have suggestions for anything she could still do now even though its a day later? Is there someone we could ask who could encourage an investigation of this particular vendor or something?

				Just report it to the police.&nbsp; This is a form of sexual harassment:<br /><br />http://venusgenus.com/is-street-harassment-a-punishable-crime-yes-it-is/<br /><br />http://www.ihollaback.org/<br /><br />I find many of the contributors on this blog are hesitant to say anything or do anything that might tarnish the &quot;image&quot;of Jackson Heights. (not speaking about the poster, I understand that this was a traumatic experience, I&#039;ve been through it myself)&nbsp; If you want to protect JH, do what it takes to keep it a safe, clean and desirable<br />&nbsp;place to live.&nbsp; You have a right to fight back against crime!!!&nbsp; Of course, JH has a lot of positive things to say for it, but please, won&#039;t people open their eyes?!!!&nbsp; You&#039;re not &quot;putting down&quot; JH if you criticize negative things that criminals may be doing here, you&#039;re being real!!!<br /><br />I would also report it to Dan Dromm&#039;s office He is aware of the uptick in sexual assault in JH and he really should be kept aware of these situations:<br /><br />http://council.nyc.gov/d25/html/members/home.shtml<br />

				There is a culture of misogyny in JH (just look at all those mannequins with nuclear proportions, sports bars, chica chica cards etc.) These things are not quaint and they certainly are not acceptable.&nbsp; I know that there is a first amendment issue but other working class neighbrohoods in Queens&nbsp; do not objectify and mistreat women to the degree you see around here.&nbsp; someone has to say:&nbsp; We are not playthings for your pleasure (like this pig did to the poor woman on this string.&nbsp; She just wanted a falafel.&nbsp; (Or she was just going to work.&nbsp; Or she was just picking up her kids...)<br /><br />From the Queens Tribune:<br /><br />A different groper in Jackson Heights <br />By Paula Neudorf | Posted: Thursday, August 11, 2011 7:25 pm <br /><br />â€œIf you have breasts, you get hit on. Thatâ€™s how this neighborhood is,â€ said Nicolle Loayza, 26. She was talking about Jackson Heights, where she was born and raised. A man accused of groping three women in the neighborhood on two different occasions is still at large.<br /><br />On the heels of these reports and a spate of separate groping incidents reported in Astoria and the Upper East Side, council members Julissa Ferreras (D-Corona) and Danny Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) stood on the corner of 90th Street and Roosevelt Avenue today to pass out fliers with the police drawing of the Jackson Heights groper.<br /><br />Yesterday, a different man, Jose Alfredo Perez Hernandez, was arrested for allegedly fondling several women on the Upper East Side, according to published reports. Hernandez is from Corona.<br /><br />Ferreras said she decided to canvass Jackson Heights today both because of the incidents that occurred in her district and because of Hernandez. â€œIs this the place where people come to hide?â€ she asked of Corona.<br /><br />While Dromm and Ferreras continued to pass out fliers, Loayza pointed to the spot across Roosevelt Avenue where she said men often wait just to look up womenâ€™s skirts when they climb the stairs to the 90th St. 7 train.<br /><br />She described the time a man grabbed her crotch a few blocks away when she was just 12 years old, and said men often follow her home from the train, catcalling her along the way. However, she has never reported a single incident.<br /><br />â€œIâ€™ve learned to deal with it,â€ she said. â€œYou just walk around the block and try to lose them.â€<br /><br />But Ferreras thinks this is precisely the problem.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s not just about shrugging it off or avoiding a corner,â€ Ferreras said.<br /><br />The number of incidents reported in Queens in the last two months might point to the increased comfortability women have in telling their stories because so many others have come out, said Emily May, the executive director of hollaback!, an organization that seeks to combat street harassment.<br /><br />â€œ[Groping] is not a rare occurence. This is more pervasive than we want to acknowledge,â€ May said.<br /><br />Dromm and Ferreras are encouraging women in their districts to continue coming forward.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s never all right to touch anyone in an unwanted manner,â€ Dromm said. He added that some residents of Jackson Heights and Corona, which are largely Hispanic neighborhoods, may be afraid to report harrasment to the police if theyâ€™re undocumented.<br /><br />â€œYouâ€™re not going to have problems with your immigration status if you report it,â€ he said.<br /><br />Loayza, a flier in hand, seemed to come to a realization about the harassment she has experienced.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s not normal that I think itâ€™s normal,â€ she said.<br />

				Thanks for letting us know.&nbsp; I pass that cart all the time.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be sure to steer far clear of the asshole.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it was up the night your friend was harassed, but there&#039;s a cop stationed at 37th and 81 street and I often see a few on the ground talking as well.&nbsp; She should definitely report this.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newbie here in Jack Hts and while I&#039;m still learning more about the area, I definitely get hit on a lot more here, followed home, catcalled, etc.&nbsp; It might be that I&#039;m female and Latina, who knows.&nbsp; And no, I don&#039;t dress provocatively.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter with these pervs.&nbsp; There are a fair amount of shops here with ridiculously proportioned mannequins and stripper clothing, as well as a fair amount of &quot;cabarets&quot; where you can pay girls to &quot;dance&quot; with you.&nbsp; Finding a &quot;massage&quot; isn&#039;t too hard either.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason I think of it as the red light district of NYC.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said, there&#039;s a lot to love about Jackson Heights and that&#039;s why I would stress the importance of reporting such harassment.&nbsp; We can avoid the guy, but he&#039;ll still be free to do it to the next girl.&nbsp; You do have a right to live without such harassment.&nbsp; Reporting the guy will help make Jack Hts a better place to live.

				I am female and have purchased food from that cart a few times.&nbsp; How stupid!&nbsp; This guy was taking a real chance of losing his business.&nbsp; I would have loved to see a picture.&nbsp; If I knew who it was, I would not hesitate to bring up the fact that his behaviour will cost him his business and that there is a forum in Jackson Heights that addresses such issues.&nbsp; I also imagine he has a partner who probably would not be too thrilled if he knew what this guy was doing.&nbsp; A cell phone picture and a call to the police right in front of him should do the trick.&nbsp; I would bet that faced with this he would be all over himself apologizing.<br /><br />By turning the tables we don&#039;t have to be victims.<br /><br />

				Funny how everyone has already jumped to the conclusion that this incident actually happened and the vendor is guilty of the accusation. I&#039;d be hesitant to condemn someone without evidence or even there being a police report filed. Or other reports of similar rude behavior.

				StevenGrey, this is an excellent point, and I definitely agree with you in principle.&nbsp; But there&#039;s a big difference between somebody we&#039;ve never heard of before coming to this board solely to make accusations, and a post from a longstanding member of this discussion board.&nbsp; I&#039;m more willing to take the latter case at face value.

				&nbsp; This is awful and though I wasn&#039;t there, it sounds like a number of other incidents of a lewd nature that involve the vendors. Some have involved<br />conversations of an overt sexual nature between some of the vendors and/or known customers while school children are waiting on line. I know<br />parents are sometimes cautious about sex education in public schools but what was discussed in several of these conversations overheard was<br />vile and explicit, in broad daylight, right on the street. I did complain directly to the vendor once but the explosive laughter as I left made me think it didn&#039;t do anything except provide more material for them. Needless to say, I have taken my business elsewhere. But I have observed a general disrespect for women and children from a number of vendors, almost as a dare to do anything about it. I think it&#039;s time they are held to a standard of decency and respect for their neighbors and customers. <br />&nbsp;Or we can take our dollars elsewhere.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s funny that people have &quot;jumped to conclusions&quot; about this local businessman.&nbsp; I think that people listened to this woman&#039;s story, found it credible, and urged her to report it to police and the authorities. Certain posters responded with sympathy and some empathy (catcalls, being followed or worse) that perhaps some posters cannot identify with.&nbsp; I apologize for my remark about the &quot;sports bars&quot;; I was referring more to the &quot;gentlemen&#039;s clubs&quot; with posters of near-naked woman in the windows.&nbsp; But I do not apologize for my personal observation that JH (among other places) has a culture of misogyny that encourages the objectification of women which encourages the attitude among some men that they can insult/assault women publicly.&nbsp; I think that the original poster&#039;s friend was simply traumatized by an event, and her friend asked for some guidance as to what she might do. I do think it&#039;s telling that the woman who had the experience &quot;was in such shock she wasn&#039;t sure what to do and if it was something worth reporting to the cops.&quot;&nbsp; I think that most women can identify with that feeling, that perhaps it wasn&#039;t a big deal and you wouldn&#039;t want to mar the reputation of a local businessman such as the alleged perpetrator of this event, the falafel vendor.&nbsp; I wish the original poster&#039;s friend the best.&nbsp; And yes, as I said before, I think it&#039;s worth reporting to the cops. (I usually don&#039;t eat street food so I won&#039;t be joining the boycott)&nbsp; I encourage women to vocal about incidents such as this one in the future.<br /><br />

				WOW!! Perhaps this is the reason Us women do not report everything? I highly doubt someone is going to come here to this board&nbsp; to simply mar someones reputation. &quot;Steven&quot; apparently you are a man- not a woman who has been sexually assaulted and or harassed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had my share of perverts throughout the years and unfortunately now my young teen daughters are going through the same thing. I don&#039;t think its right that we have to be afraid to walk down the streets (any time of day) to catcalls, groping, nasty comments and sometimes worse!!!

I was so shocked that I kept walking, got a the train then fell to pieces when I got to work.&nbsp; I had a man follow me onto the subway platform and harass me to the point where the under-cover cops arrested him (apparently they determined he was getting ready to hurt me).&nbsp; And for these two stories I&#039;m sure that many, many women, just average women going to work every day can echo with similar stories.&nbsp; So when a young women in JH has an experience like the one that inspired this string, I remember how I felt.&nbsp;

				Wow, thats traumatic, I&#039;m sorry you&#039;ve had such experiences!<br /><br />I have to say, I&#039;ve been catcalled only once in JH and that was in the low 90s and he wasn&#039;t threatening.&nbsp; In Park Slope I lost count, but there was one construction site that was most of the problem.&nbsp; In North Carolina and Georgia through? All the time - and being a car culture there were many times I felt threatened by dangerous maneuvers done by drivers trying to get my attention.&nbsp; Whether I was a pedestrian or driving another car.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if its just because I&#039;m older and no longer &quot;got it&quot; like before (kidding (I hope?)) but JH has been nothing like what I experienced in the suburbs.&nbsp; Men being unable to approach women in a respectful way is a problem everywhere but in my experience it definitely improved for me when I moved here.

				By the way, just so you all know my friend has reported the incident to Dromm&#039;s office.&nbsp; She said that someone had already contacted Dromm about it and they knew about her story so I have to assume that came from someone on here.

And please be aware of puritanical strains of thought that veer into down right fanaticism. Despite advertising and media at the end of the day we are all human beings responsible for our own actions. We&#039;re free to think anything we want about any woman who walks down the street, and yes being dressed provocatively DOES make that alot easier for men, but nothing allows anyone to make anyone else feel uncomfortable and unsafe through conversation or gestures.<br /><br />Just report this to the police. The police will go and question the vendor. Whether he did or didn&#039;t harrass this woman, guaranteed he will be more careful how he speaks to his female clientale lest he be visited again by another police officer. <br /><br />These guys aren&#039;t brazen criminals. They&#039;re petty low-lifes trying to get their kicks in whatever way they can. Shine a light in their face and they&#039;ll retreat like any roach. Stay quiet and they&#039;ll keep doing it.<br /><br /><br />
