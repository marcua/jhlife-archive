			<br />--- Quote from: Chuckster on February 07, 2008, 05:28:59 PM ---The South Bronx flavor is very spicy?&nbsp; Todd, do you mean spicy hot?<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />Yes, it has more pepper than you can shake a stick at (not that shaking a stick will help much in this situation).<br /><br />Here&#039;s the description from the 5 Boroughs website:<br />&quot;A deep, rich chocolate ice cream spiced up with a chipotle/habanero pepper blend, cinnamon, and scattered with semi-sweet chocolate chips that melt in your mouth. Gives â€˜hot chocolateâ€™ a whole new twist.&quot;<br /><br />As long as you know what you&#039;re getting into, it&#039;s quite yummy.&nbsp; But best eaten in combination with &quot;cooler&quot; flavors.

			The heat comes as a surprise at the end - and it packs a punch!<br />We have samples if you want a taste before you commit to a pint - just ask whoever is at the counter and they will give you a spoonful.<br />Julie

			Thumbs up on the Mangodesh!&nbsp; We were scraping the bottom of the container - should have gotten two.<br /><br />(edited to add that I asked the 5 Boroughs owners to add Espresso 77 to their retail locations list on their website and I see that they have now added it.)
