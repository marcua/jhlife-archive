				There&#039;s a lot of speculation about how the real estate market will be impacted by COVID-19. Personally, I think it will be impacted, but it will take some time for that to be clear. Real estate is slower to react than the stock market. <br /><br />I think this has potential to drastically change both the housing market and the commercial market. So many of our small businesses will be hurting soon, if they are not already. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a recent article on this topic: <br /><br />https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/10/21173411/coronavirus-new-york-real-estate-home-prices-covid-19 (https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/10/21173411/coronavirus-new-york-real-estate-home-prices-covid-19)<br /><br />What do you think? How will it impact Jackson Heights?<br /><br />

				It will hurt condo buildings, especially buildings where apartments were bought in order to rent out on Airbnb etc. Those apartment owners will have no cashflow now and may not be able to pay their mortgages or maintenance.<br /><br />I think it will hurt co-ops less. And since Jackson Heights is mostly co-ops and houses, it might not be so bad here...

				I completely agree with Matt that the Real Estate is slower to react then the stock market.&nbsp; We won&#039;t know what impact the financial markets will have on the real estate market until the 4th quarter.&nbsp; At this time its speculation and guessing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yes, of course it is speculation at this stage.<br /><br />But one fact is: the prices for a typical Manhattan house increased 62% in a run up of the 1929 stock market crash and then lost 51% of that value by the end of 1933.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I read an article about the Corona Virus Emergency Package...now being debated in Congress... that says there&#039;s a provision for real estate developers to use depreciation of property to offset tax on other income. (Their stock market income, for instance). <br /><br />So they are planning for a decrease in property values. <br /><br />However, my prediction is that everything will contract. Stock market, real estate you-name-it.<br /><br />Like I said before...maybe for 2-3 years until we recover from the current crisis.<br /><br />Stay safe... take care...and gratitude for the health workers on the front line...<br /><br />And afterwards...there&#039;ll be challenging times ahead...but we&#039;re New Yorkers and we&#039;ll overcome them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Matt:<br /><br />I am glad you framed your question specifically for Jackson Heights. Since New York real estate market is a constellation of mico-sectors, Jackson Heights is on of them. <br /><br />It would be pure speculation to speak on HOW it may be affected, but I it will be factual to state WHAT will affect it. While COVID fog keeps us all home, real estate industry and apartment sales are at a standstill. All activity, with exception of remote servicing aspect of deals already in progress are at full stop. <br /><br />Now on Jackson Heights: <br />Question is WHAT will affect Jackson Heights market after the COVID fog clears and we can resume life as usual. <br /><br />Since nearly 90% of all Jackson Heights owned residential inventory is comprised of primary coop residences, we will need to see a mass selloff of personal homes. In order for prices to begin to drop we will need to see an unusually high spike in available inventory for a period of Four plus (4+) months and a trend of increase in inventory while these properties sit on the market. <br /><br />Important to remember, that qualification for most of Jackson Heights coops has been carefully buffered for owners to be able to withstand temporary job loss and debt to income ratios are kept low enough not to exceed comfortable housing payment levels. Some level of acceptable reserves are also accounted for and loan to value requirements assure positive equity in any market fluctuation (yes coop owners have more skin in the game). Effectively, Jackson Heights property ownership has been built to withstand shock to the economy. <br /><br />There may be potential sellers right now, who were about to go to market and did not, potential sellers who are now in the process of deciding to sell, because they need more space or had life changing event. They will inevitably be the first wave of properties to come to market. Beyond that, we can only be predicting a panic sell-off.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">I, personally, do NOT predict a panic sell-off in Jackson Heights!</span> Once COVID passes, and have no doubt it will, we will see improvement in the economy and any panic selling thoughts anyone may have right now, will be a thing of a past.&nbsp; <br /><br />As COVID goes on, I am working on two closings, which are still on track and send out a contract, which was negotiated before we received a mandate to stay home. Work will still get done. <br /><br />I wish everyone strength, perseverance and I look forward to seeing you on the other side of this! I also hope the next post I write, will validate my personal opinion, which I base on my personal knowledge of folks who have made Jackson Heights home, how much they love and value it. <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen

				abcdefghijk. I follow your reasoning. <br /><br />I want to clarify. What I meant was that each sector of NY market behaves differently and reacts differently to market change. For most part NYC market has not been doing well, 2017, 2018, 2019 have been down years and it had been considered &quot;buyers market&quot; (2020 too early to call), yet pricing curve in Jackson Heights AND a list of other markets such as many areas of Brooklyn and certain pricing sector in Manhattan had been slowly, yet steadily up. <br /><br />If inventory increases and stays, in ANY one sector of NYC, that sector will see price drops. If available inventory in a market area gets scooped up, they will see an increase. Guess the point I am not in agreement with, is that NY is one big market that all sectors move up and down together. <br /><br />Hope this is helpful.

				AFAIK people either don&#039;t move during recessions, or they move to larger cities where there are more jobs. So NYC should be fine.<br /><br />Except in this case people might want to avoid NYC, if they get scared of living in dense, public transport oriented cities where viruses like this one can spread so easily...<br /><br />Nobody knows yet. Maybe NYC will actually have the best response of any city and people will want to move here. Cuomo seems to be doing a good job so far.

				Though it may feel good to pretend about Jackson Heights&#039; &quot;exceptionalism&quot;, I have never read of an instance in history where a recession or depression didn&#039;t decrease property values.<br /><br />Temporarily. <br /><br />Until the recession/depression was over.<br /><br />

				I agree that Jackson Heights is not in a bubble, however I also agree that the affect will be different from neighborhood to neighborhood. <br /><br />I&#039;m really worried about all of our small businesses. So far the government&#039;s response has been slow and it hasn&#039;t been big enough. I worry that many will not be able to reopen or if they can, they will be too far into debt to stay open for very long. <br /><br />If we have many empty storefronts along 37th, Roosevelt, Northern, 74th/73rd, 82nd street, etc. - it will definitely make JH a less desirable place to live. This problem won&#039;t be limited to JH, of course.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been wanting to move to a larger space in JH for some time now. I&#039;ve felt the prices had gone up too much, too fast which has prevented me from moving forward. Once the dust settles, it will be interesting to see how this changes the local housing market. It&#039;s definitely a possibility that I won&#039;t want to stay here (although an unlikely one!).

				The unfortunate things I am reading, is that they&#039;re saying only chain stores might survive this leap off the cliff due the pandemic.<br /><br />Because chain stores might have some cushion of money. (Might!)<br /><br />Small mom and pop businesses certainly don&#039;t much have cash. They usually run on an overdraft. <br /><br />Yes, Matt. Folks in your situation might definitely reconsider. However, there won&#039;t be a neighborhood in NYC that&#039;s unaffected. <br /><br />All of NYC will be in the same boat. Except perhaps places with mostly chain stores. <br /><br />Where&#039;s that? Er...Times Square? <br /><br />The streetscape of NYC...(including Jackson Heights) and elsewhere even outside NYC...will surely never be the same...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Prior to the stock market crash which began in September 2008, my 900 sf prewar one bedroom market value was $300.000.&nbsp; In January 2012, I decided that I wanted to sell and get something similar on a higher floor with more light.&nbsp; A realtor informed me that there were 116 one bedrooms for sale in Jackson Heights and estimated I would get possibly $225,000 and this was 39 months after the crash began.&nbsp; This was a decrease of 25%.&nbsp; &nbsp;The $300,000 price did not return until the 2nd half of 2014 or 6 years after the stock market crash began.&nbsp; <br /><br />The stock market is in correction but has not crashed but the possibility remains.&nbsp; Although we won&#039;t have any idea of how the real estate market will be effected in Jackson Heights until late this year, its not a question of IF prices will decline but by HOW much.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				I&#039;ve been sitting on my hands wondering if any of the other agents or brokers on this message board wanted to weigh in first. I don&#039;t think any of us know exactly what to expect once it&#039;s safe for us to resume full activities. Governor Cuomo&#039;s executive order declared real estate businesses to be non-essential, so we are barred from doing showings, holding open houses (unless virtual), or meeting face to face with clients or customers until the order is lifted. Transactions already in progress continue, so long as the lawyers and lenders are willing and able to do so, but for the rest of us, the &quot;pause&quot; button has been pressed.<br /><br />How badly the real estate market is affected will ultimately rest upon the economic damage caused to local economies by the closure of businesses and the loss of jobs. This crisis is caused by a pandemic to which the stock market is reacting, not by a fundamental breakdown of sound lending and investment practices which undermined the real estate and financial markets as was the case in 2007. If local economies bounce back relatively quick after COVAD-19 and our financial institutions are still solvent, then I would expect the real estate market to bounce back vigorously as well. One would hope that mortgage interests rates would stay close to historic lows, and that the government would step up if legislation is required to jumpstart the free flow of capital again. <br /><br />One other thing will be true: Life will resume. People will marry or divorce; Start a family or send the kids off to college; Plan for retirement or seek new employment. If you were planning to buy a property in the next year, now is the time to get your finances in order and figure out exactly how much home you can afford. If you were thinking of selling, perhaps now is the time to make a few needed repairs and clean out that attic and basement. In a down market, the ones who are best prepared to move forward will be the ones best able to take advantage of any opportunities that arise. <br /><br />Please stay safe and take care of each other.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Steven Tomkiewicz</strong><br /><em>Licensed Real Estate Salesperson</em><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Keller Williams Realty–Landmark II</strong><br />75-35 31st Avenue, Suite 202<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11370<br />&nbsp;<br />Cell/Text: 646-541-7253<br />Office: 347-846-1200<br />https://steventomkiewicz.kw.com/ (https://steventomkiewicz.kw.com/)<br />https://app.kw.com/KW2MW27QB (https://app.kw.com/KW2MW27QB)<br />stomkiewicz@kw.com</span>

				My recent quote to Curbed NYC:<br /><br />“If I had to sum it up, clients already in contract are still on the way to the closing table,” says Armen Meschian of brokerage CORE. “Those with active listings are at zero.”<br /><br />Many other brokers weighed in also, so this may be a good article to read. <br /><br />https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/10/21173411/coronavirus-new-york-real-estate-home-prices-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR3LQsIHCYQRJtAG3zhhAhATRmJhjtSwEdGoDKKmY4o74mRQp6vwsUsr6Sw (https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/10/21173411/coronavirus-new-york-real-estate-home-prices-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR3LQsIHCYQRJtAG3zhhAhATRmJhjtSwEdGoDKKmY4o74mRQp6vwsUsr6Sw)

				I think most homes in JH are still quite moderately priced, undervalued in NYC, so we would have that cushion. <br /><br /><br />I think there might be a number of people making life decisions when the dust settles too. Myself included - we only get to do this once!

				a good article, and interesting data. but signs are pointing to a much longer, much deeper economic downturn -- a lot of insiders are using the word &quot;depression,&quot; not recession. we already have unemployment levels that most of us have never seen, and i&#039;ve seen several articles from experts surmising that 40-50 percent of &quot;temporarily&quot; closed businesses will not reopen.<br /><br />hoping that&#039;s overly pessimistic, of course, but i&#039;m concerned.

				^I certainly hope people aren&#039;t that misinformed about how long a virus can live on surfaces or airborne. A virus needs living cells to survive long-term. We wipe down door knobs, our phones, remote controls, etc. because we touch those surfaces frequently and viruses have been shown to be able to survive for a couple of days on those surfaces. But the virus can&#039;t live forever without live cells to invade.<br /><br />So, unless you&#039;re doing an open house in the couple of days immediately after death -- which you aren&#039;t. Even with a will, you have to go to court to determine the executor of the estate as well as the inheritors -- there isn&#039;t a risk. You also probably won&#039;t be able to remove items from an apartment in a coop before all the court stuff regarding naming an executor is sorted out. The coop&#039;s know they have a legal responsibility to keep the property in question where it is until it&#039;s been settled in court (lest family with access to the apartment come over and take items that were supposed to be inherited by someone else).<br /><br />So unless family is deeply misinformed about the non-risk of contamination, doesn&#039;t seem like an issue to me.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://jamaicahospital.org/newsletter/how-long-can-viruses-live-outside-the-body/</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The life of a virus (technically, viruses are not alive) depends on what type of virus it is, the conditions of the environment it is in, as well as the type of surface it is on.<br /><br />Cold viruses have been shown to survive on indoor surfaces for approximately seven days. Flu viruses, however, are active for only 24 hours.<br /><br />All viruses have the potential to live on hard surfaces, such as metal and plastic, longer than on fabrics and other soft surfaces. In fact, infectious flu viruses can survive on tissues for only 15 minutes.

				Yes, I realize there would be no chance of such contamination in an estate sale. But the commenter asked if people would be willing to &quot;brave&quot; an estate sale during this time, so that&#039;s how I read that comment.
