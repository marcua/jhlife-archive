				does anyone have a recommendation for a reliable plumber for a couple of relatively small jobs? a good price would obviously be a plus, but reliability and qualty work are more important.<br /><br />thanks in advance!

				My furnace died unexpectedly (ain&#039;t it always the way!) in the middle of February.&nbsp; After several calls to the two plumbers I used most often went unreturned, in desperation, I went to the yellow pages and found Parkset Plumbing in Brooklyn. They came right over, returned my phone calls in a reasonable amount of time, did good work and were reasonably priced.&nbsp; I will definitely use them again.&nbsp; Here&#039;s their webpage with more info:<br /><br />http://www.parksetplumbing.com/2019952.html<br /><br />Good luck.

				I&#039;ll tell ya, I&#039;ve been through the whole phone book and back. After trial and error, I&#039;ve finally found a good licensed plumber, John Farr from John Farr Plumbing &amp; Heating. He&#039;s a good man, does good work and doesn&#039;t overcharge. He also comes when he says he will which is rare!<br />(917) 813-9573<br />ask for John

				I don&#039;t want to say who not to use, but i had someone who was recommended on this board check out a leaky toilet that was leaking from the second floor bathroom.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t to happy. He said the kitchen ceiling had to be broken to fix the leaky pipe. Uh Oh, does that mean breaking parts of the 100 year old tiled wall as well? Yup, but he said &quot;you could find the same 100 year old tiles on e bay or craigslist.&quot;<br />&nbsp; HA Ha. Ha<br />&nbsp;i asked how do you know&nbsp; where the leak is coming from? His answer was the pipes are 100 years old, and that&#039;s what it was. And he told me he has been doing plumbing for the past 30 years. Yup, he said &quot;that&#039;s where its coming from.&quot;&nbsp; No Doubt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hmmmmm. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And i asked &quot;how much would i get to pay you to do&nbsp; this?&quot;&nbsp; $1800. Nice.... And that&#039;s not including repairing the damaged walls and ceilings.&nbsp; I had serious doubts. I spoke to a friend who is a super.&nbsp; &quot;Wax Ring.&quot; I said what? &quot;Wax Ring.&quot;&nbsp; He came over, we lifted the toilet, and&nbsp; yes, the 100 year old wax ring was indeed decomposed. We went to that great little hardware store, on 88th and 37th, A $10 wax ring, and a little epoxy later, my ceiling has been dry for the past 2 months. So everyone, get multiple estimates BEFORE committing to the first one that comes buy. And dont take recommendations as fool proof. They help, but buyer beware. <br />&nbsp;

				Why not say who *not* to use--you could save someone a lot of grief. Like I say, I&#039;ve been through a lot of plumbers in the phone book and finally learned not to look in the phone book. I actually found this guy through a tiler.<br />Actually, I found my roofer online after going through the entire phone book too--I don&#039;t mess around with a 10-year guarantee!

				I don&#039;t want to name him because like i said, he was recommended by someone who did in fact have a good experience with him. In his defense, he was an older guy, who seemed to have a lot of experience as he said he did.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this case he was clearly very mistaken. My point was to always get a few estimates and i think most people will learn from different opinions I wonder what he would have done had i paid him, and the leak continued.&nbsp; Think he would have refunded my money? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t think so. And when i think about it, i did in fact mention the Wax Ring to him on his second visit, but i guess that would have made a $1800 job, a simple $100 job. So i guess my point is, if your toilet&nbsp; leaks, check the ring first!! :)
