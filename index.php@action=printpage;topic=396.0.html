				(This thread was split off from the Deshi Biryani discussion.&nbsp; It is now dedicated to the general topic of restaurant instpections and safe food handling practices.)<br /><br />Because of the very long preparation times required, many dishes from this cuisine are prepared in advance, rather than made-to-order.&nbsp; There has been a lot of debate about this on Chowhound.&nbsp; It certainly bothers some people, and not others.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the health regulations are, but I would instinctively prefer something be refrigerated or stored at room temperature and then served at 145 degrees, instead of having it sitting out at 145 degrees all day.&nbsp; <br />

				Hi Todd,<br /><br />I totally agree that there&#039;s no way these places could make their dishes to order, and in pretty much any restaurant as much food as possible is prepared way ahead of time and either stored (refrigerated), or held hot either using ban marie&#039;s, steam tables, or being kept in a low temp oven.&nbsp; There just isn&#039;t the time to make *everything* from scratch to order.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the NYC guide for food handling - http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/inspect/iguide.shtml, and if food is placed in a steam table it&#039;s got to be held at 140 or above (sorry, 145 is pasteurization - got my temps mixed up).&nbsp; It&#039;s equivalent to putting something in a 200 degree oven just to keep it warm until you serve it.&nbsp; You&#039;re not still cooking the food at 145, just keeping it warm so any airborne bacteria can&#039;t grow in it.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you haven&#039;t gotten sick from any of the food - and I certainly wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone. I also wasn&#039;t looking to tarnish anyone&#039;s favorite restaurants reputation.&nbsp; So I guess my question was more curiousity in how are these places passing inspection when the food in their steam tables are cold?&nbsp; Is it just turnover that keeps the food fresh?&nbsp; Do you have the chowhound thread - I&#039;d like to check out what others are saying.<br /><br />Thanks.

				The irony of this is that in all of my years voraciously eating street food, I&#039;ve never gotten sick.&nbsp; My one truly bad food poisoning experience was in a well-regarded, upscale restaurant (not in New York).&nbsp; <br /><br />Should we split the food handling discussion into a separate topic?

				well, todd, i guess the point is that the street food you (and I, and a lot of people) eat, such as halal, tacos, momos, kebabs, etc., is usually prepared to order and served hot off the grill in those carts.&nbsp; <br /><br />deshi biryani isn&#039;t &quot;street food&quot; and since one of their many volations was that their &quot;hot&quot; food was not kept above 140 degrees, it seems like NY_Epicurious was right, and I will continue to stay away from this potenital hazzard.<br /><br />No wonder the place has gone through so many incarnations - they keep getting cited!<br /><br />NYCMacUser - thank you for your enlightening posts.&nbsp; where can we go to get this information about other restaurants we frequent?&nbsp; links?&nbsp; thanks, again!

				It&#039;s a slippery slope looking at the violation reports on your favorite restaurants... very few restaurants out there have no violations and I am scared I would never eat out again if I looked at the site too much&nbsp; :buck2:

				I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve visited Deshi recently, but there are no longer any steam tables visible.&nbsp; I would guess that they got rid of these due to health department rules.<br /><br />There&#039;s really no reason to begin posting the health department reports on this site.&nbsp; They are readily available from the DHMH website (http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml), and anybody who has a strong stomach can browse there if that makes them happy.&nbsp; Personally, I am grateful that the city does an aggressive job (perhaps sometimes too aggressive) maintaining health standards, and prefer to rest assured that a restaurant will be shut down if it fails to meet the guidelines.&nbsp; If a restaurant is open, I&#039;d rather not know the details of whatever minor issues arise during an inspection.

But I have a neighbor who recently had an experience that has made me rethink my posture on the subject. She went out to dinner with a friend, and brought home the leftovers in a doggy bag. At 11:00 PM she and her 4 year old daughter and their 2 year old Yorkie had a picnic of leftover food from the restaurant earlier that evening. The dog was the first to show the symptoms, her daughter&#039;s symptoms started a few hours later. As adults, most bad food will never affect us. But this little girl who only weighs 34 pounds and this poor little dog who only weighs 6 pounds became deathly ill from the food. Thank G-d she had health insurance and she rushed her daughter to the ER. It cost her over $1,000 to get the dog back to good health from the food poisoning. I don&#039;t worry about the small stuff that the DOH gives out violations points forâ€”I couldn&#039;t care less if they have proper lighting or even verminâ€”I do, however very much care if their food isn&#039;t being handled properly or prepared properly. Now I look online before I go to a restaurant to see if they have ever received a violation for food handling. The young, the immunocompromised and the elderly are at risk. I am not young or immunocompromised!

				The Taqueria Coatzingo near 76th and Roosevelt...I saw the shutters with the &quot;Closed for Renovations&quot; sign, and knew it must be health code violations.&nbsp; I&#039;m still going to eat there.&nbsp; Every restaurant has its issues, and I have a strong stomach (and upon further review, those violations aren&#039; t much of anything).

				Yes, you can get closed down for a number of reasons that don&#039;t have the &quot;ewww!&quot; factor.&nbsp; Looks from the weblink that they didn&#039;t have the basic infratructure that the DOH is requiring these days.&nbsp; I would feel perfectly fine about eating there once they open.
