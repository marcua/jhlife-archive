Landlords normally don&#039;t simply halve the rent, they tweak in their favor for two $11-12,000 spaces. Starbucks can probably afford that, but are there any small businesses they have to bully out of serving coffee in the same strip?

				Starbucks definitely will have an influence on all the other smaller businesses. But I think the smaller places have there usual customers that won’t go to Starbucks. I don’t think it’s going to change the dynamics of Roosevelt Ave,&nbsp; maybe not this decade but eventually

				Having lived in Jackson Heights for 30 years, I find it very hard to see the replacement of a nearly five-decade-old, family-owned pet store that sold products that you cannot find anywhere else in the area, and where kids would go in to look at and buy fish, with another Starbucks as something to celebrate. Just another ugly reminder of the destructive power of spiraling real estate prices and rents. I never thought their coffee was that great anyway; there are a lot of places close by that sell cafe con leche or chai that are far better.

				&nbsp;We will also miss the pet store but truth be told, it was more expensive than some of the other offerings around now along with the convenience of a Chewy delivery. They were lovely people at Coral and great with kids, it&#039;s true, but in this case, I feel like it&#039;s an evolution of a business. The space at one time was probably so cheap that they expanded sideways but then it&#039;s hard to downsize as needed when the sales tightened more recently and the rent increases kept coming.<br />&nbsp; Starbucks offers a place in the neighborhood for kids and others that need a wifi spot to meet/work in as well as getting those beverages.

The other coffee offerings in the neighborhood are great too but I see the Kebab King&#039;s dollar chai and the Starbucks flat white as serving two different and co-existing clienteles.

				Ah, memories (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=9.msg2570#msg2570)!&nbsp; JH Life was created in part to satisfy the neighborhood&#039;s insatiable appetite for debating Starbucks, which was crowding out other discussion on JHfamilies back in &#039;07.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				So 13 years later and Starbucks, Gap, Old Navy, (Target) etc, etc have all moved into the neighborhood.<br /><br />But I would guess they have barely changed the feel of this neighborhood at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think the real change in this neighborhood occurred during the 50s and 60s when the so-called white flight happened. But people complain about this Neighborhood changing, gentrifying, maybe caucasians moving in. And a Starbucks.&nbsp; The total opposite than of what happened during white flight. You certainly had all these immigrants stores opening up. I wonder if people were complaining back then about the bodegas on their block taking away business from their own coffee shops and delis

(Detroit of today where they have lost over 50% of their population from their demographic peak) <br /><br />NY was shrinking in population due to the white flight in the same way in that 1950&#039;s/60&#039;s/70&#039;s/80&#039;s era. <br /><br />You can tell this was definitely occurring in Jackson Heights because Historic District co-ops had decreased greatly in price in the 1960&#039;s/1970&#039;s. (and then 1980&#039;s due to JH becoming a drug center for NYC) <br /><br />Co-ops were worth less because folks were fleeing NYC and population was decreasing.<br /><br />So, I imagine business folks were GRATEFUL for the immigrant influx.<br /><br />More folks = more business.<br />

Starbucks isn&#039;t a coffee shop - it&#039;s really a co-working/homework space. It&#039;s where people go to get out of their small apartments and work or study, and I&#039;m glad it plays that role (as opposed to, say, E77, which plays a different role as a social gathering space for the neighborhood.) I&#039;m concerned though that the under-the-tracks location will be harsh and rattly for people who want to settle in and get work done.
