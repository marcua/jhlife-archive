					Well, it&#039;s good to know the answer. I don&#039;t get why they told people they were putting in a new oven or renovating the kitchen. Why not be honest? You could even go one step further than just being honest and do a GoFundMe to try and keep going--but why not tell your loyal customers the truth in a situation like this? A huge number of restaurants are in the same straits and have closed or are going to close because of this. It&#039;s really too bad, it was a great thing for the neighborhood. I hope others won&#039;t be following them out of business, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been very hard to keep going, and I&#039;m afraid that come winter we might see more places closing. We&#039;ve been lucky so far--so many great restaurants here and almost all have kept going through this so far.

					Alphabet person is hilariously determined to spread gloom and doom as far as possible. Facts would include actual quick sales at high prices. An apartment in my building closed in June at the price it was listed at before the pandemic. This is not wishful thinking<br />--this is a fact. I have no doubt that sale prices overall will go down, but it&#039;s not as dire as you depict, not necessarily.

					Categorizing 1 and 2 bedroom apartments together makes no sense. One-bedrooms have always been harder to sell to my knowledge--I think there are more of them (high supply, less demand) and larger units are more desirable in general, even more so with work and school at home for the time being. So 2-bedrooms would sell faster than 1-bedrooms or studios. The unit I mentioned in this thread is a 3-bedroom, and those are still snapped up quickly. I will be interested in the ultimate price--the listing was just as high as it would have been before the pandemic.

					Oh well...I just took a look and it&#039;s evident that the grocery store is simply expanding into the Farine space, and if you think it&#039;s going to have a counter offering fancy pastries such as Farine&#039;s offered--well I highly doubt it. That would be an odd mashup indeed. I suppose the grocery is more profitable than the bakery/restaurant was, and that must be the reason for this. Though it&#039;s hard to understand how so many grocery stores within a few blocks can all be profitable enough to remain. Farine&#039;s was such a great addition to the neighborhood. Really disappointing.

					I know someone with a large, highly desirable apartment in JH who recently listed it for sale--and had a buyer lined up right away. This narrative that has &quot;everyone&quot; fleeing NYC seems quite exaggerated. The only people I know who are leaving are doing so to be closer to family--kids or parents--at a time when travel has become more difficult. Not because NYC is &quot;dead&quot;. The person who listed their place is not leaving NYC either--only moving to a larger space (a house) in another neighborhood.

					Interesting re: Glen Oaks! I never could figure out how an Italian pastry chef who opened a bakery with extensive bakery offerings was also making special halal meals for holidays for the South Asian community--it seemed like an amazing blend of cultures and cuisines and really admirable. Now it seems he is merging his business with a South Asian grocery--possibly both here and in Glen Oaks? Just really unusual.&nbsp; Was not really into the sweets, because we don&#039;t really eat them, but the food he served was really great. I hope something good opens in that space, whether by him or someone else. It&#039;s a great location. Another JH culinary mystery story--like Swim Two Birds!

					Work is being done inside JuJu&#039;s and the owner is there. I&#039;m thinking maybe he&#039;s turning it into a retail/takeout place instead of a sit-down cafe? That might be easier to keep going in covid times? Has anyone asked him?

					Yeah, this is concerning, for sure! We live nearby and will be more careful about locking windows. We also have stoppers on most of our windows--they can only open a few inches unless we release the stoppers from inside. For the ones that don&#039;t have stoppers, we will keep them locked and at least we will know that if someone wants to break in they would have to break the window--and we&#039;d hear that for sure.

					It was definitely not a two or three week run. I live right across the street and was thrilled at the idea of him serving dinner, so I was paying close attention. I think he literally served dinner ONE evening, and then told people he had to get more up to speed and work out the kinks before really starting dinner service. We had not gone there that one night but were planning to go the next night. But then he announced he would not do it after all, too demanding and difficult, I presumed. For that one night, he had a paper menu printed up (we took one home that day) and was serving the sorts of dishes he has always served at JuJu&#039;s--at least that&#039;s what I recall. It&#039;s really too bad. His food was great and I remember going there a lot around the time we moved here in 2011--getting coffee and lunch as we moved in, etc. It&#039;s really too bad. But he ran that place alone with the help of wife and son, and I imagine that&#039;s pretty hard to keep going. And how could he run dinner service too on that basis? I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath waiting for him to open a Lebanese restaurant in that space. Highly unlikely--more likely someone on FB was expressing a wish that he would do so. I&#039;d be thrilled and surprised if that rumor is true, though.

					I don&#039;t think being in a landmark building means FIOS is not an option. It goes building by building, but I am pretty sure some landmarked buildings now have FIOS. Ours doesn&#039;t yet, but that&#039;s just because we could not get Verizon to act on our desire to get it. Last I heard there was a recent meeting with representatives from buildings in our complex that are interested in getting FIOS--but I need to follow up and find out what was said at the meeting. It was with a Verizon rep, I believe.

					That&#039;s a non-answer to the question. I wonder why they can&#039;t be open about whatever the situation is. Seems like they can&#039;t or don&#039;t want to. How does emptying out the storefront relate to &quot;trying our best&quot;? Very mysterious.

					It&#039;s been interesting to see that most of our stores and restaurants are hanging in for now--not nearly as many empty storefronts as I see in Manhattan. I hope that can continue--and worry about what will happen to the restaurants in the winter. We are ordering from them a lot, and eating outside sometimes--I hope they can find a way to hang on when outdoor dining has to shut down for the winter. It would be so sad to see things start to fold at that point. Right now the streets are so lively with the outdoor tables and often music--a nice, hopeful contrast to the sadness I feel in Manhattan driving past places I&#039;ve been patronizing for years that now have &quot;For Rent&quot; signs in the windows.
