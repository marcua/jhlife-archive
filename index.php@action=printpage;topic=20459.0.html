				Nearly $600,000 for a one-bedroom in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; Have prices skyrocketed while I wasn&#039;t paying attention?

				It’s an attractive renovation in one of the most commuter-friendly coops, but among all of the units in the neighborhood, I’m surprised the NYT chose a 1-bedroom there. <br /><br />I’d have expected a more gracious layout in a very distinct coop like Towers, Chateau, Hawthorne Court, or Greystones, which all have listings (and with 2+ bedrooms which are more in-demand, given that many folks moving farther from Manhattan desire space).

				A similar 1 BR at Washington Plaza on the 4th floor (E44) closed on March 4 for $505,000.&nbsp; I would be concerned&nbsp; purchasing any apartment at WP facing 73rd St.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read many messages over the years about the high level of noise on this street.&nbsp; One of the messages was from a resident at WP that faced 73rd St.&nbsp; &nbsp;A former coop owner (not WP) on 73rd St moved because they could no longer tolerate the noise.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Think it&#039;s fair to say in Jackson Heights we have a pretty wide spread of one bedrooms, with pricing ranging from high 200&#039;s to mid/sometimes high 500&#039;s. It is true that mid to high 500&#039;s isn&#039;t the average price for a one bedroom, but the upper pricing. <br /><br />Does it give worry to know E building 1 bed traded at 505? Sure. In this case, it&#039;s important to understand that A B C D E F buildings each occupy a different lot in the cluster. The F building is the very corner, South and West Facing building on 35th Ave and 73rd Street. Which means above the 4th Floor, the top units enjoy an open skyline view, which in itself is unique to Jackson Heights ( as you know is built like a grid)<br /><br />Why the Times chose this property over our Towers, Chateau, Greystones and other listings, all of which are in our portfolio presently, I honestly don&#039;t know. But I know the editor saw something special in this apartment, as did the current owners, who also paid a premium higher than the 505 recent sale several years back. <br /><br />When we sold Berkeley one beds at 540 and 560 k back to back, one beds there traded in the 400&#039;s. When we sold one beds at Manchester at540-575 range, that also stood out. At that very time, Washington Plaza sales were setting new marks continuously. It&#039;s important to understand, that Washington Plaza development is basically the next best thing to new construction for those accustomed to living in newer buildings. Washington Plaza apartments fill that niche.<br />
