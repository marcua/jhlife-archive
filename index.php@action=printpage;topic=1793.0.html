				Every building in NYC was photographed for tax purposes between 1939 - 1941.&nbsp; You can order a copy of your building&#039;s photograph here:<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/taxphotos/home.shtml<br /><br />The photo of my building was amazing and invaluable, totally worth the fee.

				This view looks north towards Roosevelt Ave Elevated Flushing Line Trains, from the confluence of Baxter Ave on the right and 82nd St on the left. The title reads 25th St. Elmhurst. For those with imagination, picture the Jackson Theatre on the right along with many retail stores which replaced the white building. Please note what appears to be a white wall on the the same plot just before the elevated trains.&nbsp; It is said that ourdoor evening films were shown on that wall before the Jackson Theatre was constructed. On the left are some of the earliest private row houses built circa 1911. Some still stand covered by retail stores built in front of them.

				I came across a few interesting photos of the Jackson Heights of yesteryear.&nbsp; Among them is a photo of P.S. 69 dated May 28, 1949.&nbsp; The accompanying description states that Rita Hayworth attended the school in her early teens.<br /><br />Also included in the collection is a photo of the interior of a Bohacks supermarket located in Jackson Heights, and a photo of Eddie Arcaro, a famous jockey, during a hospital stay at Physicians Hospital.<br /><br />There are a few more, so check them out!<br /><br />Corbis - Jackson Heights search results (http://pro.corbis.com/search/searchFrame.aspx)

				I recently added the Google Earth app to my iPhone.&nbsp; Mys on loves zooming from space to zero in on Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I know from my adventures on Google that every few seasons the images are updated, but here&#039;s my wonder ... are the old &quot;sets&quot; archived.&nbsp; It would be cool if Lucas and his agemates could, in decades to come, look at old satellites images of &quot;Earth 2009&quot;<br /><br />Sample line from Lucas circa 2029 ... &quot;Hey, Ogier, remember when Travers Park only took up one block?&quot;
