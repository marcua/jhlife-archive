				Has anybody tried Green Fields Churrascaria (http://www.greenfieldchurrascaria.com) at 108th Street &amp; Northern Blvd?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been curious about it and wonder whether trying it is worth the cholesterol.<br /><br />A Churrascaria is a Brazilian barbecue restaurant.&nbsp; All the meat you can eat, with a price tag to match.&nbsp; Chowhound (http://www.chowhound.com/topics/387376) has a thread on various places around the city.&nbsp; Green Fields is a more affordable, downscale version of what you might find in the city.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a humorous perspective from a blogger (http://rogeroc.blogspot.com/2008/06/meat-coma.html).

				Yep. Ate there years ago.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t go back.&nbsp; You end up overeating and it&#039;s mostly meat.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a big fan of buffets/smorgasbords for that reason.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d rather just order one dish.&nbsp; And pick off everyone else&#039;s plate!&nbsp; ::)

				I&#039;ve been to Green Fields a few times as a guest for family gatherings/celebrations.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a huge fan because after all, how much meat can one eat?&nbsp; The hot buffet has an OK version of fejoida, rice and typical buffet fare (salads, etc.)&nbsp; The price per person is pretty high, so for someone that&#039;s not going to eat much meat, it&#039;s not really worthwhile unless you go for the experience.&nbsp; It is somewhat of a fun concept.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for me, my little table thingie was always on red (no more meat).&nbsp; I prefer going to one of the neighborhood steakhouses.

				I ate there about 10 years ago.&nbsp; It was someone&#039;s birthday or some such thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m a vegetarian... and it wasn&#039;t a lot of fun for me.&nbsp; I remember the meat eaters in the crowd being delighted.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t been to Greenfields, but have heard that it is just ok. It&#039;s owned by Koreans, not<br />Brazilians. The one I have been to in Manhattan Churrascaria Plataforma is really good. The<br />meat aside, you coud eat only from the salad bar which has all kinds of amazing salads<br />and even sushi. It&#039;s not your typical salad bar.

				The food was pretty bad. I went once and the cuts of meat were tough or very fatty, and the gauchos didn&#039;t come around very often. Got into an argument with the Korean manager about overcharging, and he was extremely rude to us. Never going back. I would rather get an enormous platter of meat at one of the Argentine steakhouses around here!

				Green Fields is the kind of place you go with a group of friends or your large family who love meat , lots of meat&nbsp; :rockon: :D :D :D<br /><br />It is all about the meat - beef, veal, dear, pork, horse (sometimes), chicken, turkey, and some fish. <br /><br />It is a rather large space, bright and loud - no intimate dining here :smitten:<br /><br />It is true to the Brazilian way of eating meat in large venues throughout Brazil - servers bring the meat in a skewer right out of the grill and cut pieces right in front of you.<br /><br />Being Brazilian myself some items surprised me&nbsp; by their originality =&nbsp; you can see that the owners who might be either Chinese or Korean have added some items to the buffet to make it more appealing to the their taste, which makes it even more interesting. :2funny:<br /><br />There are better Churrascarias (Brazilian BBQ style restaurants) in Manhattan and Newark (NJ) and they are all more expensive.<br /><br />Try it on a busy night, when they tend to have better meat available :-\<br /><br />Let us know what you think! If you are a meat lover, you will not be diasppointed :coolsmiley:<br /><br />PS: you must taste the caipirinhas, the Brasilian drink make with sugar &amp; lime muddled together and shaken with ice and cachaca, Brazilian&#039;s sugar cane rum DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!! :rockon: :rockon: :rockon: :rockon: :rockon: :rockon: :rockon:<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Plataforma is a bit more expensive but worth it, Green Fields use to be good i think they changed cooks or something there meat taste terrible its located i think in corona, not sure what that area is so its not even worth the price. drop the price and the quality of food they are distributing would be reasonable but for the price you pay and the food you get it just sucks. Plataforma, gives unlimited sides! Yuca, Platanos, Rice Etc... Green Fields doesn&#039;t even do that. bye.
