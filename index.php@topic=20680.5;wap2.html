			Sompong Thai on 83rd St.: lunch special is $8.95, includes a spring roll + soup, salad or soda. There&#039;s a choice of about a dozen entrees. Before the pandemic, they&#039;d give 10% off if you paid cash; don&#039;t know if that&#039;s still a policy.<br /><br />Maharaja on 37th Ave. bw 73rd &amp; 74th has an $8.99 &quot;thali,&quot; which is the meal served in a metal tray with multiple sections, filled with, say, a curry, vegetable, dal, rice, chutney, etc. I think it includes bread and a dessert too.
