				What is up with the all the honking in the neighborhood?&nbsp; We used to have &quot;No Honking&quot; street signs on our street which I thought were silly.&nbsp; They were removed a few years ago.&nbsp; Since then, it seems the honking has escalated.&nbsp; Drivers are laying on their horns and other drivers are joining in.&nbsp; (As if that is really going to solve the problem ahead.)&nbsp; I find it far more bothersome than the airplane noise we have to contend with every now and then.&nbsp; Am I going crazy.........or, is this really becoming a problem?

				Yes, it is a problem. I solved it by wearing Peltor No-Touch earplugs 24/7, whenever I&#039;m in the apartment, unless I&#039;m using earphones for listening to music or watching TV. The only other solution would be to move to a quieter location.

				They should make cars smart enough to detect when honking won&#039;t do any good. I think cars could be better at that than people are. If a car detects that honking is pointless, its horn will be automatically muted.

Yeah, that&#039;s the most frequent situation I see at 37th and 73rd and on 73rd between 37th and Roosevelt. Traffic gets backed up on 73rd and people on 37th blast their horns because nothing is moving. Often something way further down the block, like a double-parked vehicle, is causing the bottleneck. But a bunch of cars honking on 37th isn&#039;t going to make that vehicle move.<br /><br />The other thing I often see is cars honking because the car in front of them is allowing pedestrians to cross when they have the light. Well, sorry, drivers, but the car in front can&#039;t just plow through them!

				Several factors at work contribute to the problem.&nbsp; Inadequate parking near shopping leads to double parking.&nbsp; Trucks using non-truck routes lead to slow traffic flow as they attempt to negotiate the double parked cars. Pedestrians crossing despite the flashing &quot;Don&#039;t Walk&quot; signs prevent cars from turning. Lack of turn lanes mean that traffic backs up behind the cars waiting to turn.&nbsp; Poor visibility due to the double parked cars leaves drivers unaware that there are pedestrians present in the crosswalk. Taxis and Ubers stop in random locations to pick up and discharge passengers, rather than at the curb as required by law. Nitwits on their cell phones in the car don&#039;t see the light change.<br /><br />Solutions: Ticket blitz on cars double parked and not yielding to pedestrians. Jaywalking tickets to pedestrians who interfere with traffic.&nbsp; Pull licences for cars for hire that obstruct traffic or honk to flag down possible passengers.&nbsp; Build municipal parking lot.&nbsp; Don&#039;t allow new construction without adequate parking. More turn lanes and turn signals in congested areas. Ticket blitz for horn honking. Make it illegal for pedestrians to cross streets while looking at a cell phone.<br /><br />What would also help is for pedestrians and drivers to have consideration for each other and for the neighborhood. But since everyone is self-absorbed, this will be the hardest to implement.

				I hope everyone complaining about the honking files a complaint with 311. 311 also serves as data collection for the city, so every time someone complains about excessive, all day honking at a particular location, it&#039;s another point of data for the local precinct to see where there are problems to be attended to. Filing a complaint won&#039;t do anything immediately to alleviate the problem, but enough data points may lead to someone figuring out there&#039;s a real problem and the eventual resources being allocated to address the problem.

				being here 24 hours a day is more of a sample than driving by four times a day. i rarely hear anyone honk during parade times, because, as far as i can tell, no one honks during parades.<br /><br />the whole concept is based on lack of intelligence, not need. i walk down 76th or 77th and hear horns from people 15 or 16 cars from a light that just changed. some drivers are morons. idiots. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=14807.msg73957#msg73957">Quote from: Rhino on October 11, 2016, 09:52:48 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hmmm, I dvive by your block at least four times a day, often stopping at that light,and walk by at least once a day, and never noticed what your saying.

				You are correct, you don&#039;t honk horns&nbsp; during parades, you are only disturbed by the loud music.&nbsp; The honking is from the back up traffic due to the diversions of the street during closures. I&#039;ve lived here for 30 years right off a street light. I&#039;m not saying cars don&#039;t honk, what I&#039;m saying is street closures due to parades and street fairs only exsasparate the already crowded and noisy street conditions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you live on a street that is highly affected by the horns from street closures. On days that are parade free on 37th Ave, I don&#039;t think the corner of 76 and 35 is any worse than almost any other block. Unless it&#039;s the garbage trucks that are causing the back ups, when people tend to honk their horns, just like any other block. Maybe your in the corner apt on the first floor, which may make it a lot more to bear.&nbsp; And BTW, horn honking is one of my pet peeves, no matter what the reason. 99% of the time it is unnecessary, and does absolutely no good. It all comes down to lack of enforcement, as usual, in this neighborhood.

				I live on a corner property where , of course, there is a traffic light.&nbsp; A fraction of a second passes before people are leaning on their horns.&nbsp; What I find most grating is the stereo speakers blaring and vibrating my whole house.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be confused.&nbsp; We live in NY but not in the big city.&nbsp; If you ask most people what they like about JH, it&nbsp; is the fact that once you move away from the commercial/subway hub,&nbsp; it becomes&nbsp; relatively quiet and residential.&nbsp; It&#039;s a matter of respect.&nbsp; Like horns and loud music? Record and listen to it with ear plugs. That way you get the noise and the rest of us the quiet.

I am a native new yorker and have lived in 3 different boroughs, and the only place that compares to my block is the insanely noisy street I lived on in Taipei.

				The honking seems to be getting worse every year. I live on 35th near 73rd and it&#039;s absolutely insufferable sometimes...if a car doesn&#039;t move the nanosecond after a light turns green, everyone behind them starts laying on the horn like they&#039;ve passed out on it. Sometimes I want to get out of my apartment and start yelling at people, but that would only make more noise. <br /><br />Another problem is the people who make insanely fast turns when the pedestrian light is green and people are crossing. Soooo many times (especially on 37th Ave), I&#039;ve been crossing a street when it&#039;s my turn to walk and someone almost barrels into me because they&#039;re turning without looking. There are such bad drivers in this neighborhood.
