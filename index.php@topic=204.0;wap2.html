			Here&#039;s an interesting article regarding the recent firing of immigrant workers at Fresh Direct in Long Island City.&nbsp; It seems these firings may be considered as union busting attempts by Fresh Direct.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find the online article from today&#039;s Daily News, but its print version states that most of these workers are involved in the packaging department and are very distraught over losing their jobs.&nbsp; Fresh Direct claims to be assisting the INS as they check up on employee documents.&nbsp; Hmmm......<br /><br />http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/teamsters-and-freshdirect-spar-over-suspensions-of-immigrant-workers/

			December 24, 2007<br />Fresh Direct Workers Vote Down Union<br /><br />Employees at FreshDirectâ€™s Plant Operations warehouse voted overwhelmingly against unionization over the weekend. Given options of joining either the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers, the Teamsters, or no union at all, 80 percent of the employees voted â€œno union.â€ The vote comes in the midst of an ongoing labor crisis at the warehouse; over one hundred undocumented workers were forced out earlier this month as FreshDirect announced an imminent inspection by Immigration and Customs Enforcement [I.C.E.]. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the rest of the story from Gothamist.com:<br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2007/12/24/fresh_direct_wo.php
