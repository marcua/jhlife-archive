				He was a great old time basketball player. He played in P.S.69 in the schoolyard. He was almost as famous as Richie the Custodian.

				You might be referring to Bob Pol...[modcut last name]. &nbsp;He was a friend of mine and we shared many sports in p.s.69<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Sorry, had to edit last name out because of the site&#039;s privacy policy.&nbsp; See the rules for details.&nbsp; -Mod</em>

				A few years ago, a friend of mine who also grew up here, Eddie Stor...[modcut], used to run into Polatchek every so often.&nbsp; He told me &quot;Poly&quot; wasn&#039;t doing so well.&nbsp; He hasn&#039;t seen him in lately.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em>edited to remove a full name.&nbsp; See the rules for the privacy policy.&nbsp; thanks. --Mod</em>

				I remember him well. He was a P.S. 69 schoolyard fixture.&nbsp; He played a mean game of basketball and was the only grownup I knew who would take a game of one-on-one with a kid half his age seriously.&nbsp; The last time I saw &quot;Poly&quot; was around 1979.&nbsp; He was playing hoops with a kid and was badly out of breath.&nbsp; He was puffing, holding his chest, and he asked the kid to take it easy. Sic transit gloria mundi.
