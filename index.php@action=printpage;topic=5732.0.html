				I am looking for suggestions for flavorful and aromatic tea.&nbsp; Prefer no-caffeine but all suggestions welcome!&nbsp; I keep buying more and more brands of tea and keep finding them not flavorful enough.

				If you want flavor, try Yogi tea.&nbsp; Yogi tea is currently on sale at the Jackson Heights Health Food store for $3.69.&nbsp; They&#039;re similarly priced at MetFood.&nbsp; Really good stuff.<br /><br />Also the Traditional Medicinal line is on sale at JHHF store, too.&nbsp; Also, full of flavor.<br /><br />Have fun tasting!

				I like a wide variety of black teas -- darjeeling, assam, ceylon, breakfast teas (Irish, English, Russian, Earl and Lady Greys). They exist in a variety of scents as well if you like those. Green (jasmine) and white teas are also pretty flavorful. I normally don&#039;t drink decaf teas but I know that many come decaf as well. <br /><br />You may also like to try herbal teas -- I love mint, rosehip, and various blends. <br /><br />Trade Fair (the ethnic aisle) and the health foods store have a nice selection. Porto Rico in the village has a fantastic and very interesting selection of loose teas as well. <br /><br />Enjoy!

				Harney teas has opened shop in Soho on Broome st. between Broadway and Crosby. They have a wonderful selection of teas and they will brew one for you to taste. I am partial to oolongs, but they have many decaf choices. They have a small cafe in the back with delicious scones!

				Shelby, have you tried brewing them with two bags in one cup for more potency?

				Thanks for all the great suggestions.&nbsp; I will try brewing two in one cup and will check out the brands mentioned.&nbsp; Also I was thinking that perhaps the freshness of the tea inside the bags or the canister could make a big difference?&nbsp; I know with coffee beans it makes a tremendous difference.
