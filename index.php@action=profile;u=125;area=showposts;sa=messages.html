					Just to try and clear a few things up.<br /><br />As the Daily News article states and Len&#039;s post confirms, <br /><br />&quot;But the Garden School is in financial straits, said Marshall&#039;s spokesman Dan Andrews, and is looking to unload the land as soon as possible.&quot;<br /><br />Taggie, this is why the SCHOOL needs the bridge loan. If they don;t get money from a developer soon, they will go out of business. As you can see, the loans they took out are ridiculous and financially risky in an economy such as this. <br /><br />They need the money NOW if not sooner, and, in answer to other questions, the city has no process for getting them the money before the fiscal year begins in a few months. And there is the expected red tape of a city purchase as well. <br /><br />The beauty of a capitalist democracy is that the city has relatively little power (or zero) to make a private owner do anything as long as their actions don&#039;t violate local laws or zoning. The only thing we can do is the usual stuff -- put pressure on the Garden School, tell your elected officials that this is important, and if you have kids at the GS, vote with your feet -- tell them if they sell to a developer your kid will be going somewhere else. <br /><br />And by the way we can wait til hell freezes over for an annoucement from the school. That will come once they&#039;ve sold the land to a developer.

					I think it&#039;s important to remember a few things when you see that street and the park sitting empty-- <br /><br />1) It&#039;s been REALLY hot outside<br /><br />2) This is an all volunteer initiative, with city agencies granting permission but doing none of the work, donating a sum total of 7 large planters (but not the soil or the plants), doing none of the cleaning, plant watering, programming or anything else. In other words, this is a true neighborhood initiative. I&#039;d say if you don&#039;t think there is enough happening there, then it&#039;s up to you to change it. And you can. <br /><br />3) The street is closed 24/7 so that it can serve as an overflow when the street is most crowded -- afternoons when the weather is nice, weekends, etc. In a perfect world we would just close it then, but it&#039;s a logistical nightmare to close it -- clear out the cars, put up the barricades, etc. It&#039;s much easier to just keep it closed 24/7. <br /><br />4) Sure, there are times when the park is empty and the closed street seems superfluous, but the street is actually much more shaded, and thus cooler. Also it allows some space for younger kids to bike and play without getting hit by baseballs, soccer balls, etc. And when the park is crowded, which it often is, this will hopefully provide a lot of overflow space. <br /><br />5) So far I&#039;ve already seen a lot of activity on the street in the cooler evening hours including elderly residents just enjoying some air, families hanging out, games of catch, kids learning to ride bikes, skateboarding, etc. But the street has been closed for less than a week. Give it time to become part of peoples&#039; routines. <br /><br />As for the &quot;small patch of astroturf&quot; well, there was more than twice that amount but someone stole all but what you see now. So, blame them.<br /><br />Finally, I&#039;m not trying to be confrontational, but maybe it&#039;s inevitable. I have to admit, I really don&#039;t understand why there is any opposition to this project. This neighborhood has a TON of parking. It just also happens to have a TON of drivers. So, yes, parking is at a premium. And all those car owners know well and good that it&#039;s a tough neighborhood to park in and yet they chose to buy a car (and yes, I said &quot;chose&quot; -- if you need a car even though you have such great transit options then you&#039;ve made a choice to live in a dense neighborhood and own a car). And yet we are supposed to feel sorry for these drivers because 50 or so parking spaces got lost for 2 months?<br /><br />But really, would anyone argue there is TOO MUCH recreation space in Jackson Heights? I don&#039;t understand why parking is the holy grail. I really don&#039;t. Do car owners have some divine right to unlimited free parking spaces that I didn&#039;t know about?&nbsp;

					This is somewhat unrelated, but pertinent. <br /><br />I attended the 115th Precinct&#039;s monthly Community Forum or whatever it is that they call it, a couple weeks back. I could go into a detailed rehash but it&#039;s not worth the time. Suffice it to say, I am CERTAIN without a doubt that if you can get a few people (6 or 8 ought to do it -- 12 or more would be a slam dunk) to attend the next one and make a complaint and show of solidarity to fix this problem, they will have to take you seriously. The crowd was mostly residents who belong to the Precinct&#039;s Community Council and not there to make complaints, or else single individuals with some specific axe to grind, most of whom came off, frankly, as a little nuts. An organized, calm, but persistent group effort would be incredibly hard for them to ignore. Especially if you brought with you and provided them, for instance, documentation of 311 calls, photos, and other &quot;evidence&quot; of this problem. <br /><br />I think they meet monthly on Tuesdays, but take July and August off. There is usually a posting on the calendar section of this site.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

					I know this sounds insane because there is so much food in Jackson Heights, so much of it is amazing, and it&#039;s part of what makes the neighborhood so great.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />Has anyone else near 82nd/83rd and Roosevelt been unable to keep their windows open for the last month or so due to the OVERWHELMING stench of burnt meat that permeates the area all the time now? It did not used to be like this but I can&#039;t find any new restaurants in the area. Maybe it&#039;s a malfunctioning exhaust system. Or maybe I am being too sensitive and/or imagining things. Can anyone else in this part of the neighborhood weigh in? It seems like the smell is both at street level and higher up as well...I just can&#039;t find the source.<br /><br />

					I heard that some of Helen&#039;s constituents got postcards about the meeting (I live in Montserrat&#039;s district). Other than that I only realized it b/c I saw a flier (too late) in the window of the Jewish Center. <br /><br />It could have been about anything -- upzoning Northern Blvd or Roosevelt, downzoning other areas, or a million other things.

					This is great news, and a great step forward for JH. <br /><br />Though, cynically, I will note that in most cities other than NYC this is how it&#039;s always been (free public access to schoolyards). It&#039;s a little humorous to me that we&#039;re lauding this as a visionary move when in fact there are millions of schools in the rest of the country where this is already the case.

					I&#039;m torn. <br /><br />I really do LOVE that E77 exists and I applaud the owners for taking a risk and opening up such a great and needed place in JH.<br /><br />On the other hand, I work from home, and sometimes it&#039;s nice to get out of the house for a while. I admit E77 is small (and maybe these policies would change if they ever expand), but I try to be aware of the realities of the situation when I work at a coffee shop, and try to buy a beverage every hour or so, as well as lunch or a snack. If I&#039;m doing this, I don&#039;t really want to have to pay $5 for a half hour (I *think* that&#039;s the rate) for the right to use my laptop. <br /><br />I admit, this is a dicey issue. Like many other things in life, a few bad apples always seem to ruin it for everyone, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the majority of laptop users that are guilty of hogging the chairs. Yesterday I was there for an hour (no laptop) and there was very little turnover -- me, a guy reading a book in one of the leather chairs, 2 people from HSBC having a lunch meeting, a mom with a kid in a stroller, a guy writing in a notebook, and one woman working on a laptop. Based on this small sample, I&#039;m not sure I buy the fact that laptop users are the main or only reason it&#039;s hard to get a table there. The place is small, it&#039;s comfortable, and people (laptop users and others) like to hang out there. <br /><br />As the owners have said in a previous post, this is a work in progress. I think the wireless fees seem a little steep, but they will keep people from camping out at tables with a laptop. I&#039;m not sure what effect, if any, this will have on their bottom line, but I wish them the best.

					Rest-Au-Rant in Astoria (corner of 30th street and 35th Ave I think).<br /><br />Beers, wine, paninis, cheese plates, salads. Nothing special in the food category, but great prices, super nice servers, cozy atmo, etc etc. Everything Jackson Heights needs. <br /><br /><br />

					Mr. Softee can be more than a little annoying, I agree, and the honking really is out of control. There are places in the world with triple the traffic that we have and yet 1/10th the honking. <br /><br />However, the one that gets me is the group of 5 or 10 &quot;kids&quot; across the street. They must be late teens/early 20&#039;s and as soon as it&#039;s not freezing at night, they congregate on the steps in front of their building, talking, joking, yelling, etc. No music, not harassing people, just hanging out and being kids in a city where there are not a lot of places to do that. <br /><br />As much as I sympathize, though, they don&#039;t start gathering till 11pm or later, and are out there until LATE, and though they are not causing trouble per se, they sure make it hard to sleep. <br /><br />Am I being a jerk? Is there even anything that can be done? It&#039;s worse that I prefer open windows to A/C in warm weather....<br /><br /><br />

					Let me be the next in what is sure to be a long line of people saying PLEASE bring a place like this to JH. Although, personally, I would say that something that is more of a &quot;gastropub&quot; and less of a &quot;french bistro&quot; would be fine by me. What do I mean? Well, some place with dark wood furniture, low lighting, cozy booths as well as some larger tables, a bar in the front, and a casual, comfortable, welcoming feel that is not too fancy, but a couple notches above a bar. (I agree with a previous poster, in that I find NOVO to have absolutely zero ambience). <br /><br />Such a place would have a decent (even if modest) brunch menu, decent wine, decent tap beers, and a dinner menu that would include a great burger, a few interesting sandwiches, a good steak, duck, cog au vin, a fish special, and a smattering of other options. It might even serve food late, or even just stay open late as a low-key place to grab a beer, thus serving yet another purpose that I think the neighborhood has (a place to grab a quiet nightcap or two). <br /><br />Again, while I appreciate NOVO, I find it to be lacking in some undefinable &quot;vibe&quot; that makes it seem kind of dull for me -- I think it may actually be a little TOO &quot;nice&quot; and I&#039;m envisioning something slightly more casual, though still with great food. <br /><br />If our mysterious restaurateurs want some examples to check out, I&#039;d suggest Quaint in Sunnyside, Sidecar on 5th Ave in Park Slope, and Alchemy (also on 5th Ave in Park Slope). None of these places are perfect, but each does many things well, and taking cues from each of them would not be a bad thing. A step up in refinement than Le Flor in Woodside but with a similar comfortable casualness (and a bar) is another useful comparison. <br /><br />In my humble opinion, a successful new joint in JH does not need to be fancy, but it would be great if it had:<br /><br />Good food at a range of prices (from a $10-12 burger to a $25 rotating special)<br />Good beer and wine (microbrews and mid-to-higher priced bottled wine)<br />Weekend brunch<br /><br />I may be a snob, but I think something like this would be great. <br /><br />

					I&#039;m not sure what you &quot;disagree&quot; with. When I said JH was an &quot;unknown entity&quot; I meant it -- I&#039;d lived in NYC for 8 years before moving away and had never set foot in Jackson Heights, had never known anyone who&#039;d lived here, and did not know a single thing about it. It was, as I said, unknown to me.
