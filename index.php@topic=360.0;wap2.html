			I raised a fairly large family and learned how to cook for armies! Now that I live alone (except for 2 furballs), I find that I haven&#039;t stopped cooking in large quantities. Every time I want something that needs hours to make, I put it off until I can get some friends over to share. Would anyone please share some really fast recipes, that don&#039;t require hours of prep and cooking time, for me? <br /><br />BTW, I am an omnivore!

			This one is very fast and easy and pretty healthy too.<br /><br />ingredients:<br />shaved beef (Trader Joe&#039;s has this).&nbsp; &nbsp;or ground beef if you can&#039;t find shaved beef<br />broccoli slaw (TJs has this too in the produce area near the lettuce and some other groceries have this but not all.)<br />soy sauce<br />ground chili paste (or red pepper flakes)<br />cooked rice<br /><br />In a large non-stick pan, brown some of the shaved beef.&nbsp; When it&#039;s nearly cooked, throw in about a third or half the bag of broccoli slaw and stir-fry.&nbsp; Add some soy sauce and chili paste.&nbsp; If you have cooked the rice on a preceeding day and it&#039;s been in the fridge, put some of the rice in the pan with the other ingredients and mix and heat.&nbsp; If the rice is fresh, you can serve the meat/veg mixture over the rice in a bowl.<br /><br />Other possibilities would be to use some onion, garlic, sesame seeds or sesame oil.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can think of some other ingredients to add since you know how to cook.<br /><br />My other quick and easy favorite is a portabello mushroom and mozarella cheese wrap.&nbsp; <br />Ingredients: sliced portobello caps, sliced mozarella cheese, whole wheat tortilla.&nbsp; Brown mushrooms in a pan on stove.&nbsp; Preheat toaster oven (or real oven).&nbsp; Put cooked mushrooms on the tortilla and then 2 slices of moz cheese.&nbsp; Bake in oven til cheese is melted.<br /><br />

			Here&#039;s a quickie, but a goodie.<br /><br />Pasta with Garlic Sauteed Mushrooms and Chicken<br /><br /><br />Pasta (I use Barilla Plus Rotini) -- cook enough for one or two portions<br />1 small boneless chicken breast cut into strips<br />Baby bella mushrooms or white cap mushrooms (sliced)<br />1 small sweet roasted red pepper (from jar) -- cut into thin strips<br />Fresh garlic -- sliced, not chopped (I use 4 large cloves for 2 portions)<br />Olive Oil<br />Dab of butter<br />Low sodium chicken broth and/or Marsala wine (from liquor store, not the one from the supermarket) -- Use your judgment on how much liquid to add.&nbsp; The amount really depends on how much pasta you cook.<br />Salt<br />Red pepper flakes<br /><br />Season the chicken breast with salt<br />In a large sautee pan, melt the dab of butter in the olive oil<br />Add the garlic and sautee at low heat being careful not to let the garlic burn<br />Add the mushrooms and cook until tender then remove from pan and set aside<br />In the same pan you cooked the mushrooms, increase the heat to medium high and add the chicken strips to brown<br />Once the chicken is browned, return the cooked mushrooms, add the chicken broth and/or wine, cover and let the flavors infuse.<br />Once the alcohol from the wine is evaporated, add the mixture to the cooked pasta<br />Add the sweet red pepper strips and toss everything together<br />Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and freshly grated cheese<br />Enjoy!<br /><br />This preparation is quite simple, and I&#039;ve also mixed up the ingredients on occasion to include veggies such as asparagus and zucchini. :smitten:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

			THANK YOU Shelby2 and Chuckster. Keep &#039;em coming. I also have a slow cooker that I got as a gift a year ago, and have only used it once or twice. Any slow cooker recipes that don&#039;t require a whole lot of prep time?<br /><br />I cannot use pungent spices or hot pepper anymore. Unfortunately, my digestive system is as old as I am and it balks quite loudly if I subject it to the things I love! However, garlic goes with everything. NO?<br /><br />Besides Trader Joe&#039;s, I&#039;ve found some wonderful stuff at Costco and Fairway.<br /><br />Some of the prepared meals from Fresh Direct look so yummy, but I just can&#039;t reconcile spending that kind of money on, what essentially is, takeout!

			I have one more that is kind of unusual and is not exactly a meal - but it&#039;s great if you&#039;re on a diet or just need a healthy snack.&nbsp; It&#039;s a &#039;pancake&#039;<br /><br />1/2 cup cottage cheese<br />1/2 cup oatmeal<br />3-4 egg whites or 1 egg and 1 eggwhite<br />vanilla extract<br />2 packets splenda<br /><br />put all ingredients in a blender until smooth.<br /><br />Cook in a pan like a regular pancake. Super healthy and just as good as regular pancakes (in my opinion).&nbsp; This is from the Body for Life eating plan.&nbsp; (the actual recipe is a bit more exact than mine.)<br /><br />Sometimes I add cocoa powder if I want chocolate pancakes.
