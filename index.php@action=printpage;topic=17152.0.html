				New York City officials are excited about the City&#039;s bid to bring Amazon&#039;s second headquarters to town.&nbsp; According to the Times article below, Long Island City is one of the proposed neighborhoods to house HQ2.&nbsp; From the list of Amazon&#039;s criteria for consideration, Long Island City is in close proximity to airports and public transportation.&nbsp; <br /><br />What are the options for public transportation in LIC?&nbsp; How will this impact an already densely populated train system?&nbsp; How will the proposed 50,000 new job openings impact Queens west?&nbsp; If this proposal becomes reality, and LIC is chosen to be HQ2&#039;s new home, there&#039;s major change to look forward to...&nbsp; yay or nay?<br />&nbsp;<br />From the <strong>New York Times</strong>:<br /><br />In Amazon Bid, New York Brags About, Well, Everything (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/nyregion/in-amazon-bid-new-york-brags-about-well-everything.html)<br />

				Willets Point!! <br />Rail yards, ships, airport and it&#039;s the proper space. Plus, an incredibly hard working and local work force. <br />I&#039;ve not heard it mentioned publicly yet but it seems like a no brainer to me.

				Amazon is looking for a second HQ&#039;s not a distribution center.&nbsp; Being near airports and public transportation is not important.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think of a worst place for a second HQ&#039;s that will house employees earning $100,000 a year than NYC where employees will have to pay three income taxes (Federal, State &amp; City) and an extremely high housing costs.&nbsp; An $100,000 a year salary would mean living in Queens, Bronx or Staten Island.&nbsp; A better option would be a State with no income tax such as Florida or Texas and these state have housing costs significantly less than NYC.&nbsp; With a $100,000 a year income, I&#039;ll would much prefer living in Austin, Texas than Jackson Heights.&nbsp;

				The downtown area has a pronounced homeless problem, but overall I thought Austin was cool. Some of the surrounding areas seemed like nice places to live. <br /><br />My husband and I are both native NYers and at this point the only things keeping us here are our families and our jobs. Hell, my parents and my sister&#039;s family are moving out of NY soon anyway. <br /><br />To theplanesland&#039;s point, we&#039;d both consider moving to another &quot;less cool&quot; city if we came across good opportunities, and we don&#039;t even have (or want) children.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like NYC has a monopoly on culture and good food.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=17152.msg82028.html#msg82028">Quote from: N00b on October 19, 2017, 02:35:28 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why would you want to live in Austin over JH? <br /><br />If Amazon opens in LIC, I am sure a WeLive will follow for &quot;affordable&quot; housing of the type that tech people like.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I&#039;m a Software Engineer and personally I&#039;m not a fan of Amazon putting its 2nd HQ in LIC (and Amazon as a company itself, see https://sites.google.com/site/thefaceofamazon/ for reference). It&#039;ll create an adverse effect on housing market that&#039;s already over-populated and unaffordable and being in tech myself, the culture is neither good nor diverse. Boston might be better (close proximity to MIT/Harvard, although that&#039;s not a problem for 1st HQ I don&#039;t see it being a plus for 2nd). Big tech salary is rarely geo-adjusted (except internationally) so they get paid the same whether here or Nebraska. If Amazon thinks they have a better chance recruiting in NYC then they&#039;re wrong. Amazon already has an office on 34th &amp; 6th and they already have trouble recruiting.

				For a cool million one could buy a gorgeous home in Elmhurst and spend half as much renovating it. It&#039;s an idyllic neighborhood and commute for techies. Could rival Ditmars Park. Instead, historical homes are being torn down and families leave the city in droves.

				The article cites housing development in LIC, but how much of it is geared for family lifestyles?&nbsp; I have friends currently renting an apartment on Center Blvd. in LIC.&nbsp; They&#039;ve made the decision to purchase in a more family friendly neighborhood in Brooklyn.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are plenty of young and older professionals with similar mindsets.&nbsp; If Amazon does land in Queens, I&#039;d expect to see a lot of change to accommodate what&#039;s lacking.

				Actually, I&#039;d like to see Amazon move to a Red State like GA (Atlanta) or IN or even OH.&nbsp; They would change the demographics and move the state towards blue. We need to turn some of these red states around and changing the demographics would be a start.&nbsp; It&#039;s young techies and managers would probably be mostly educated liberals and progressives and would not be a bad thing.&nbsp; Just my thought.

				The <strong>New York Times</strong>:<br /><br />Amazon Plans to Split HQ2 in Two Locations (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/technology/amazon-second-headquarters-split.html)<br /><br /><em>SEATTLE — After conducting a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon has switched gears and is now finalizing plans to have a total of 50,000 employees in two locations, according to people familiar with the decision-making process.<br /><br />The company is nearing a deal to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Amazon is also close to a deal to move to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, one of the people said. Amazon already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area.<br /><br />Amazon executives met two weeks ago with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the governor’s Manhattan office, said one of the people briefed on the process, adding that the state had offered potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies. Long Island City is a short subway ride across the East River from Midtown Manhattan.<br /><br />“I am doing everything I can,” Governor Cuomo told reporters when asked Monday about the state’s efforts to lure the company. “We have a great incentive package,” he said.<br /><br />“I’ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that’s what it takes,” Governor Cuomo said. “Because it would be a great economic boost.”</em>

				Dss, yes, what is the proposed location? <br /><br />If it&#039;s in the low income section, it would bring about an economic metamorphosis considering the boon in new clerical and service jobs, and the execs bringing all that real money/expendable income into the area. <br /><br />Notwithstanding, it&#039;s a shame the Gov&#039;ner has to offer so much in tax incentives as a lure, but it is what it is.

				i haven&#039;t seen a specific location proposed yet. abc&#039;s idea of a near-water placement (with increased ferry service) is a good one. i&#039;d imagine any build out there would have to be behind housing -- since views are so valued in residential, not so much in corporate.

				I just think this whole thing was a farce from start to finish. Amazon scammed everyone. <br /><br />I am bewildered by the Crystal City choice - my sister used to live there and it&#039;s such a weird area - very sterile with a ton of underground tunnels housing offices and retail. The tunnels were full of patent attorney offices because The United States Patent and Trademark Office used to be in Crystal City. It has since moved to Alexandria so I guess they have a lot of vacant space available. I remember finding it odd and creepy - I called it Mole Town because so much is underground. <br /><br />However, there is lots of decent housing, it&#039;s close enough to DC and is an excellent location for public transportation.&nbsp; <br />And I haven&#039;t been there for 15 years so I&#039;m sure it&#039;s changed a lot.

				The more I hear about this, the more I believe it will have zero to negligible effect on Jackson Heights.<br /><br />1. The new folks hired by Amazon like luxury modern residences (not charming and pre-war i.e. old). And Long Island City with all those sparkling towers seems exactly primed for that.<br /><br />2. The techies will be young and single young people like to stick together.&nbsp; And Jackson Heights is, in truth, a neighborhood for 30 years old plus. (And kids)<br /><br />3. The techies won&#039;t really be into buying co-ops. Co-ops are such an arcane New York thing. Hardly any place in the entire world does co-ops except New York. Condos are what these tech-heads will be into if they buy.&nbsp; They move around.&nbsp; They need to be able to rent any apartment easily. <br /><br />But LIC, on the other hand.&nbsp; LIC will see even more startling changes within 5 years.<br /><br />My two bits.<br /><br />

				completely agree about the housing thing: if this comes to pass, Amazon will be hiring the people that mr/ms abc suggests, and they are pretty monolithic in wanting all that.<br /><br />i think the main impact on jackson heights will be the transportation issue -- the plan is for Amazon to move in pretty quickly, and the city moves at a snail&#039;s pace when it comes to reaction, infrastructure-wise.

				Most of these Amazon techies will probably live in LIC in the towers in the sky and walk to work.<br /><br />The whole of LIC itself will become the Amazon campus.&nbsp; There will be little need to travel to Manhattan.&nbsp; Or even out of the LIC &quot;campus&quot; for these folks. (Maybe the occasional foray into nearby happening Williamsburg?)<br /><br />Truly, it now appears that LIC was developed with exactly this in mind. Couldn&#039;t be more perfect for them.

				Everything I&#039;ve read suggests that this is just a rumor at this point. Am I missing something? <br /><br />If it is true, I don&#039;t really think it&#039;s that big of a deal. Some people they will hire already live here, some people will come from other places. It&#039;s New York, we can handle it. 25,000 people is less than 0.3% of an increase to NYC&#039;s population of 8.623 million people.<br /><br />The MTA sucks in general lately. Adding more people won&#039;t help, but I don&#039;t think it will hurt either. I did have a GREAT platform controller stop the F train this morning to confirm it was running on the normal route as some were being redirected over the G line into Brooklyn. I&#039;ll definitely chat with her if I see her again. There definitely is hope that things will improve.

				There&#039;s a condo buying frenzy going on in LIC now -- van loads of Chinese buyers (and plenty of non-Chinese buyers as well).<br /><br />https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/amazon-s-move-to-long-island-city-sparks-condo-frenzy-114128<br /><br /><strong>Amazon’s Move to Long Island City Sparks Condo Frenzy</strong><br />Brokers flooded with clients seeking real estate in Queens neighborhood, reminding some of pre-crash property boom<br /><br /><br />BY Josh Barbanel&nbsp; |&nbsp; ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED ON November 13, 2018&nbsp; |&nbsp; The Wall Street Journal <br /><br />Even before Amazon.com Inc. decided to put a headquarters in Long Island City, the retail giant’s interest in the Queens neighborhood unleashed a condo gold rush. Amazon’s interest was made known scarcely a week ago, yet brokers say they are already selling units—sometimes sight-unseen—via text message. Others are renting vans and packing them full of clients eager to view multiple buildings, or holding group tours in Chinese.<br /><br />Now, with Amazon’s commitment to the New York City neighborhood, brokers are predicting the apartment market there will surge further. &quot;This is like a gift from the gods for the Long Island City condo market,&quot; said Patrick W. Smith, a Stribling agent in the area.<br /><br />Up until last week, the Long Island City market had suffered from slowing sales and rising inventory. Now, some brokers say the sudden mood shift reminds them of the heady days of New York City’s condo boom just before the housing market crashed during the 2008 financial crisis. &quot;This is the first time in my 20-year career that I have seen the market go from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market overnight, based on a rumor,&quot; Mr. Smith said.<br /><br />During the first six days since Amazon’s interest in Long Island City became public, searches on the listing site StreetEasy.com for residential property in the neighborhood surged 295% from the same period a week earlier, StreetEasy said. The biggest spike occurred in the first few days after the news, when search volume jumped more than 400%, StreetEasy said.<br /><br />Real estate broker Teresa Ali faced a frenzy at the sales office for the Galerie, a new brick and glass building going up on Jackson Avenue. Though the building, which wraps around a central garden, won’t open until spring, Ms. Ali said her team met with nearly 100 buyers on Saturday and Sunday. More than 60 other buyers were turned away after leaving their names.<br /><br />The same building logged 34 visits from potential buyers for the entire previous week, she added. &quot;Multiple offers were on the table&quot; after Sunday’s open house, while four more offers came in overnight. &quot;It was bedlam,&quot; Ms. Ali, a sales manager at Halstead Property Development Marketing, said. Her team ran simultaneous group tours in English and Mandarin over the weekend.<br /><br />‘Buyers are hoping it will become the next Silicon Valley and want to be in on that,’ one broker said of the sudden surge in interest in Long Island City. <br /><br />Speculative investors and buyers who plan to live in the neighborhood are betting on the promise that an Amazon headquarters would bring new amenities and stature to a once dilapidated industrial neighborhood, pushing up prices in the future.<br /><br />The past week was the building’s best ever, with deals on six of its 84 units and several more under negotiations, she said. There were 20 appointments last weekend, compared with four the week before.Eve n before the Amazon decision, Ms. Lee said, prices were scheduled to go up.<br /><br />&quot;Clients I hadn’t spoken to in seven or eight years started texting me,&quot; said Eric Benhaim, the president and founder of Modern Spaces. &quot;I sold 20 apartments via text.&quot; He said his firm’s agents, who represent many new condo developers, were now meeting with these clients to work through the paperwork.<br /><br />Brokers say there are about 350 new condominiums on the market in Long Island City and about 50 resale apartments. Some of these resale units had lingered on the market for weeks without attracting any interest but are now in demand, too, said Mr. Smith.<br /><br />On Friday, he found that weekend appointments at many condo sales offices were filled. So on Saturday, he took five clients on a tour—on foot and by Uber—of open houses. And on Sunday, Mr. Smith rented two dark blue minivans with drivers, and he and an associate each rode shotgun while showing properties to groups of five buyers.<br />Other clients met them along the way, he said, so by the end of the day they had chaperoned at least 15 clients.<br />&quot;The showroom was jam-packed and only grew,&quot; Mr. Smith said, adding that other clients crowded into the dedicated conference room originally reserved for his group.<br />

				lol smaller companies are not going to compete with Amazon where average comp is going to double and they offer equity that&#039;s actually worth money versus equity in a private company that isn&#039;t worth the paper that their venture valuations are printed on. There&#039;s already a robust tech industry in NYC and the talent pool was probably a factor in Amazon&#039;s selection. They&#039;ll easily be able to pick the top talent around town.

				I think this will affect JH more than some people realize. 25K is a lot of people and of course they will not all be all young, single techies. There will be quite a few people with families who will not want to live in LIC and will look for housing with more space (and lots of people want pre-war apartments, which is not that easy to find in LIC). It&#039;s a crappy commute from Brownstone Brooklyn so I do think JH will see a bit of an influx and increased prices.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				true, but the area of Woodside you describe may be close enough to this whole shebang that it skips the &quot;art colony&quot; stage and goes straight to luxury -- with shuttle buses, anything is possible.

				First post -<br /><br />DW and I were looking for a co-op in Queens and targeted Jackson Heights due to the affordability and proximity to our jobs in LIC and Mid-town, decent public schools, and great food options all along the 7.

				Here is just one of too many examples why there are so many misinformed people against HQ2.<br /><br />A tweet by DC journalist/WH correspondent @HunterW:<br />&quot;Peak New York: Amazon is being given land in Queens that was supposed to go for affordable housing. Now 1,500 homes are off the table.&quot;<br /><br />This is the problem--journalists making stuff up, and impressionable (read: drama driven) people &quot;learning&quot; on social media.<br />1) The land is not being given, but sold.<br />2) The 1500 homes were ideas for &quot;affordable&quot; apartments within market rate residential buildings of 6000 units.<br />3) The apartment buildings had not even begun to materialize, in ink or otherwise.<br />4) LIC is already residentially over-developed. <br />5) Amzn is planning a school, just as had one of the aforementioned sites.<br />6) HQ2 = opportunities for everyone.<br /><br />I used to live in LIC. I loved it. I can no longer afford to live there. I also can&#039;t live on Park Ave. or in the Dakota.

				there are pros and cons. <br /><br />i&#039;m not sure how much Amazon is putting into the pockets of the developer that previously owned the land, but, according to Curbed, taxpayers are giving Amazon plenty:<br /><br />&quot; Amazon will receive $897 million from the city’s Relocation and Employment Assistance Program (REAP) and $386 million from the Industrial &amp; Commercial Abatement Program (ICAP). It will receive an additional $505 million in a capital grant and $1.2 billion in “Excelsior” credits if its job creation goals are met.&quot;

				Yes, dss, I agree there are cons. I don&#039;t like the sound of the tax breaks, but I also don&#039;t know how much taxes it will pay in and to the State and City in other ways and over time. Certainly and at the very least, 25000 employees will pay City and State taxes that ostensibly did not before.<br /><br />Other cities also offered tax breaks. I don&#039;t know how Cuomo&#039;s deal compares to those. Every city but a Canadian city offered tax breaks. Pittsburgh I believe offered <span class="bbc_u">no</span> taxes. Arlington is the city that offered the cash grant. How to compete with that.<br /><br />The rich also get free checking, lower mortgage rates, and on and on. Money begets money.

				I recall that George Bush gave 900 Billion to the banking industry so it didn&#039;t collapse.<br /><br />The smart thing for the city to do (and what George Bush should&#039;ve done) is for the money to get some % of future shares of the company.<br /><br />After all, the govt/city is an investor in the expansion of the company.<br /><br />The city seems to believe in the company&#039;s future (Amazon&#039;s future).&nbsp; The city is betting that Amazon will thrive.<br /><br />And any other investor would negotiate a future return for investing big bucks.<br /><br />This is where the American capitalist system is weird.<br /><br />The government and city don&#039;t act like capitalists.&nbsp; They act like a socialist charity for big and wealthy companies.&nbsp; If the government/city acted more like a smart capitalist, then future returns from their prudent investing into companies like AMAZON, (and I&#039;m talking specifically owning shares in the company) could go into improving the public needs (housing, education, health etc)...<br /><br />The govt/city needs to negotiate like better capitalists.<br /><br />Which is ironic, since America is meant to be capitalist.<br /><br />There is a solution to everything!<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				And now this:<br /><br />Queens Housing Market Shifts In Wake Of Amazon HQ2 Announcement<br />Stribling &amp; Associates<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />QUEENS, N.Y., Jan. 10, 2019 -- Stribling &amp; Associates, a leading New York residential brokerage, today releases the fourth quarter Queens Market Report. The report is the only to cover inventory, reported contracts and sales across the entire borough. Like Manhattan and Brooklyn, Queens recorded a decline in the number of sales as the number of active listings increased. However, the borough managed to record both median and average price increases.<br /><br />&quot;Queens is one of the most diverse boroughs in the city, in terms of what drives prices,&quot; said Garrett Derderian, Director of Data &amp; Reporting at Stribling. &quot;Like Brooklyn, price increases for single and multi-family homes in the far-reaching markets drove overall price growth.&quot; Indeed, Southeastern Queens recorded a median price increase of 10%, and average increase of 11%. Southwestern Queens had equally impressive gains, with its median price up 9% and average up 12%.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We continue to see a spillover effect from Brooklyn, as purchasers get priced out of that borough,&quot; Derderian stated. &quot;We expect growth in those markets to continue at the steady pace it has been, notwithstanding some major shift in the market at-large.&quot;<br /><br />Northwestern Queens, for example, saw an immediate shift with the recent announcement that tech giant Amazon selected the neighborhood for half of its HQ2. Prior to the announcement, there were concerns over whether demand would keep pace with the thousands of new units coming to market. However, once Amazon made the official announcement, those concerns faded quickly.<br /><br />&quot;Long Island City shifted from a buyer&#039;s market to a seller&#039;s market in the blink of an eye,&quot; said Patrick W. Smith, Stribling&#039;s Long Island City specialist. &quot;The Amazon effect was immediate and has boosted interest in the area exponentially. Sellers no longer feel like they have to sell at a discount.&quot;<br /><br />To be sure, Northwestern Queens saw the greatest contract price increases: The median jumped 14%, the average surged 12%, and the average price-per-foot was up 9%. Derderian added, &quot;While we still have to wait to see what the final sales prices are, it is a promising sign for the area, especially as the rest of the city is in a &#039;reset mode&#039; regarding pricing.&quot;<br /><br />Properties in Queens spent an average of 118 days on the market in the fourth quarter, slightly higher than the 116 reported in Brooklyn. This was also the highest number of sales in a fourth quarter above $500K, and the highest percentage of sales above $1.5M.<br /><br />&quot;What we are seeing, especially in the Northwestern submarket, are some record or near-record setting transactions. This is a relatively new phenomenon for Queens but mirrors the heightened activity in the super-prime markets of Manhattan and Brooklyn, although at a lower price point,&quot; Derderian emphasized. Still, he advised these newly contracted sales are indeed a high price-point for Queens.<br /><br />Looking ahead, Derderian offered the following: &quot;We expect growth in all Queens submarkets to continue, although rising interest rates and affordability do present a challenge to that growth. Still, the borough offers many conveniences at a lower price point than Manhattan or Brooklyn, and along with the Amazon announcement, Queens is poised for a promising 2019.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Highlights from Stribling &amp; Associates Q4 Queens Market Report:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Median sales price was $598,781, up 4% year-over-year (record)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Average sales price was $675,183, up 5% year-over-year (record)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Average price per square foot was $573, down 9% year-over-year<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Average days on market was 118, up from 111 in Q3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There are 7.0 months of supply, up from 6.9 one year ago<br /><br />Recorded Sales:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There were 2,801 recorded sales to date, 5% less than one year ago<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condo units saw an average PPSF of $944<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Houses and townhouses made up 65% of closings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Co-op units had a median price of $340,000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Properties sold between $500K-750K made up 31% of all closings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 16% of closings were under $350K<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens was the most expensive market and had 7% of recorded sales<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Southeastern and Southwestern Queens saw the greatest overall price increases<br /><br />Contracts Signed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a 3% decrease in the number of reported contracts<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Houses and townhouses totaled 39% of contracts<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condos recorded the highest average PPSF at $1,056<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Houses and townhouses had the highest median price at $858,000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 16% of contracts were priced below $350K<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 20% of contracts were priced above $1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Central Queens had the most contracts, with 41%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens recorded the strongest price increases across all measures<br /><br />Inventory:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There were 2,700 active units in the borough, a 4% increase year-over-year<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condos made up 24% of inventory<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condo units had the highest average PPSF at $963<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Co-op units were the most affordable, with an average PPSF of $475<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 29% of inventory was priced above $1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 10% of inventory was priced below $350K<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 46% of inventory was priced between $500K-1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens was the only submarket with a median and average price topping $1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens was the only submarket with an average price-per-foot above $1,000<br /><br />About Stribling &amp; Associates<br /><br />Stribling &amp; Associates, Ltd. is a premier residential real estate firm with over 300 agents throughout five locations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island City.

				From <strong>The Washington Post</strong>:<br /><br />Facing opposition, Amazon reconsiders NY headquarters site, two officials say (https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/facing-opposition-amazon-reconsiders-ny-headquarters-site-two-officials-say/2019/02/08/451ffc52-2a19-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d6f5b7bdc00c)<br /><br /><em>No specific plans to abandon New York have been made. And it is possible that Amazon would try to use a threat to withdraw to put pressure on New York officials. But with a meeting of the state’s Public Authorities Control Board and a third City Council hearing expected later this month, Amazon executives may be reaching an inflection point, the people said.<br /><br />“I think now is the time for Amazon to make a decision because it has to start hiring,” said one person. “At some point, the project starts to fall behind.”</em>

				they have SAID that. <br /><br />those who pushed through the corporate tax breaks last year SAID we&#039;d all be getting huge benefits in our personal taxes. the reality is very different.<br /><br />i&#039;m completely on the fence about Amazon. there&#039;s no denying the benefit of added jobs. that&#039;s the biggest thing by far and a HUGE plus. but the {fairly large} number of native Seattleites i know insist that campus sprawl and influence have made day to day life worse in a pretty wide radius. <br /><br />and, as unlikely as it seems now, what if a future administration follows through on the current administration&#039;s regular threats to enact anti-trust legislation against Amazon, effectively breaking it up? <br /><br />

				&nbsp;Am thinking that the precedent of what has happened in Seattle and to a lesser extent, San Francisco, is the strongest<br />case against Amazon here. Once burned, twice shy as the saying goes. And the idea that Queensbridge residents would <br />be secure in their housing and offered jobs without a contractual obligation seems naive to expect Queens to believe. <br />The tax incentives can be amortized or put into whatever algorithms they want but the gut feel is that we will all collectively<br />be the worse for them being here. <br /><br />Westchester, Manhattan and Long Island residents might be disappointed but Western Queens, maybe not so much.

				Amazon should of moved to Florida or Texas because they have zero state and city taxes. In the long run that is worth much more than any tax breaks they got from NYC. There is much more land to build a whole corporate park with free parking for the employees. <br /><br />People don’t understand that Amazon was offered the same benefits available to any business willing to create jobs in Queens. The difference with the huge number is that nobody ever created 25k jobs in Queens from an out of state corporation. Amazon should probably reconsider moving here and avoid all our lunatic local politicians who never created even one job.

				JK Resident:&nbsp; I completely agree that Amazon should reconsider New York and move elsewhere.&nbsp; It never made sense selecting NYC with a high cost of living plus both a State &amp; City Income tax and an almost 9% sales tax.&nbsp; Beside Florida &amp; Texas which&nbsp; has only a Federal Income Tax, Pennsylvania is the only State with a flat tax which is 3.1% regardless of income plus lots of very affordable housing.&nbsp; Based on the number of shares that Mr. Bezos owns, his portion of the NY $3 Billion is $480 Million.&nbsp; If Maryland has been chosen it would have been $1.0 Billion.&nbsp; If New Jersey had been chosen it would be $1.1 Billion.&nbsp; Those of us long term Amazon stockholders who follow the company on Amazon Yahoo Message Board strongly believe that within 5 years the stock has the potential to be $5,000 a share.&nbsp; If this should happen Mr. Bezos shares will be worth $395 Billion Dollars so if you look at the big picture $480 Million means very little.&nbsp;

				You guys make up your own facts.<br /><br />AMZN chose NYC for its talent pool. The tax breaks were offered everywhere and just about anywhere, in many cases on better terms. It&#039;s not about the money.<br /><br />I would be the first in line if I could get my hands on a 1 to 9 return on investment. In dollar terms, it is 27.5 billion. I would think the socialists would be salivating.<br /><br />The 25,000 jobs plus innumerable peripheral service jobs are NYC residents&#039; jobs, not out-of-towners coming here to push us out. Queensbridgers are in an opportunity zone. <br /><br />NYC is far too diversified and strategic to be compared to outcomes in Seattle. And their coffee is lousy. Seattle is most likely better off because of Amazon, but the grass is always greener....

				I would say that anyone supporting this project is willfully putting their head in the sand and should go back and read this 2015 NY Times article about Amazon&#039;s toxic work place culture.<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html<br /><br />I have been to both 3 1/2 hour city council meetings about this. Here is what was revealed. After pitting american cities against each other in a sham contest, Amazon is now pitting unions against each other by making agreements with one and parading them around but, refusing to make agreements with any others. <br /><br />They also flat out said they would not sign a neutrality agreement if workers wanted to organize. Meaning that if, maybe, people wanted to form a union in the future, they would intervene.<br /><br />My friend is a small business owner in Seattle. He has his own record shop. I asked if Amazon employees shop at the store or does the company support small businesses. His response was that they don&#039;t support brick and morter shops because they are pushing streaming and online services. The people who do shop there are actually from other countries here on work visas, not people from Seattle, Washington state, or even the US.<br /><br />Additionally, the city of Seattle is now plagued by traffic because a big part of tech culture is taking your own car somewhere with ride share apps. His friend drives a city bus and he can&#039;t go anywhere at work as a result of the added congestion. The topic of traffic, cars, and fatal accidents is a regular subject on this forum.<br /><br />I&#039;m confident it would be pretty easy for one of the largest tech companies to create a bunch of fake online profiles to sign petitions and post here in support of them. That&#039;s pretty much what they are in the business of doing, more or less fooling people.<br /><br />Please read the above link. <br />

				Nobody buys at record shops or book stores anymore. Seattle is home to many technology companies and has no state income tax. Jobs create traffic and fills subway cars. If you close companies then you have less congestion. NYC subways were built for millions of people living and working in close proximity. You can try to stop progress but the global economy stops for nobody. The fulfillment center on the BQE probably will lead to the closure of many businesses in Jackson Heights. This will happen regardless if the headquarters is in Queens or not.

				The great Kenneth T. Jackson puts Amazon&#039;s HQ2 in historic context: New York Needs Amazon (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/amazon-hq2-new-york.html)<br /><br />And here&#039;s further evidence that there&#039;s nothing unusual about the Amazon deal: IBM, SUNY Poly creating artificial intelligence center in Albany (https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/IBM-SUNY-Poly-creating-artificial-intelligence-13597273.php).<br />This is welcome news.&nbsp; I have no complaints about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that&#039;s $300 million for &quot;hundreds&quot; of jobs.&nbsp; If &quot;hundreds&quot; means 500 jobs, then that would be $600,000 per job.&nbsp; If &quot;hundreds&quot; means 1000 jobs, then that would be $300,000 per job.<br /><br />Note that Amazon HQ2 would create 25,000 jobs within a decade and up to 40,000 jobs within 25 years.&nbsp; Assuming the lower end of this range, the $3B subsidy would amount to $120,000 per job created.<br /><br />Both of these projects are anchoring technology jobs here in New York State, which is absolutely critical for the long-term health of our economy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think we should have a vigorous debate about the details of the HQ2 campus, and ensure there are benefits to the community, but I&#039;m with Professor Jackson: New York cannot afford to lose HQ2.<br />

				We are a city of 8.5 million people. 25,000 is less than 1% of an increase - and these won&#039;t all be new people, some of us live here already. Seattle&#039;s population is under 1 million. It&#039;s not fair to compare the two.<br /><br />The article Todd shared is right on point. The city needs to continue to evolve and to diversify the types of businesses that operate here. We never recovered all of the finance jobs that were lost during the great recession, to work towards scaring Amazon and all of the associated jobs that would come with them is foolish. This city definitely has problems, but I think people should direct their anger and frustration elsewhere. More opportunity is a good thing. <br /><br />

				It does sound great on paper. but saying &quot;Note that Amazon HQ2 would create 25,000 jobs within a decade and up to 40,000 jobs within 25 years.&nbsp; Assuming the lower end of this range, the $3B subsidy would amount to $120,000 per job created&quot; isn&#039;t entirely accurate. It&#039;s COULD create. it could ultimately create 5,000 jobs. or fewer.<br /><br />the city and state were forced to make concrete guarantees as to what they&#039;re giving Amazon.

				&nbsp;Hearing that Newark is still interested in welcoming Amazon seems like the best move to me. They need it, they want it<br />and after hearing all of the complaining, they still have the welcome mat out. Also, it doesn&#039;t help to say anyone is hysterical<br />that doesn&#039;t want the Amazon deal. Am nowhere near hysterical but more like skeptical and it has just been hard to get a <br />clean read on both sides from pol (politicians) and the press.<br />&nbsp;<br />We&#039;ll get tech jobs in NYC and Queens too, for sure but hopefully in numbers that don&#039;t feel so overwhelming to our <br />community and that are spread out over the NYC area.

				Who would open a business in Newark?, known for its high crime rate and poverty? Chicago is also calling desperately. It’s too cold there. Austin or Tampa/Orlando are real options. Austin is already home to many technology companies. Housing is much cheaper than LIC. Even if you pay workers $120k after state city income taxes and astronomical housing costs, there will be little left for the workers to spend. If you want a car the garage will cost you $350 a month to park. High utilities costs add to the burden. The same $120k could get you a house in Fl or TX. The politicians are forgetting that the workers will be paying city and state income taxes. At 25k jobs, that means a lot of money at a time when many high income individuals are leaving NYC.

				The problem a young person would have purchasing a cooperative in Jackson Heights or anywhere is the up front costs.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking at a $450,000 one bedroom cooperative in Jackson Heights you&#039;ll need 20% down (for most cooperatives) which is $90,000 + closing costs + other costs if its not in prime move in condition.&nbsp; They will most likely be renting and there is very little rental inventory in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I was a rental agent many years ago in Manhattan and two singles sharing a one bedroom was very common so a luxury $3,000+ one bedroom would not be a problem.&nbsp;

				It only makes sense to believe that Amazon will have a effect on JH housing prices. JH is only two stops on the E or M away. I don’t need to speak to a tech worker who lives in India to ask him or her what they want. Amazon hires huge numbers of Indian computer programmers who come to the US on H1 visas. The US universities don’t have enough&nbsp; American students that study computer science. While not all workers will be Indian, many will be because the best schools for computer programming are in India. Who are the CEOs of Microsoft and Google? Indian Americans. What neighborhood sells Indian food and has Indian restaurants.

I know people who work for Google, for example, who are in their thirties with kids and mortgages, who live in quiet neighborhoods. That&#039;s a significant share of the people who work at companies like this. Sure, Amazon will recruit plenty of people right out of college who probably would (for the most part) have no interest in a place like JH, but if Amazon is hiring 25,000 people, they won&#039;t all be entry-level programmers with no job experience whose main interest is nightlife. <br /><br />I think with those numbers, I&#039;d be surprised if JH doesn&#039;t become an attractive option for at least some new Amazon employees. Whether it&#039;s enough to have a significant impact on the neighborhood, I&#039;m not sure. The potential impact on the neighborhood directly adjacent to the company&#039;s new campus seems much clearer.

				I would of done the same thing if I was Amazon. Who needs the bad press from idiot politicians who have never created a job? What is 0% of 0 it’s 0. Now NYC and NYS get nothing. I again repeat, if I was Amazon I would open in Austin or Tampa/Orlando. The cost of living and taxes are dramatically less. Talent will move where the jobs are. Better quality of life and a better financial decision over 20 or 30 years. The Democrats in NY look like anti business socialists.

				Honestly it is so sad and bizarre to read through the comments and see such a full throated support for a MASSIVELY WEALTHY corporation that is known for it&#039;s divisive tactics. If you knew ANYTHING about tech you would understand a large portion of these jobs were going to foreign workers with visas and disposable incomes. And that most workers in tech order EVERYTHING and take private cars anywhere they go.<br /><br />The rich will not leave New York City. There is ZERO chance of that. Where will they go? Wisconsin? Kansas? <br /><br />Please stop looking to the wealthy to save us all. Support small business. Go outside and shop in you neighborhood.

				Again, we are not $3 Billion richer now that Amazon is not coming. There is no extra $3 Billion.&nbsp; The money was to come from future tax credits from Amazon. <br /><br />It is the children of immigrants who rise from the &quot;underclass&quot; to become...even rich.<br /><br />That&#039;s the way it works with immigration. All is for the children/future. And those children would&#039;ve been very happy to work at Amazon.<br /><br />Plus you berating folks to shop local will not stop dreams of (and shopping at) Trader Joes.

				I have very little interest in Politics but for those that have a lot of interest and knowledge can Mr. Gianaris and Mr. Van Bramer be reelected considering that the majority supported Amazon?&nbsp; Also, Toddg mentioned in a past message that if Amazon walked the Democratic control of the New York State Senate could be short lived so can the Republicans get back control of the Senate based on this one incident?&nbsp; Just wondering.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It wasn&#039;t an ideal arrangement, in a sane world no corporation as profitable as Amazon should be receiving incentives to come to one or another town.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not a sane world and there were something like 20 states competing for HQ2.&nbsp; That said, it would have brought in around $90 million and $160 million a year to an increasingly cash starved city and state, respectively.&nbsp; <br /><br />

(Usual disclaimer: The Washington Post is owned by Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon founder and chief executive.) The ruthlessness. The instinct to dismiss critics and criticism. The arrogance and insularity of top executives. The fixation on secrecy and control. The disdain for government and the disregard for the public interest. The too-easy acceptance of extreme inequality. Many of these traits were on display in the HQ2 process.<br /><br />The political mugging that Amazon received in New York is a preview of what is in store for American business if it fails to repair the social contract and replenish the social capital it has depleted. The choice for the business community is either to embrace rules and practices that strike a better balance between shareholders, workers, customers and the public, or have rules and practices much less to its liking imposed by an angry and sometimes irrational public.&quot;<br />

				There were a handful of articles that have come out in the last few days that help clarify the situation. I think politicians were hoping the company would make concessions for the neighborhood but, Amazon wanted to use hardball retaliatory tactics instead. <br /><br />The mayor was on the radio last Friday and my ears perked up when I heard him mention the company had reached a framework with the unions. I thought to myself, it is likely why someone decided to pull the plug. <br />https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/amazon-labor-1.27345235<br /><br /><em>The union leaders, used to seeing union wages required for economic development projects, admitted the agreement wasn’t much. It allowed only for a fair vote by workers on whether to unionize, and provisions against retaliation against union supporters. “It was weak stuff,” Appelbaum said in an interview. “It wasn’t neutrality” in a union vote. “It was very, very basic and less than we would have wanted. <strong>But it was the first time anywhere we knew of that Amazon was willing to sit down and talk about a path to unionization.”</strong></em><br /><br />Then, James Patchett, CEO of the city’s Economic Development Corporation, who was GRILLED alongside Amazon reps at the two city council meetings had this to say to audience at Crain’s New York Business breakfast:<br /><br /><em> “They didn&#039;t perform particularly well at their public hearings,” “They never hired a single New Yorker to work for them to talk to New Yorkers. And they never really connected with people in the city.” </em><br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2019/02/22/amazon_blame_game_patchett.php<br /><br />And finally, a dirtbag landlord <strong>PAID</strong> protestors to fake support for Amazon.<br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2019/02/22/pro-amazon_protesters_reportedly_pa.php<br /><br /><em>At the protest, Musovic said that he&#039;d spent $1 million renovating his Long Island City buildings in anticipation of the company&#039;s arrival. He previously told Bloomberg that he&#039;d added new kitchens, flooring and other amenities to the apartments, <strong>with the expectation that he&#039;d be able to hike rents by at least 25 percent. Several developers also said they&#039;d bet big on the neighborhood, </strong>and many were devastated by Amazon&#039;s announcement last Thursday. </em><br /><br />Cuomo did not hold Amazon accountable to anyone in Queens. He was hoping for a LARGE photo op. City politicians were then having to clean up and press Amazon to make some agreements. <br /><br />The problem is, even if that happened, there is no way to account for the dirty tricks that people in real estate play and the inflated cost of living that would ensue before a shovel even goes into the ground.

				The Amazon issue isn&#039;t going away yet. As a matter of fact, things are getting ugly.&nbsp; City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer sent out a tweet stating that Josh Bowen, owner of John Brown Smokehouse in LIC, sent him a threatening text message. Apparently, Bowen wants Van Bramer to reach out to Amazon&#039;s Real Estate exec, John Schoettler, and extend an apology for protesting the Amazon deal. <br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/eNngIU7.jpg)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/tNvVSwi.jpg)

				Here&#039;s the rub: we needed AMZN more than it needs us. AMZN can set up HQ just about anywhere else. That&#039;s why they walked, cuz they really didn&#039;t have to put up with any BS. It illustrates the stranglehold big money and power has over us; fact is, if we want their money, we have to be seated at the same table.

Now, according to the New York Post, the company is shopping for real estate on the West Side of Manhattan. “The tech giant has been in talks with owners of two shiny new skyscrapers located just one block west of Penn Station — the newly built One Manhattan West and its soon-to-be sister project, Two Manhattan West,” the paper reports, citing “sources.” The company, which already has 5,000 employees in the city, is apparently looking for 100,000 square feet or “much more.”<br /><br />That footprint is significantly smaller than the 4 million to 8 million square feet of space Amazon planned to build out for its HQ2 project. But the fact that the company is still planning to grow its New York presence without a large, specially crafted subsidy package seems to prove the basic point many of the deal’s critics made, which is that major cities with large pools of business and engineering talent do not need to stoop to corporate welfare in order to attract major tech companies, which tend to go where they can find enough employees.<br /><br /><br />The sweeteners that New York offered Jeff Bezos to move to Queens—some of which, to be fair, would have been open to any company by law—may have encouraged him to plan a bigger immediate expansion in the New York area. But the “much more” in the Post report implies that Amazon may well add more space and workers in New York over time. Meanwhile, the real estate the the company was eyeing in Long Island City, which was already one of the fastest growing residential neighborhoods in the country, can still be used for another productive project like housing, and we don’t have to worry about the bad precedent of HQ2 encouraging other companies to sweat the state and city for tax breaks. Personally, I’m feeling pretty good about what I wrote last year:<br /><br />Even if the incentive package [Cuomo] gave Amazon convinced it to pick New York over, say, Dallas, something else probably would have grown in the company’s absence. The counterfactual to consider isn’t Amazon or nothing. It’s probably Amazon or a bunch of new housing, or some other tech company and a smaller Amazon office.<br /><br /><br />The Post is framing its scoop as a giant black eye for left-wing politicians who opposed the HQ2 deal. “Amazon’s renewed focus on Manhattan so soon after dropping its plans for Queens is an apparent rebuke to the politicians who helped scuttle Amazon’s plans to build a 4 million-square-foot campus in LIC, including US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, sources said,” the paper writes. It is unclear who those sources are, or if they speak for the company, but the line isn’t especially convincing since, again, having Amazon lease open office space in Manhattan while leaving more room for rental development in Queens is a pretty happy ending for all involved. But if tech giants want to own New York’s libs by moving to the city without billions in subsidies, more power to them. <br /><br />

				Probably, with time and in a low key way, this will grow to be the HQ2 for Amazon...there in Hudson Yards, Manhattan...<br /><br />Those new stores and businesses and apartments buildings around Hudson Yards will greatly benefit. <br />&nbsp;

				it could, but Amazon prioritizes lowballing everyone on everything, and i&#039;m not sure that could happen in Hudson Yards, where they&#039;re having no trouble renting out office and other space at top rates.
