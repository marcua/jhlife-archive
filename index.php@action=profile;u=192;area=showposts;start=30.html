					I just joined this gym a month ago, and I have to say, you get what you pay for.&nbsp; I was a member of the rock over in astoria for 5 years and it was extremely clean and well maintained.&nbsp; It was also pretty expensive.&nbsp; Now that I moved, BQE is the closest gym to me and it has parking which is a huge plus.&nbsp; The place isn&#039;t as clean as I&#039;m used to, and the equipment isn&#039;t maintained as well.&nbsp; There are a lot of machines though, and I&#039;ve never had to wait for a treadmill or elliptical machine even though there is a pretty good crowd in there.&nbsp; In my mind it is a good alternative because the cheaper price more than makes up for the conditions of the gym.&nbsp; It&#039;s not horrible, so don&#039;t think that, but it could use a little more cleaning and maintnance.&nbsp; For the price, it&#039;s a bargain though.

					I was actually looking almost 1 year ago this week, lol.&nbsp; The place I looked at in northridge was at 88th and northern, so it could be that your place on 90th could have a different board.&nbsp; I&#039;m not totally sure.&nbsp; As to your comment on how they get people to move into that place... I&#039;m not really sure with those sorts of requirements.&nbsp; I know there are a lot of places in northridge for sale right now, so that could be the problem.&nbsp; Of course, that might make it better for you to get a better deal.&nbsp; Regardless, i&#039;d check with the board about their policies before you sign anything just to make sure you don&#039;t get into something that&#039;s gonna cost you a ton of money in the end.&nbsp; There are some nice places there, but there might be some rules that go along with it that you don&#039;t know about.

					Hey, welcome to the neighborhood.&nbsp; I live over on 91st and 34th ave.&nbsp; I like it around there because there are plenty of restaurants to walk to and the subway is only an 8 minute walk.&nbsp; The bus also picks up right on 90th and Northern to go to the express train.&nbsp; <br />As far as that management company is concerned, I&#039;ve never dealt with them.&nbsp; One thing that you may want to look at carefully is the flip tax on your coop.&nbsp; I know when I was looking over there i was really surprised by how high the flip tax in northridge was.&nbsp; The president of the board told me that when you eventually sell you will pay the board 25% of whatever profit you make on the place.&nbsp; To me that seemed completely insane, so I quickly walked out.&nbsp; They also told me that I would need to install wall to wall carpeting, which is waaaay more than the 80% carpeting required by nyc law in normal coops.&nbsp; The lady even said that many people were being deterred from living there because of the full carpeting rule.&nbsp; <br />Anyways, I&#039;m not sure if these items will be an issue in your place, but just wanted to give you a heads up.

					I&#039;m not a plumber, so I have no idea why the piping would have anything to do with the dishwasher being allowed.&nbsp; I would think that water would be able to exit from a dishwasher drain just as easy as a sink drain.&nbsp; I could totally be wrong though.&nbsp; In my building, you&#039;re allowed to have a dishwasher, but you have to pay an additional $10/ month to offset the electricity it is using.&nbsp; I think this is b.s. too, because the dishwashers are waaaay more efficient than me standing there with hot water running while I do my dishes.&nbsp;
