					Having been to the UK Lidl and the Rego Park Aldi there are clear similarities. They both use their own brand for much of what they sold and competed on discounting that undercut their traditional rivals. They sold goods out of boxes rather than shelves and had very few staff. This would give rise to long Trader Joe type lines without any of the efficiencies Trader Joe has to keep the line moving&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />However, the edge goes to Lidl who I think had a much more interesting array of goods although that was probably because they were sourcing from Europe where they are based. Whether they can maintain that as a US operation is open to question however I was a fan of theirs and look forward to the opening of the Astoria Lidl in the coming weeks.

					<br />Lidl is a German-owned, Europe wide chain that I used when I was living in the UK. It has a very successful marketing strategy which amounts to &quot;pile em high sell em cheap&quot; as its UK rival Tesco used to say. Almost everything sold is its own brand and they had very good results with that. They often won blind tastings certainly on wine but also on cheese as well as other things. The store is no-frills, many of the goods are in boxes. They had suppliers from all over Europe so that they could have a Greek month or Spanish or Italian where they would offer goods from those countries on special offer. The last time I was in the UK I found their prices were unexpectedly lower than their American equivalents particularly for things like smoked salmon or specialty cheeses, booze almost an across the board better price. They have become a major player in the UK supermarket scene and really in Europe as well. If you go to a Lisbon Lidl or Prague or anywhere they have a reassuring sameness. <br /><br />If they are opening in Astoria I would certainly give them a try. I suppose it goes without saying that I was firmly in the Lidl camp.The only caveat is how much they might have changed to adapt to the American market. If they continue the products they had sold in Europe at the same price here they will be one of the few success stories of our depressed and suffering city.

					Today I passed Farine on 75th St which is closed and empty as one might expect however there are nearly ceiling-high loads of flour in bags inside the store. The branding on the bags suggests that it might be for an Indian restaurant -I am not sure if it is ordinary all-purpose flour or imported flour for Asian cooking(the wording on the bags suggests that).<br /><br />Is Farine a casualty of the virus? Is it being replaced by a restaurant? Does anyone know?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[Similar topics merged by moderator]</strong>

					You put perceived threat in quotes as though it came out of thin air. This threat alert came from Catalina Cruz and others <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CatalinaCruzNY/posts/783939152142178" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/CatalinaCruzNY/posts/783939152142178</a><br /><br />If the threat is creditable then it requires a response to protect lives and property which is the primary responsibility of the police to preserve civil order.

					There are many store fronts boarded up from 74th St to 82nd. There are a group of young men in front of Food Dynasty who have signs saying Looters Go Home. They told me that they have other groups throughout JH and were determined not to let anyone destroy our community. I would guess they are Asian young men. They all look like weightlifters or linebackers certainly able to do whatever is necessary to protect JH. This is what it comes to when a feckless and incompetent Mayor is tough on funerals and all&nbsp; talk when it comes to protecting lives and property.

					I&#039;m not sure this passes the smell test. I can&#039;t imagine what would be taken-the restaurants are closed as are the banks. the super markets seem an unlikely choice. I suppose breaking store front glass is an option but to what end? The looting has been in high end shops in tony areas nothing like ours. To give advance notice seems improbable. If there is anything in this then I hope there is a police presence as I believe the community would be rightfully incensed that Jackson Heights of all possibile places in NYC would be chosen for exemplary punishment by self-appointed activitists who for some incomprehensible reason think a diverse and peaceful place like ours hides jack booted fascists who need to feel the weight of the &quot;people&#039;s anger.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think anything will happen but if it does I hope whoever is behind it gets the message that if you sow the wind you reap the whirlwind.

					Today while I was on a return leg of long walk to Steinway Street along 34th Avenue I saw The Naked Cowboy who was standing on the corner of I think 72nd and 34th. He was in his regular jockey shorts with Naked Cowboy on his rear, white guitar, and&nbsp; multiple Trump 2020 signs on his front. He was chatting affably with a couple and I thought I heard him say he would be back next week. So was this some kind of performance art, a paid political event or simply the Cowboy defying the odds of finding Trump voters in this the bluest of blue strongholds of anti-Trump feeling. Does anyone know?

					<br />There are two stores on 37th between 78th and 79th that require gloves. They are general stores that carry miscellaneous household<br />things and are more or less next to each other although separated by a laundromat. I don&#039;t know how strict they are but there are clear signs about gloves on their front doors.

					Despite the big issues of the possible end of the world as we know it life does go on. And so I have a very small question. Yesterday&nbsp; I saw what seemed to be an entirely red bird. I couldn&#039;t see a crest so I don&#039;t think it was a Cardinal but it could have been. Has anyone else seen a bird like this? Could it have been a Scarlet Tananger or Vermillion Fly catcher both of which don&#039;t appear to be native to NYC?

					I am sorry that a loss of a friend was the trigger for your letter. <br /><br />I was a next door neighbor to you at 35-14 72nd Street during the late 40&#039;s and throughout&nbsp; the 50&#039;s. I am eight years younger than you so I expect you were not one of the kids I knew in the neighborhood. I did know the Mara&#039;s from your building-Sal Mara&nbsp; was the dad and he had two children Stephen and a little girl whose name I don&#039;t remember. I guess you would buy newspapers and comic books from the candy store(Menshall&#039;s? Smilers?) on the corner of 72nd and 35th.maybe a malted or an egg cream as well, the News and the Mirror on Sundays, maybe your mom went to Henry&#039;s butcher shop on 35th a little down from 72nd or perhaps you used the Chinese laundry(Lee&#039;s) and reminded Mr Lee not too much starch on the collar. Further down was the &quot;lots&quot; vacant and overrun with with weeds. The veterinary office still standing (and now a semi-official JH landmark I would hope).A&nbsp; tough Four Roses hard drinking bar next to it that is now a slick sports bar with BBQ. Stick ball and touch football in the street and then on to PS 69 for real stick ball. I assume you were at PS 69 when Dr. Jaffe was the principal and was it Miss Leddy who was assistant principal. I had Miss Garrarity and Miss Tuckman, Miss Ada Sperry, Mr Isby. All career teachers who I remember with great affection. <br /><br />Again I am sorry that you have lost a friend. At our age they are irreplaceable.

					We have used City Med on Roosevelt at least four times over the past few years. On each occasion we were&nbsp; seen promptly, with care and courtesy and more importantly with useful advice and treatment. I just don&#039;t recognize the descriptions of the service from our experience. We have invariably seen Dr.Venegas who has been excellent-thorough,patient, and well informed. If he had a primary practice outside of City Med I would certainly consider using him as my PCP. So while I don&#039;t&nbsp; want to disqualify the experiences of anyone else ours has been positive enough to consider City Med our first option in the event of a pressing medical need.<br /><br />&nbsp;

					I have been following the construction of Diversity Plaza from the consultation meeting at PS 69 some long while ago to the tree plantings over the last week. Although I can&#039;t imagine any circumstances that might make me a regular user of this space some of the original concerns expressed by other attendees at the PS 69 event still seem relevant. The main concern was that the space is safe for women and children and that means enforcement of a no drinking,no hassling policy and that means some kind of oversight.<br />In short it is a Bryant Park solution tailored to the needs of JH. It doesn&#039;t require constant policing just someone who keeps an idea on things and can summon help if necessary. if we don&#039;t have something like this it will just be a men&#039;s club for guys with too much time to kill.

					I think Chet had a brother who I didn&#039;t know. The period I am talking about is in the late 50&#039;s. I graduated from Bryant in 1960 -I think Alec would have been class of 59.

					In #279 there is a list of old PS 69ers most of whom I don&#039;t know or at least whose names strike no chords<br /><br />&quot;Name dropping:&nbsp; (PS69 regulars) the legendary, ageless Bob Polachek, Bert Lowenstein, Richie and Bobby Rubino, Charlie Berry, Steve Feldstein, Demarco, Egrie, Sid and Dave Daniels, Alec Myers, Neubauer, Allen, the Brigands (Buster CEO), Chester Lumish.....&quot;.<br /><br />Despite that there&nbsp; were a few who I did recall-the Rubino Brothers, Richie Neubauer,the Brigands, and of course Chester(or has he preferred, Chet Lumish) who I knew very well. However it was Alec Myers who I wondered about who I also knew well when we both attended Bryant H.S and we were involved in the Drama Group. Anyone know anything about him now?
