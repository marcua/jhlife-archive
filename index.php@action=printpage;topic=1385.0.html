				Hi,<br /><br />I looked at an apartment in this building recently and it seems clean and quiet. I was wondering if anyone had any inside info if the building and the immediate streets in general. Thank you in advance!

				An old friend of mine lives in that building.&nbsp; I think in general it is very nice.&nbsp; When I last saw him thought about a year or two ago he was complaining that the building needed some major repairs and they were talking about a huge assessment for each apartment.&nbsp; I would check that out before I buy.

				I lived there the summer of 2006 (subletting a room from the owner of an apartment).&nbsp; The apartment was beautiful and the building was really quiet (I was on the 7th floor).&nbsp; The only problem was that the elevator is very old and rickety and I&#039;d often just ended up taking the stairs because the elevator took so long to come.<br /><br />The neighborhood seemed nice and safe, although I wasn&#039;t walking around by myself too late at night.&nbsp; I had my car there and I recall parking being a giant hassle.
