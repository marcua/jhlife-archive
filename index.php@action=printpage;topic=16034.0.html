				&nbsp; SAVE THE DATE MARCH 5th for the ST PATS for ALL parade in neighboring Sunnyside!!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;March on your own or with a local group, the Jackson Heights Beautification Group*, in one of the most spirited St. Patricks<br />Day celebrations. The original politics behind this parade involved the exclusion of gays in the Manhattan parade but it has <br />now come be a home for many other issues. Phil Donahue is an Honoree this year along with the Anastasia Somoza the human<br />rights advocate you may have seen at the DNC convention. <strong>The speakers start at 1:00 at 43rd Street and Skillman Ave <br />in Sunnyside. Actual parade starts moving at&nbsp; 2:00pm.</strong> The parade route is relatively short and you are welcome to join<br />in or step out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;Come celebrate all that we have achieved positively in celebrating diversity and inclusion in contemporary Ireland and here <br />in the US! Solidarity is so important at this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;<em>**look for the Jackson Heights group signs at the starting point </em>

				For those who don&#039;t know the history of this inclusive and democratic (small d) parade. It was created some years ago in response to the Manhattan St. Patrick&#039;s Day Parade&#039;s continuing refusal to allow LGBT organizations to join in. Read more here, http://www.stpatsforall.org/<br /><br />This year&#039;s grand marshals are the outspoken and multi-Emmy-award-winning television host Phil Donahue and human-rights advocate Anastasia Somoza, who addressed the 2016 Democratic National Convention during prime time on its first night.<br /><br /><strong>Look for the JHBG parade and march with us.</strong> Gather at 43rd Street and Skillman Avenue <br />in Sunnyside at 1 p.m. to here speakers, including the grand marshals. Actual parade starts moving at&nbsp; 2. Hope to see you there.
