				by:Anthony J Trimboli- I can not believe how diverse restaurants can be in Jackson Heights, New York. You walk down the street there and see so many restaurants around. You may think all of them are like Spanish restaurants but you are wrong if you think that. Some are, but some have the most interesting of food. I find that to be interesting since Jackson Heights is like Hispanic mostly, I believe. It has like Dominican and Ecuadorians, etc. If you go to areas like Richmond Hill, New York, you will see an area which has only Indian restaurants. This is common because it is an Indian community, but Jackson Heights has more of a selection of restaurants and so does areas like Astoria and Sunnyside, I was thinking Astoria more. When I was there in Jackson Heights once, I was expecting only spanish food around the area, but it turns out it had restaurants from all around. Even areas like Corona have like only spanish food inside of them. Elmhurst is more diverse and so is Rego Park, but so is Forest Hills. I can not believe how diverse lots of the restaurants can be in Jackson Heights. It is unique. Some areas like Richmond Hill and Corona really have just the food for themselves. This area has a diversity of restaurants.

				Yes!&nbsp; I agree that we do have a nice array of dining options in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Although, I do have to admit that there have been times when I&#039;m craving some type of food that none of our restaurants offer.&nbsp; I&#039;m not hankering for a bistro or anything like that, but it would be nice to enjoy a good brunch every now and then without having to leave the neighborhood.

				by:Anthony J Trimboli- I found that to be so unique for the area. You travel around and see lots of unique restaurants around the area. It is more in Sunnyside, but you may know the reason why for that because it is on Queens Blvd right by the border, the same may apply to Elmhurst and as far as Forest Hills because they are sort of on the road by the bridge. But, Jackson Heights is all the way up there, sort of hidden in the North there, the only real major connections around the bridge there is like Broadway which runs around the area of the bridge, but is like in Astoria before terminating in Elmhurst, New York. It seems so striking how the restaurants are diverse in Jackson Heights when it is like a small community up there North. It is not on Queens Blvd by the bridge!!!! Areas, I said, like Corona and Richmond Hill are just into really food of the people who live there, which are communities, one is, sort of by the airport. Wow. I can not believe that, it is a community up north there with only Broadway sort of,it begins in Astoria, the only way making it close to the bridge, you also have Roosevelt Avenue also. Yes. Thank you for your reply here. Yes.
