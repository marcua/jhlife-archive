				I am in opposite boat as the Noisy Upstairs Neighbor thread. My 1.5yr old toddler getting constant complaint from our neighbor downstair. As she sometime get frustrated, then start to scream sharply and stump on the floor continuously. Even her walking seem to get complaint from downstair neighbor. And to the point it went to management, but we met all the house rule, and we also constantly getting harass that we too loud, them yelling up or coming up and yell through our door.<br /><br />Is getting stressful to deal with this and also stressful to constantly stop my toddler to do her normal activities. So we are looking to move to another coop, not sure if that is the right move or we will end up the same, is our first kid so this might be issue again if we plan to have a second.<br /><br />So anyone live in Hawthorne Court, Greystone and Washington Plaza can provide some feedback regarding how good the building sound proof is. My current complex, when I walk barefoot my wife can hear the stump noise in the other room and sometime we can hear our neighbor downstair talking.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m in Hawthorne Court, and we do hear the upstairs neighbors walking in shoes, and sometimes talking or the sound of the TV if it&#039;s very loud. But we are on the first floor, just above the super&#039;s apartment in the basement. When we moved in, the super&#039;s apartment was being renovated. I went down there and had my husband stomp around in our apartment to see if I could hear it, and in this case, I couldn&#039;t. There must be a thicker layer between the first floor and the basement, and also, I don&#039;t think the footprint of our apartment aligns exactly with the super&#039;s apartment. So we felt confident that we wouldn&#039;t have to worry about noise traveling downstairs. So maybe consider a ground floor apartment for this reason? The apartment across the hall from us is over the laundry room, so they really don&#039;t have to worry about sound traveling to the apartment below.

				^^I am sorry you are going through that. Children make noise, and if someone doesn&#039;t want to hear the normal sounds of children, they should go buy a house in the middle of nowhere with the nearest neighbors being a mile away. (And that being said, people out in the country figure out ways to be loud and annoy their neighbors. I knew people whose neighbors let their teenagers run their ATVs up and down the hills all hours of the night.).<br /><br />I hope you&#039;ll reconsider moving. Eventually your cranky neighbor will stop and your kid will get bigger and stop being so loud (but kids are loud sometimes), and if you have to go to the coop board and management company and explain that you are being harassed to get him or her to do so, I hope you&#039;ll do it (document all the nonsense - dates/times, description). There are things of course you can do to make sure your kid isn&#039;t exceptionally loud - put down carpet, use those spongy tile things in the play area, every body wear slippers in the house (that might be a big ask for a toddler, I realize), take your kid out to a playground every day to burn energy, do your best to not let them run all over until after 8 am. <br /><br />Given the level of escalation (and Covid), it might be hard to do, but you might consider asking your neighbor to take a walk/coffee with you to discuss as kindly as possibly how you can both live near each other peaceably.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Toddlers make noise and that should be expected, but if your wife can hear your stomping in the other room when you walk barefoot, maybe the toddler is not the only problem.

				There is not soundproofing in Washington Plaza. Some people have installed blown filler.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be cheaper to sound proof where you live now, rather than buy a new place?<br /><br />https://soundproofcentral.com/soundproof-a-floor/ (https://soundproofcentral.com/soundproof-a-floor/)

				Washington Plaza has great soundproofing for the apartments next door, but not vertically. My upstairs neighbor didn&#039;t have padding under his thin area rugs and it was maddening - my ceiling light fixture made jangling sounds every time he walked through his dining area and it sounded like an airplane hangar every time he vacuumed. I am pretty noise-tolerant but it became unbearable after a while. It&#039;s not as bad now that he was made to get carpet pads but I can still hear him slamming cabinets and stomping around. The people next door have parties that I barely hear but I can hear the dude upstairs sneeze. Weirdly, I rarely hear his tv or music. <br /><br />Honestly, it&#039;s my biggest annoyance living here (along with the poor ventilation - if your neighbor smokes you will smell it like it&#039;s in your own apartment). <br /><br />However, if you purchase a unit you can probably pay a little more to have extra padding added when they replace the flooring.<br />

				Thanks everyone for the replies.<br /><br />We actually like our hardwood floor, but now is mostly covered, guess not much to enjoy anymore. We have added those extra thick felt pads under all the rugs, but somehow my kid will always find the spot without the rug and then stump on the floor loudly when she get frustrated, I guess she wants that loud feedback.<br /><br />It seem like most coop have similar issue with the sound vertically. We didn&#039;t think of replacing the floor and add soundproofing underneath, but I guess that is option to explore, will have to ask the management and super see if they know anyone in my building did that.<br /><br />All the new place we looked at will add around $500 to $1000 more a month to what we paying now, and all depend on how much we sell our current place. But most have that second bathroom, which is nice to have.<br />

				Neighboring apartment noise is a function of dense urban living.<br /><br />The alternative is suburban living.<br /><br />Life= choices.

				&nbsp;Can you hang on till the pandemic is closer to being over? Many of us have frayed nerves right now and working from home and the need to stay in might be making everyone extra sensitive.<br />I can also recommend this noise cutting smallish carpet that I got from IKEA which really has<br />done magical things in our small room for a small price. Feeling for you though...

				I didn’t want my children to bother the neighbors so I had the entire unit carpeted with thick padding. Unfortunately, the 80% carpeting didn’t do anything to reduce noise in my apartment. Good luck!

I have a neighbor whose kid decides to run laps in the hallway everyday as they wait for the elevator.

But I can only imagine their downstairs&#039; neighbors, that is unless the mom lays down the law IN the apartment. <br /><br />I live on the top floor. On purpose. I&#039;m done with noisy upstairs neighbors. ;)

				When we were looking to buy an apartment we saw a very nice 2 bedroom apartment where the owner, whom I believe was an architect, put in cork flooring. If I remember it correctly he described it as the engineered floating variety that could be laid DIY-style without glue and thereby be easily removed.<br /><br />Probably not a super cheap solution but it was very attractive and warm underfoot, in addition to being sound absorbing. When I did further research I noticed it comes in lots of patterns and color options. Some is even made to look like wood.&nbsp; More general info here: https://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/All-Products/Flooring-Cork#lstBottomCont <br /><br />It may even be possible to put down a thin rug pad first to protect your floors and provide more sound protection?&nbsp; I did research about duro design&#039;s cork options as there were several showrooms in Manhattan that had samples. https://www.duro-design.com/&nbsp; Good luck to you!
