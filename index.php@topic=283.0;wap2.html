			While checking my yahoo mail, I happened to notice a few responses from one of the family groups I participate in regarding a post from Chowhound and how a French/American bistro would fare in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It seems that the original poster was trying to gauge the interest level of Jackson Heights residents because he/she/they may have a possible locale on 37th Avenue for such a restaurant.&nbsp; The Chowhound mods deleted the original post, but a new discussion has begun on the topic.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how long that one will last.&nbsp; So, on the hopes that this entrepreneur may be reading these forums, the question is:<br /><br />Would you welcome a French/American bistro in Jackson Heights?<br /><br />I vote yes.&nbsp; Although I absolutely love all the wonderful restaurants we have in our community, a French bistro would offer yet another option for those days when when one is in the mood for something different than what we already have in abundance in the Heights.

			It would definitely be a welcome addition to our nabe.&nbsp; Any alternative to our precious (though nutrition- and style-poor) local diners would be exciting.&nbsp; I can imagine it would be very popular.

			My vote: an enthusiastic &quot;yes&quot;.&nbsp; The glaring lack of variety among our restaurants and stores is one of the elephants in the living room.&nbsp; That now seems to be changing, albeit glacially.&nbsp; There is a pent-up demand for something more upscale here that finally seems to have come to the attention of entrepreneurs.<br />

			As long as there is brunch there as well, I think it&#039;s a brilliant idea :)

			I vote yes, yes, yes!!&nbsp; Although pastry/bread might draw a slightly different group, I think the enthusiasm for Cannelle indicates a appreciate from this community for French food.&nbsp; We need a few more places to buy high quality french cheeses too!&nbsp;
