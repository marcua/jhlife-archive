				Chopsticks and Marrow features a new Thai restaurant in Elmhurst called Plant Love House (http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/2014/12/plant-love-house-brings-thai-street-food-to-whitney-avenue/).&nbsp; &nbsp;It sounds great.&nbsp; Di Stefano writes that &quot;Woodside and Elmhurst have blossomed into a Little Bangkok,&quot; and I think he&#039;s absolutely right.&nbsp; At this point, I&#039;m feeling overwhelmed by the number of new Thai places I haven&#039;t been able to try yet.&nbsp; As the first step in my therapy, I thought I&#039;d try to make a list:<br /><br />Arunee Thai (http://www.aruneethainyc.com/), 78-23 37th Avenue., Jackson Heights (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/arunee-thai-jackson-heights))<br />Ayada Thai (http://ayadathaiwoodside.com/),77-08 Woodside Ave., Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ayada-thai-elmhurst))<br />Black Thai (http://www.blackthaijacksonheights.com/), 81-16 Northern Blvd., Jackson Heights (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/black-thai-jackson-heights-4))<br />Boon Chu Thai Place, 83-18 Broadway, Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/boon-chu-thai-place-elmhurst))<br />Chao Thai, 85-03 Whitney Ave., Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chao-thai-restaurant-elmhurst))<br />Coco South East Asian Cuisine (http://www.cocoasiancuisine.com/), 82-69 Broadway, Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/coco-south-east-asian-cuisine-elmhurst))<br />Dee Thai (http://www.deethainyc.com/), 46-17 Queens Blvd. Sunnyside (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/dee-thai-restaurant-sunnyside-191))<br />Eim Khao Mun Kai, 81-32 Broadway, Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/eim-khao-mun-kai-elmhurst-elmhurst))<br />I Am Thai (http://www.iamthairestaurant.com/), 49-08 43rd Ave., Woodside (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/i-am-thai-woodside-2))<br />Khao Kang, 76-20 Woodside Ave., Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/khao-kang-elmhurst))<br />Kitchen 79 (http://www.kitchen79nyc.com/), 37-70 79th St., Jackson Heights (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/kitchen-79-jackson-heights))<br />Nusara Thai Kitchen (http://www.nusarathaikitchen.com/), 82-80 Broadway, Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nusara-thai-kitchen-elmhurst))<br />Paet Rio, 81-10 Broadway, Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paet-rio-elmhurst))<br />Plant Love House, 86-08 Whitney Ave., Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/plant-love-house-new-york-2))<br />Playground Authentic Thai Cuisine, 71-30 Roosevelt Ave., Jackson Heights (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/playground-authentic-thai-cuisine-jackson-heights))<br />Ploy Thai, 81-40 Broadway, Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ploy-thai-elmhurst))<br />Sabay Thai Restaurant (http://www.sabaythai.com/), 75-19 Broadway, Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sabay-thai-restaurant-elmhurst))<br />Sila Thai (http://silathairestaurant.com/), 57-17 Roosevelt Ave., Woodside (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sila-thai-restaurant-woodside))<br />Spicy Shallot (http://www.spicyshallot.com/), 77-01 Woodside Ave., Elmhurst (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/spicy-shallot-elmhurst))<br />Sripraphai (http://www.sripraphairestaurant.com/), 64-13 39th Ave., Woodside (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sripraphai-thai-restaurant-woodside))<br />Suki Thai Shabu (http://www.sukithaishabu.com/), 60-15 Woodside Ave., Woodside (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/suki-thai-shabu-woodside))<br />Sweet Basil, 39-28 61st St., Woodside (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-basil-woodside))<br />Zabb Elee (http://zabbelee.com/contents/home.html), 71-28 Roosevelt Ave., Woodside (Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/zabb-elee-woodside))<br /><br />That list seems to dwarf our famous neighborhood&#039;s &quot;Little India&quot; offerings.&nbsp; Did I miss any?<br /><br />Which are your favorites?&nbsp; &nbsp;And who&#039;s going to try them all first?

				wowww, that is crazy. I think Elmhurst is the core, with the ones in sunnyside and woodside also-rans. but...<br /><br /><br />You can add some that aren&#039;t proper restaurants:<br />ThaiThai Grocery (next to that bar, read ahead)<br />Thai Grocery <br />Thai liqour store next to ayada (though the thai selection is very limited)<br />That bar across the street from khao kang<br />that coffee shop across the street from that bar<br /><br /><br />Restaurants:<br />Thailand Center Point (sentimental favorite)<br /><br />Every one I&#039;ve been to knocks even the highest regarded manhattan places out of the water. The 4 or so times I&#039;ve had thai in Manhattan, I just thought it was the most ridiculous thing. Like I was cheating on Kathy Ireland with Kathy Bates. <br /><br />

				I hate to have to choose between Ayada and Zabb Elee (though I make that choice at least once a week and choose differently each time).&nbsp; Both are amazing and--I agree with Jeff and his Kathy conundrum--better than anything I&#039;ve had in Manhattan.&nbsp; Oh, and that Thai bar--it&#039;s called Pata Paplean--is fantastic.&nbsp; Stunning and freaky decor, potent exotic drinks, nice staff and actually pretty good food.&nbsp;

				I would also dare say that the Thai food gets better once you cross into Elmhurst.&nbsp; Not sure why, but the food is spicier, much more flavorful, and tastes more authentic than what&#039;s on Northern or 37th.&nbsp; Thanks so much for putting up this list!&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to check them all off!

				I have tried almost all on the list but some in Sunnyside and Woodside. I think you also miss <strong>Chao Thai Too</strong> which specializes in Thai sukiyaki.<br /><br />I agree that this area serves the best Thai food in the whole NYC area and probably second in the country only to Thai town in Los Angeles (where good Thai restaurants are more spread out) and second in some specialties, say Khao Man Kai to Portland. My personal favorites are <strong>Zabb Elee</strong>, <strong>Khao Kang</strong>, and <strong>Ploy Thai</strong> (not sure about the new renovation though). My Thai friends go to <strong>Playground</strong> and <strong>Sabay</strong> a lot for karaoke after (restaurant) work and their drinking food is not bad. Many think food at <strong>Ayada</strong> is sweet but it&#039;s kind of similar to food in Central Thailand.<br /><br />Personally I like this development, especially if new places focus on different things like <strong>Tea Cup Cafe</strong> (that corner cafe on Woodside Ave), <strong>Khao Kang</strong>, or a few new chicken and rice joints. However, I feel strange that many Thai restaurants inside and outside of this area are actually managed by the same team like Zabb and Spice (very bad in my view). And some seem to have strong connections like Spice and Khao Kang or Zabb and Larb Ubol.

				Thanks Puri, that was very interesting and helpful.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the increasing diversity among Thai establishments is a great development... I&#039;d love to hear any further insights you may have about which places correspond to particular regions and/or styles back in Thailand.<br /><br />It also seems worth noting that the trend hasn&#039;t been limited to Thai cuisine.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a fair number of great Malaysian, Indonesian, and Vietnamese places in the mix as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure whether there is genuinely a broadly diverse Southeast Asian community emerging here, or if we&#039;re drawing immigrants primarily from one place, but they are branching out in their development of restaurants.

				likewise been to about a dozen or so, and found some really, really great ones and only one or two duds. CoCo doesn&#039;t seem a fit to me (self-described Southeast Asian, it seems more Malaysian to me). we&#039;re very lucky to have this bounty -- and i have friends who come from all over the city to eat at quite a few.

				Hi all, <br /><br />I know there have been scattered posts about this previously, but I would love to hear what people&#039;s current Thai restaurant favorites are in Elmhurst/Jackson Heights. A friend of mine recently wanted to come visit and experience the local offerings- I took her to Paet Rio, because it had been on my list to try for awhile, but it was unfortunately kind of mediocre. Should have probably gone to Chao Thai, although we wanted a place where we could sit and have a beer or two with dinner, and Paet Rio has a nice interior for this. We did get drinks after at Pata Paplean, which was great as always. <br />My own list:<br />Khao Khang<br />Chao Thai<br />Kitchen 79<br />Ayada <br /><br />Am I missing any?

				Still huge fans of ayada and 79. They are the obvious go-tos for those in the historic district in the 70&#039;s or low 80&#039;s.<br /><br />Ayada&#039;s portions for delivery are more generous than 79&#039;s..... their catfish salad is ridiculously delicious, their chive dumplings (when fresh eat-in, not delivered) are crispy nuggets of awesome,&nbsp; they had a special - fillet mignon panang curry! - which was out of this world -&nbsp; a few weeks ago.&nbsp; their noodle and curry standards are also excellent. they are&nbsp; expanding next door to get bigger. I seriously think Ayada is a world class restaurant....certainly the best overall thai I&#039;ve had in the USA (including thaitown in LA). <br /><br />79 has delicious draft beer selections, their curries have a great &quot;fresh&quot; taste to them. a truly great local choice (*much* better than the now&nbsp; sadly sugared, weak-sauce westernized Arunee).<br /><br />The more elmhurst-y thais are good, but unless there is a particular dish that ayada or 79 does weakly in comparison to these&nbsp; we generally stick to the more local ones.<br /><br />Zabb elee&#039;s Dark noodle soup is sweet spicy funky and awesome. the other stuff I&#039;ve had there was good but not as memorable as 79/ayada.<br /><br />I miss plant love house. And if you want delicious delicious, delicious early onset diabetes, sugar clubs&#039; deserts are great.

				Agree wholeheartedly about Ayada, which is ridiculously good.&nbsp; Still a fan of Sripraphai after all of these years, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit in the back garden.&nbsp; I really like the atmosphere at Kitchen 79, though I think they can be a little heavy-handed with the fish sauce on some of the dishes.&nbsp; But definitely on the short list of go-to Thai places in Jackson Heights proper.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would add Sompong Thai to the list, especially for delivery (I&#039;ve ordered from them more times than I care to disclose publicly).&nbsp; Nothing too advanced or extraordinary, but they reliably scratch the itch for mid-week comfort Thai food, and they deliver quite quickly since they are right in the nabe.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				we alternate between Ayada and Kitchen 79, depending on the mood. Ayada is overall my favorite, probably the best Thai i&#039;ve had on the east coast, maybe in the whole country. their Nam Tok with beef blood is my fave dish in the whole neighborhood. Kitchen 79, on the other hand, serves a bunch of dishes you don&#039;t see in most Thai places; my partner loves this super funky mackerel dish that&#039;s a little too much for me, even at my most adventurous. but she swears by it.

				Yeah, Paet Rio is surprisingly not as great as the others. You really can&#039;t go wrong though with any Thai place in the area. I&#039;m not sure what the specialties of each place are yet... did want to mention that Ploy Thai is a great one too.

				Khao Khang is one of the best restaurants in New York. There&#039;s just nothing like the quality of the food for the price--and you can pay many, many times more and just not get anyone who can match their sheer ability to cook.<br /><br />It&#039;s also served cafeteria-style so everybody gets exactly the same food--no special menu for perceived insiders.

				This article really just hits the tip of the iceberg. Most of the ones in the area would destroy any thai place in manhattan (excluding considerations for being upscale). Anything in Elmhurst and Woodside is pretty much as authentic as you can get (made for thai, by thai). One of my new years resolutions is to go to Boon Chu more often - it&#039;s always been a favorite but it&#039;s a little too far from me. I have been going to Playground a lot, resulting in my nearly dying from the heat (good for beer drinking though, and the longest happy hour in the city).

				I&#039;ve gone to Dek Sen about half a dozen times and really like it.It started out as a weak copy of Plant Love House but has now really found its voice. My three favorite Thai places within walking distance are Ayada, Khao Kang and Dek Sen.

				The sheer volume and variety of these places is astounding. I would venture a guess that nowhere else in the United States does there exist such a dense and expansive clustering of Thai restaurants and groceries - even Thai Town in LA is dispersed as is the style over there. The intersection of 77th and Woodside alone contains Khao Kang, Ayada, Spicy Shallot, Pata Paplean, Thai Thai Grocery, Tea Cup Cafe, and a Thai salon. A single block of Roosevelt between 72 and 73 features Zabb, Autthouros, Playground, and Jaew Hon. I for one feel lucky to be in the midst of all of this.<br /><br />As for favorites, different places have different draws. I take hardcore food enthusiast friends to Zabb, go to Playground for late-night comfort food and cheap Singha, book Ayada for groups, and frequent 79 for solo lunch and dinner because it has the best bang-for-buck lunch special in addition to an interesting beer selection. Playground holds a particularly special place in my heart, as does the Eim Khao chicken and rice shop down on Broadway.<br /><br />I also second what has been said about Arunee. By far the least inspiring Thai food I have had in central queens, though I still prefer it to a majority of Thai places in Manhattan.

				Just wanted to give a shout out to Sripraphai. I know it&#039;s become a bit of a cliche, and the spice level isn&#039;t the same as it was 17 years ago when I first started going there, but still, many of their dishes are wonderful in their balance and complexity. Plus, it&#039;s one of the few places in the area where in the spring and summer you can sit in a beautiful garden and sip a cocktail before your meal.

It&#039;s 100% doable if the chef has the tiniest bit of a clue on the topic.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been happy with Black Thai for ordering in and Sripraphai for eating out, but a bunch of the Woodside Avenue places, when I asked them, basically said &quot;we don&#039;t want to deal with you, goodbye.&quot; I&#039;d love to have some more options.

				had lunch at Hug Esan; really enjoyed it! I had the roast chicken and bamboo larb- both were great. I ordered the larb medium spicy and it was bracing (in a good way). Chicken skin was perfectly crisp. I hope people will give it a try- note that they are cash only fyi<br />

				Has anybody been to Pulau Pinang? Not Thai but quite delicious regardless and Malaysian food does have some overlap in terms of flavors and ingredients. The crispy pork chop is a personal favorite, in addition to all the fried rice dishes and laksa.

Khao Nom is the latest entrant in the nexus of deliciousness that radiates outward from the junction of Woodside Avenue and Broadway. When I say latest I mean very latest, as in they opened last Thursday. Food critics normally stay away from a place for several weeks before spilling ink, thankfully as a food writer I have no such constraints.<br /><br />When I first heard about Khao Nom—whose name means dessert—I was told that its mainstay would be old-fashioned Thai dessert. So when I visited on opening day I was surprised to find a six-item menu of savories, including something called chan noodle ($11). It’s a generous tangle of chewy flat rice noodles known as sen chan, flavored with chili and tamarind and surmounted by two huge prawns. It comes with a back story too. <br /><br />My pal Joel, a go-to source for all things related to Thai food culture tells me it’s a forerunner of pad thai that dates back to the time when Siam became Thailand and there was a rice shortage. Prime minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram encouraged the eating of noodles and set up a contest. The story goes that the winner of the contest was sen chan (chan noodles) named after the town Chantaburi.<br /><br />Click link at top for full article<br />

				Khao Nom just written up in the NYTimes:<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/dining/khao-nom-review-thai-desserts-queens.html?&amp;moduleDetail=section-news-5&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Food&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;version=WhatsNext&amp;contentID=WhatsNext&amp;pgtype=article<br /><br /><br />I went for the first time last week and loved it! I tried the coconut milk ice cream and the pandan tart. Especially loved the tart. Can&#039;t wait to go back and try more. <br />

				AND we were shortchanged. Dek Sen should definitely be on the list. I also really like Boon Chu and the new noodle place is great too. <br /><br /><br />I think Moo is better than the khao man gai place for specialty places. Also, not a big fan of Paet Rio. But that is only one cisman&#039;s opinion.

				I would also like to give a shout out to the&nbsp; Thai stalls in the new Hong Kong Food Mart in Elmhurst. There is one that sells plates of suckling pig and hainanese chicken that I&#039;m a particular fan of. They&#039;re giving away free Thai iced teas with every order right now, get it while it&#039;s hot. a lot of the places in that mall are going to close in a matter of months but I hope that the two Thai stalls that I have tried will stay open
