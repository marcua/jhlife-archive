				I&#039;m still searching for a good local veterinarian. Have one you like in the area? I tried the one on 35th between 71 and 72nd (or, at least, I think that&#039;s the block) and wasn&#039;t really keen on the care there. So, I&#039;m on the hunt for a new one...especially one that&#039;s good with, how to put this, handling mean old cats with severe attitude problems.

				At the vet on 35th Ave. at 71st, I would only see Dr. Rhiele (not exactly sure of the spelling it&#039;s pronounced &quot;really&quot;).&nbsp; If he wasn&#039;t the one you saw there, you might want to consider trying him.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or you can try Dr. Joanne Seinsheimer at the Astoria Veterinary Clinic on Steinway and Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s little further afield, but she is quite sharp (and caring) and it&#039;s a very quick trip by car ($10 for car service).&nbsp; They have Sunday as well as emergency appointments.&nbsp; Both of these are good local options, depending on the issue, but I also still haul my cats into the city at times when nothing less than our beloved and trusted longtime vet will do.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried Dr. Tello.

				I&#039;ve gone to Dr. Tello with my Cocker Spaniel, and I thought he was really good. They got us in right away and the doc diagnosed the problem and the treatment worked well. I don&#039;t recall him being over-priced, but I was used to prices from the Park Slope Animal Clinic which was never cheap. He&#039;s at 85th st &amp; 37th ave. which is convenient to my apartment which was another plus. We also went to Dr. Tello for our dog&#039;s latest shots and general check up. No complaints there either.

				I highly recommend Dr. Tello [both son and father] at Noah&#039;s Ark on 37th at around 85th St. Dr. Tello also offers holistic advice for pet care. Their rates were appreciably lower than what I was paying in Brooklyn but why I initially switched vets was for the convenience and it turned out to be a good experience. Also, found a cat sitter through them. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; They now charge more for weekend appointments than the cost of a Mon-Fri appointment.

				Someone mentioned Animal Hospital on 71st and 35th ave.&nbsp; I concur...I&#039;ve had fairly decent experiences with that veterinarian clinic through out my repertoire of owning pets, nearly 30 years of experience.&nbsp; A situation required the clinic to recommend an alternative since one my cats needed a complicated medical procedure done to save her life.&nbsp; Other than that, the clinic is thorough and well for most medical care, check-ups, tests, exams and other observations.

				I highly recommend Dr. Tello (the son) as well.&nbsp; We adopted an older dog from a rescue center with several health issues and he always went above and beyond.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard anyone complain that he was &quot;overpriced&quot;; his rates were lower than what I was paying in Brooklyn as well.

				my BF and i have 2 dogs - one is mine, one is his.<br /><br />i take my dog to Heights Vet Hospital (35th Ave and 71st St) - have done so for 7 years.&nbsp; nice enough, easy enough (no appt necessary on saturday mornings), and she is healthy.<br /><br />my BF didn&#039;t like the doctor he got at Height Vet Hospital (don&#039;t remember his name but he is the younger, hispanic guy) and took his dog to AAA Vet Care on Northern between 73rd and 74th.&nbsp; He likes them better and they have taken good care of this health-troubled dog.&nbsp; my ONE HUGE COMPLAINT is that they upsell EVERYTHING and any time i need to take my BF&#039;s dog there in his stead, i have to FIGHT to make sure they don&#039;t give him an unnecessary shot or do an unnecessary test...they try to get you for every dollar and i find that repulsive.&nbsp; martha at the front desk there, though, is the sweetest...my BF&#039;s dog LOVES her.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t say to not go there, but beware of being sold things your pet doesn&#039;t need.

				hello having had just about every pet you could imagine dog/cats/rabbits etc i&#039;ve been to every \vet in the area and manhattan/woodside etc. Hts vet. hospital did a good&nbsp; job on my dog saving her -but only see DR. Riley not anyone else I had the other vet tell me my dog whom was only walked on cement and never around others had fleas (he was lying) anyhow dr cesaer&nbsp; tello on 85 st is a jh native and a wonderful guy very sweet but expensive i had a prescription for my dog he told me to take it to riteaid he didnt have any in his office riteaid wanted 300 dollars plus he is in basement apt with stairs etc i always hear dogs barking down there.&nbsp; i havent heard anything good about the newer place on northernand 70 something. There was another vet on northern and 89 i believe- I did not like him whatsoever it appeared he was faking giving my dog a shot (im not kidding) and he was trying to have me do all&nbsp; these test/etc not very friendly to me or my dog. Now for emergencies I took my catero the place across from target on qns blvd excellent quick service very expensive but it was a sun and my cat couldve died. I usually take the cat to manhattan humane society its cheaper but after my rabbit was neutered he died the same day at home.Sorry to rant!

				We&#039;ve tried several veterinarians in the area for our cats and we&#039;ve been disappointed with their ethics. While we expect them to be profitable, we expect them to put our pets&#039; welfare first. We finally found one we&#039;re thrilled with.&nbsp; Yes, &quot;thrilled&quot;.&nbsp; Her name is Dr. Angela Orobello, and she works at: <br /><br />Queens Veterinary Hospital<br />56-12 Roosevelt Ave., Woodside<br />(718) 672-9722<br /><br />We&#039;ve been there in the past and the service has been acceptable, but Dr. Orobello just returned from maternity leave.&nbsp; We took our 14 month old cat to her this week because he was throwing up for days.&nbsp; She calmed us down and advised us to wait a few more days and watch the tell-tale signs. The cat had swallowed a drawstring which was causing an obstruction, which he finally expelled. She could have suggested a dozen traumatic and expensive tests, but she didn&#039;t.&nbsp; We think we found an empathetic and ethical practitioner and we will follow her wherever she practices.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Does anyone have experience with Elmhurst Animal Emergency Hospital on Queens Blvd? I&#039;ve seen the bus ads for them &amp; they advertise 24 hr care. It would be good to know where to find quality local emergency care when out regular vet is closed. TIA.

				When my dog got lost one time, he walked into a moving car.&nbsp; A couple ran and grabbed him and took him to Elmhurst Vet. Hospt. on Queens Blvd.&nbsp; The Vet on duty checked him out thoroughly (he was okay, just a cut on his mouth) and then the couple called me and I got him back.<br /><br />the charge for the hospt. visit was $100 (which I gave them back).&nbsp; <br /><br />So I would say it was a good place even though I wasn&#039;t there personally.&nbsp; Another time when I thought something was wrong with my dog I phoned them and the person who answered was nice and helpful and said if I was unsure to bring him in.&nbsp; Again, I got a good feeling about the place.&nbsp; So if I had to go there for some emergency, I would go without hesitation.&nbsp; But only for emergencies not regular vet visits.

				For an update-<br /><br />Over the last 3 years, I&#039;ve taken both of my cats to Heights Veterinary and have been very happy.&nbsp; Recently, I found both the assistants and the vet very friendly.&nbsp; &nbsp;They were honest about what older indoor cats really need (vaccines and whatnot) and did not try to sell me unnecessary services or tests as a vet had done when I lived in Kew Gardens.&nbsp; I did also see an injured cat brought in by a good samaritan and the cat was treated immediately and w/o cost.

				I must also comment on Dr. Cesar Tello.&nbsp; I think he is FANTASTIC.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t think Noah&#039;s Ark Pet Clinic is particularly cheap, I also don&#039;t think it is overpriced - especially for the kind of service they provide.&nbsp; Dr. Tello ALWAYS spends ample time talking with me when i bring in my 2 cats.&nbsp; He answers all of my questions and is really helpful - even to the point of explaining specifics about diagnosis, etc (he always likes to show examples of things in medical books, which is helpful and is reassuring to me that he knows his stuff).&nbsp; And it also doesn&#039;t hurt that he has an ivy league degree from Cornell. <br /><br />The facilities, while perhaps are rather small, are still kept very clean.&nbsp; The staff is very pleasant and accommodating and they almost ALWAYS follow up with me by phone to see if my cats are responding well to medication, treatments, etc.&nbsp; They also are very good at reminding me of necessary vaccines and check-ups that are coming up (which some could view as being a money-making strategy for them...but nevertheless, I find it helpful).<br /><br />I really can&#039;t say enough good things about them...you can&#039;t put a price on having a really smart vet who is good at diagnosing problems and truly cares about your pets.

				First, what a great website! Just found it. Been living in the Jackson Heights for 30 years. I have 7 pets: 2 dogs, 4 cats, and a bird named Bubba. I highly recommend Dr. Khadiga Nasr, a veterinarian that has run the&nbsp; the Corona Heights animal Health Center on 108th street and 51st avenue right by the Lemon Ice King. a lot of the Italian-american and spanish-speaking community adore her. I have been going to her for eight years now. her number is 718-592-2022<br /><br />She is easily the most affordable. Checkup is only $25 dollars!!! That struck me as insane because I had been to the other doctors in JH and in Elmhurst and my vet bills were soaring through the roof on really basic procedures. I HaTE going to the vet knowing I&#039;m paying for the leather seats and other frilly things in there ....anyway, I explained that I had lots of pets to Dr. Nasr, and she totally understood and told me about her deal: for a 100 bux, you get four checkup visits a year, and 15% off&nbsp; medication and procedures. I took that deal. Besides the price I will tell you exactly why I go to her: Her personality. she is not some sterile medical doctor type--she is totally energetic, informative, and she talks to my pets the way I do! like the whole goo-goo ga-ga thing lol!! that&#039;s is freaking funny. I bring my kids because I want them to learn about how to take care of animals, and they love her and the four cats she has as her clinic mascots. <br /><br />She told me she&#039;s opening up a new clinic in a few days, I think on February 16th, called Vet Express, or Veterinary Express or something like that. It will be on the other side of Eliot avenue by the LIRR 89-08 Eliot ave. 718-424-2241. Reason for the contact info (which I wrote on the back of a card!) is because its a bit roundabout to find. Its on that block right past the LIE overpass on Queens Blvd by the Queens Center Mall.....like when you go past the Sears auto center going towards rego park. Theres a little block there with stores on it and stuff. anyway, though the other vets are ok, I find her to the be the cheaper and much more interesting vet! My pets are in perfect condition, and with her deal they all see her every three months for checkup/diagnosis--and the procedures are far, far, far cheaper than the other vets and with the same or even better quality of service. Regular checkups seem to me the best way to make sure I don&#039;t spend lots on procedures, so 100 bux is money well spent.

				Hi,<br /><br />I would like to get some current feedback on where to take a puppy.<br /><br />We&#039;ve been to AAA on Northern and have found it to be quite pricey. &nbsp;Following is some info:<br /><br />The puppy vaccinations (puppy plan - to be paid in two installments) totals $325, but the vet found that the puppy has bronchitis and an ear infection. &nbsp;In addition, there is a $70 additional fee to check the poop, and God only knows what&#039;s next after the 21 days of antibiotics relating the bronchitis. &nbsp;<br /><br />Note that the vet mentioned that an x-ray may be required????<br /><br />Best,

				I&#039;m giving another nod to Dr. Tello of Noah&#039;s Ark.&nbsp; He is the best vet that I&#039;ve ever seen in terms of being straight with you regarding necessary treatment, cost, etc.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s a bit pricey but all vet care is.&nbsp; I think the difference here is that he does not try to up-sell you lots of things that you don&#039;t need.&nbsp; He&#039;s also incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and will give you and your pets as much time as you need!

				I wanted to add my recommendation of Henry A. Riehle DVM, Heights Veterinary Hospital, 71-02 35th Ave. ph: 718-639-5210. I went to him with a sick cat. I was expecting the usual overtesting and guilt tripping. Got none of that. Riehle is for real. The place is low key and focused on animals, not people or money. There was mention of a &quot;cat&quot; scan, but I rejected the idea. I researched a treatment and he agreed it was worth a try after a round of antibiotics failed. It worked. I waited awhile to make sure my cat was 100% better. Now, months later, I am confident in recommending Dr. Rielhe.

				Not sure if I should start a new thread, but I figured it could go on this one.<br />Has anybody ever had a dog with a skin tag removed by your vet? My dog<br />has had one since last summer, it&#039;s on her left front leg, pink in color, no<br />bigger then the size of a dime. It hasn&#039;t changed color or size, and it doesn&#039;t<br />seem to bother her, it&#039;s hanging by a thread so to speak.<br /><br />Some people tell me not to worry, that it&#039;s normal. I don&#039;t pick at it of course<br />but I do want it removed whichever way the vet thinks best in a couple of weeks<br />when I go for her yearly vet visit.

				Yes, it took the Vet less then 5 minutes. He gave her a local anesthetic, I was in<br />the room but not looking, these things make me squeamish. I had to go back<br />the following week to get the stitches removed. $50.00 charge for the procedure, not too bad.<br /><br />No way do I advise anybody to remove a skin tag from their dog on their own, you need 3 people<br />for this and you don&#039;t want to risk an infection. Hopefully it won&#039;t come back.

				$50 is very reasonable, I think. &nbsp;And I&#039;d NEVER remove something like that myself. &nbsp;Who knows if it would bleed a lot or cause pain or worse, get infected. &nbsp; I&#039;m glad you went to the vet and had it taken care of. &nbsp;Better for both of you. &nbsp; :)<br /><br />And I like Dr. Riehle a lot, too.&nbsp; My little dog has been sneezing, sniffling, snorting for about 2 weeks.&nbsp; Took him to JHs Vet.

				Just took my cat to International Animal Clinic (89th &amp; Northern) after noticing her gums were getting red and inflamed. A neighbor suggested it and it had been about two years since the last visit to the vet, so I decided to take her in. <br /><br />You know what was great? They didn&#039;t up sell me anything, like our previous vet did. Instead of pushing for a costly teeth cleaning - which requires general anesthesia - the vet pointed us to a liquid we could get at Petco that if used consistently should reduce the plaque build-up and red gums. I&#039;m not enthusiastic about brushing a cat&#039;s teeth every other day, but I&#039;m even less enthusiastic about putting my aging cat under general anesthesia and paying $300-500 to do so, which I&#039;m certain my old vet would have pushed for.

We&#039;re swaddling our cat in a towel once a day and spraying it in to the side of her mouth as we lift up her lips on both side. Then we go in with a q-tip to get the back teeth. We may work up to a little tooth brush, but she&#039;s not exactly cooperating by opening up nice and wide for us, so the lower back teeth are mostly being covered by the upper. We kind of rub it in to the teeth and gums and then make sure she doesn&#039;t have any food for awhile before and after. Hopefully we&#039;ll see a difference in a month.

				I wanted to thank posters for steering me in the direction of Dr. Berman who comes to your home.&nbsp; He is wonderful, I highly recommend him and his staff. They were so helpful I still can&#039;t believe it.&nbsp; http://otgvs.otgvs.com/ (http://otgvs.otgvs.com/)<br /><br />I also had a very good experience with Astoria Veterinary Group on Steinway, they are open late which is awesome.&nbsp; Know it is a VERY busy place.<br /><br />I like Dr. Tello &amp; his staff at Noah&#039;s Ark, but I cannot recommend him.
