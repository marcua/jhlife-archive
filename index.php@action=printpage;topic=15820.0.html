				Does anyone know what work is being done on 80th street between 35th and 37th Avenues?&nbsp; And why aren&#039;t residents informed before major work is begun?&nbsp;

				Is anyone hearing a prolonged sanding noise at weird hours by the Greystones? It went on for a while late last night, and then again early (6am) this morning.

				Verizon is installing conduits for FiOS cable underneath the sidewalk. No advanced notice was given, not even to the residents of the Greystones, however a permit for the work was filed with the city.

				The Verizon crew were cutting a channel into the center of the sidewalks.&nbsp; Len Maniace of the JHBG and reports this:<br />Hello all:<br /><br />Spoke to Parks Department&#039;s chief forester for Queens, who was on site after we notified department and Councilman Dromm yesterday.<br /><br />Verizon contractors were NOT doing the right thing<br /><br />They did not have a permit from Parks,<br />did not have an arborist on site,<br />were working too close to the trees,<br />and cut several roots on trees. <br /><br />Parks stopped work in the area of trees,<br />is requiring an arborist on site before work near trees is resumed,<br />will require contractors to remove asphalt where work has been done to determine if major roots have been damaged. If so, those trees will need to be removed because they pose a safety hazard (at either contractor or Verizon&#039;s expense, apparently.)<br /><br />That Verizon, a huge company that works throughout the city did not have parks permit is pretty outrageous. (They had the required permit from NYC transportation department.) With no paid employees, JHBG knows enough to get a parks permit when it comes to even minor work near public trees, such as installing a tree guard around street tree. <br />Hope they get hit with a fine. Someone needs to send a message to these companies. Last year we had problems with the natural gas company dumping construction debris on 37th Avenue street trees.<br /><br />Thanks again and Happy New Year.<br /><br />Len Maniace<br />
