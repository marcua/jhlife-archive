			Thankfully the First Amendment allows for free speech.<br /><br />Including positive comments as well.<br /><br />Like positive comments for the Open Street of 34th Ave. <br /><br />Thank you both to the First Amendment and the powers that have created the Open Street of 34th Ave. <br /><br />So lucky to be in Jackson Heights for this positive wonderful project.&nbsp; I am so happy to be able to voice my gratitude for their hard work in creating this gift for our community. <br /><br />In my opinion it is the right size. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)
