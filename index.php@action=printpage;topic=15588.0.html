				Okay, so i check on this page every once in a while. Am i the only one who is deeply disappointed by the amount of **** that is posted here? I know that our neighbors and residents have so much more to offer. Recently I had the idea of creating a social gathering/club where we celebrate the talent, innovation and social connectivity of our neighbors. I mean, we used to have a country club and clubhouse right here in the heart of our neighborhood. I feel like we could use a an exclusive sort of social gathering to truly connect with each other. When i walk our blocks I can feel it, we just need the right outlet.......am I alone in this thought?

Many online anonymous forums can sometimes fall into negativity, but I suspect if you ask around, you would find that many JH neighbors have met as a result of this board, or have found out about events or opportunities they might not have otherwise known about. <br /><br />I know there is a team that is developing an initiative called Jackson Heights Creates.&nbsp; They have a FB page at https://www.facebook.com/JacksonHeightsCreates . Also you could check out #jacksonheights tags on twitter and Instagram to see what sorts of creative activities people are posting about.<br /><br />Also, last time I went to Addictive Boutique Winery, the owners mentioned to me that they had just had a very successful reading by a local author and they seemed interested in hosting other sorts of things like that.<br /><br />And lastly, I do agree with you -- there is a wealth of talent in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Good luck with your endeavors!

				Social clubs usually have a physical location for members to go to, whether it&#039;s a country club or some variety of the Elks, Freemasons, or the Moose, so they cost money. <br /><br />I had a little chuckle at the mention of an &quot;exclusive&quot; club, as Jackson Heights was formed to be an &quot;exclusive&quot; community and marketed that way. Meaning, no Catholics, Blacks, or basically anyone not WASP.

				Why not just a bunch of JH residents sit down and talk, just sit and have a convo about things that interest them, find communalities&#039; and maybe, decide to return and continue the convo at a later date.<br /><br />Does that sound possible -- no Facebook, just humans looking at each other, talking, having coffee or tea, and of course, at e77.<br /><br />For me they have the best tuna melt on the entire planet earth...stands up and raises her fists ready to...<br /><br />Does this sound like a possibility?&nbsp; Human beings talking to each other at E77?

				WASP? How did it come to be a Jewish community? <br /><br />(or were those two groups cozy, maybe because of protestantism)

				^The history I&#039;ve read notes that the Queensboro Corporation marketed the community as a &quot;restricted community,&quot; common coded language of the day (from the teens and 20s) letting folks know no Jews, Catholics, or African Americans will be accepted.&nbsp; Social change eventually rendered that obsolete.

				Jews were not allowed to buy in the coops controlled by the Queensboro corporation, but there were other ways in.&nbsp; My grandparents bought a home and my parents, like other Jews, rented.&nbsp; Many Jews purchased units in coops like Southridge and Northridge that were built post-war.&nbsp; I always thought that Catholics were not excluded, but maybe I&#039;m wrong.

				^how old is the Catholic church on 35th avenue? That might help us figure it out.<br /><br />The Fair Housing Act wasn&#039;t passed until 1968, so prior to then I guess sellers and developers could exclude whoever they wanted. Anti-semitism and anti-catholic sentiment had lessened in the public by then, so my guess would be Jewish communities and Catholics had established themselves in JH prior to then.

				Was Edward MacDougall, who started the Queensboro Corporation, Catholic?&nbsp; I always thought he was. His corporation donated the property that became St. Joan of Arc on 82nd Street. Anyway, by the 30&#039;s, 40&#039;s and 50&#039;s, there were many apartments available from buildings other than the Queensboro properties.&nbsp; By the 1950&#039;s there was a large Jewish and Catholic presence in the community.&nbsp;
