			<br />--- Quote from: fishcado on December 06, 2007, 05:34:40 PM ---Have to say the people are at their creative best when describing their &quot;love&quot; for JH. <br /><br />Here are some of my favs:<br /><br /><br />Jackson Heights? Gimme a fuckin break. i grew up in that shit hole, and am happier than ever that I am now out of there.<br /><br />Um, last time I checked, Jackson Heights was a shit bomb. And I last checked about 3 weeks ago.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS POLL??? IT&#039;S A GODDMAN NO-BRAINER!!!!<br /><br />The &quot;hsitoric disctrict&quot; in JH is NOT beautiful, by any realistic sense of the word!!!!. GET OVER IT ALREADY! JH IS A DUMP SLUM.<br /><br />Jackson Heights/Woodside -- best food (if you like cheap fast food garbage) in NYC.<br /><br />and last but not least, this one is the clincher:<br /><br />Crackson Heights FTW!<br /><br />&quot;Shit Bomb&quot; is my new favorite saying.<br /><br />:2funny:<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br /><br />These people who are quoted have a severe case of head-stuck-in-ass.&nbsp;
