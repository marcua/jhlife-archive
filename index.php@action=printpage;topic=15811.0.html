				Thanks to all the people who have expressed their support. <br /><br />Thanks also to the construction tradesmen and suppliers who are making this happen.<br /><br />About two weeks ago, I and one of my partners were at the restaurant when a number of people, passing by, dropped in. It was a delight to meet you and show you how the restaurant is coming together.<br /><br />It&#039;s going to take a bit more time, but we have a great crew working daily, and it&#039;s going to happen. <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Stew<br /><br /><br />

Seafood is tough unless you have a strong sense that the demand is there. It&#039;s too expensive to have and not use. I like oysters, but I admit it&#039;s not the first thing I reach for as a meal. Even when I&#039;m out with friends. Though, I will say it&#039;s definitely a social food. Perhaps it&#039;s something that you trot out only for special event-driven occasions, i.e. Oyster night.<br /><br />Nevertheless, looking forward to it all. I live in LIC now and for every trendy restaurant with good food, there&#039;s one or two trendy restaurants with mediocre food that still charge as if they&#039;re serving up Michelin-Star quality. I have faith that won&#039;t be the case here!

				since i am the one who started the now-locked &quot;other&quot; thread a couple of months ago, i want to say that i stand corrected, and am intrigued about what you&#039;d discussed, menu wise, when you initially announced plans to open here. especially a tourtiere (which will likely have to wait until this coming Christmas season).<br /><br />i apologize for guessing you&#039;d given up the ghost; a twitter account hadn&#039;t been updated in 14 months, nor had a facebook page, which had your initial run of updates, largely decor-driven, as well as one very positive review from someone who apparently really enjoyed dining at swim two birds in the summer of 2015. mea culpa on that front. <br /><br />hoping the road is smooth from here on.

				I would say try it one night a week, make sure&nbsp; people know about it from the menu and facebook, and see if it works. If there is doubt that it could work, just look at Case del Chef in Woodside which appears to be doing well - which I do think has to do with their cuisine being quite safe yet upscale.

				I want to make something clear.<br /><br />The delays in opening our restaurant are the sole result of building violations by other tenants in the building and an allegation by a city building inspector that was overturned, in its entirety, on appeal.<br /><br />When our alleged violation was overturned on appeal, somebody in the city suddenly discovered, within a couple of weeks, in the building department archives, violations in the building generally that went back to 1999, which is 18 years ago. The issue was outdoor signage. These issues should have been addressed by the landlord, and by the then tenants, but were not. <br /><br />As a result, we were denied a work permit again.<br /><br />After a long appeal process (second appeal), we were finally given another work permit, but in December 2016 we were told that we would have to make a further application in order to continue work past January 1, 2017. So we engaged counsel yet again. <br /><br />During this experience, we contacted our city councilor&#039;s office and were brushed off.<br /><br />No need to tell me to hire a serious high end lawyer. That&#039;s done. <br /><br />Just posted this to make it crystal clear what has been going on.<br /><br />When we open, I&#039;ll have more to say about this, partly to help other people who want to open legitimate businesses in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Meanwhile, we are continuing to turn the space into what I believe will be a beautiful, if small, restaurant. I&#039;ll leave this issue to our lawyer, and refrain from saying anything else about this absurd situation until we open. <br />

				The one part of this history that is amusing is that we have torn down the signage, apparently also in violation of city requirements, over our space. <br /><br />Why? Because the signage is awful and is inconsistent with the original design of the building.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the city is putting us through hell, and costing us money, to get rid of it.<br /><br />Truly amazing.

				I will add this. At one point, we were alleged to be in violation of the building code on signage because we took down the illegal box sign put up by the prior tenant, which, apart from having electrical deficiencies, was, like every other storefront on that block, inconsistent with the building&#039;s original Art Deco design.<br /><br />When we took down the box, it was alleged that what remained was a wire exposed to the outside. It didn&#039;t occur to the city inspector to ask, when we removed the box, whether there was any longer any power to the wire.

				I think you&#039;d fare better if you kept more to yourself. A run down of the facts that any of us could find if so inclined through publicly available records is probably not a big deal -- in one post rather than a series of posts *after* you&#039;ve said you shouldn&#039;t reveal too much. But posting about the petty comments of your inspector about filing criminal charges of harassment probably isn&#039;t helping you. <br /><br />You can be right, or you can get your restaurant open without needling the inspector who already has a personal beef with you. What do you want?

				^indeed it does. It&#039;s quite clear you are more interested in being right than in meeting your stated goal of opening a restaurant. You may still be able to open the restaurant in spite of your need to incessantly air every accusation against the inspector assigned to your case, including those which can&#039;t be supported by facts, but you aren&#039;t doing yourself any favors by doing so.

				Captain Flannel, you seem pretty interested in being right, too. I guess we all are. As for me, I say let&#039;s just let the man get on with it and make the decisions he wants to make, whether or not you personally think they are all well-advised. None of us can really understand what he&#039;s been going through to achieve his vision (which I think a lot of us want very much for him to achieve), and he seems to have been pretty admirably dogged until now.

				I&#039;d like the place to open too. That&#039;s why I wish Stew wouldn&#039;t come on to a public forum to post things that may antagonize someone who has to deal with to get his restaurant open, and who could potentially still have the power to throw a wrench in the process. <br /><br />Again, a run down of publicly available facts for those who are interested? Seems reasonable. Describing a petty and rather silly comment about &quot;filing criminal charges for harassment&quot; (which, BTW, the district attorney decides, not joe schmoe who probably doesn&#039;t even know what NY State&#039;s harassment laws are), not a good move if you have to continue to deal with that person in order to open your restaurant.

				Thanks Palermo, for the entertaining riff.<br /><br />You could bend the genre a bit and allow the food to talk.&nbsp; The food items are the real heroes and heroines here. I&#039;m certainly rooting for them to appear and they deserve a chance to be heard/tasted.

				Seriously, let&#039;s talk about why the Democratic Party was paying Novo, every month, for state level and city level functions.<br /><br />We&#039;re talking about a restaurant that paid next to no rent, that had constant neighborhood issues with noise, drugs and weapons, that was constantly in arrears of its cable payments (patrons were told over and over that the big TVs couldn&#039;t deliver because the cable company was incompetent) and that eventually walked from a monthly rent of about $3500.And yes, I know what rent they were paying. <br /><br />What was going on here?

				If the service is good, I&#039;m fine with it. Waiting tables is a hard job, so if the waiters feel they are not being compensated properly, the service will probably suffer. So if the service is good, I will assume they are being compensated properly. <br /><br />So with that being said, the only reason I am in favor of the no-tipping policy in general is so cooks get paid more. I worked as a cook for three years and before that I worked as a waiter. Both are hard jobs, but being a cook is much, much harder. Ironically, cooks get paid much less than waiters. Coincidentally at many restaurants the cooks are immigrants and the waiters are white american citizens. So, if no-tipping evens out the pay for the cooks, I support it!

				I agree with Benny 100%. The reason to eliminate tipping is to equalize earnings between front of house and back of house.&nbsp; Particularly at restaurants that are upscale, tipping since it&#039;s based on a percentage of the check means that waitstaff can rake in the money while the invisible linecooks and dishwashers who are more likely to be immigrants and non-white are paid much much less.<br /><br />The existence of tipping in so many venues is a peculiarly American phenomenon and its history has something to do with new money Americans&#039; desires to ape European aristocratic custom, iirc. The more restaurant owners move to building the cost of labor into the price of the product, and providing a living wage for all employees, the better. So, Stew, I say go for it!

				We would really like to open as a non-tipping restaurant.<br /><br />But the reality is that people disagree on whether this is acceptable, and we will need to be on an even keel early on.<br /><br />As a practical matter, it is likely to be a goal, six months to a year into operation.<br /><br />As some people have pointed out, this is an important issue regarding payment of kitchen staff, who under New York State law do not share in waiter tips.<br /><br />We haven&#039;t made anything close to a final decision on this, but it is an important issue, not just in terms of our economics as a restaurant, but in terms of fairness to our kitchen staff.

				Good luck with finishing your project, Stew. <br /><br />And as in any project, take no notice of those who criticize...<br /><br />They are doomed to criticize because because they can&#039;t create!<br /><br />Creating takes positive work, ability and focus.

What *is* problematic is forming a bias and making assumptions about youth being the requirement. That&#039;s not the requirement. Experience (or lack there of) is. A 40 year old looking to earn a little income on the side and willing to take a part time job at a restaurant as a barback or busboy is likely just as inexperienced as a high school kid. The hours available, hourly rate, etc. is naturally going to filter out the people with more experience in hospitality who can, based on their experience, get a higher paying job. Stating an age requirement is unnecessary, and a violation of federal labor law since 1967.<br /><br />If a business is truly committed to training students, the business can look in to formal internships associated with culinary and/or vocational schools. These programs likely require more of the business if the student is earning credit for the work than just advertising an part-time entry level position and hiring the best candidate.

Strew has addressed here that he is more interested in hiring and training people with no experience in hospitality, which hopefully means he is open minded about what a person he is hiring for an entry level position can look like (i.e. a couple of grays, crows feet, etc. shouldn&#039;t automatically dismiss a candidate).

Our designer has scotched the idea of an awning, and we agree, even though every other shop on the block has an awning. Lots of discussion about security, whether we need a gate at night, which we don&#039;t want, vandalism with keys on open glass, etc. Talking to other shop owners about this, and will speak with our precinct. Lots of detail issues. <br /><br />But it&#039;s looking good :)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				i&#039;d agree about a full coverage gate; what about (and i know i am not using actual construction/building terms) one of those latticework ones? those don&#039;t look nearly as bad, and they would protect the glass.

The floor uses three colours of stone. This iPhone photo makes the space look narrower than it is, although it&#039;s not exactly a ballroom. The structure on the left foreground is the bar. The new storefront goes on this coming week. Good progress on the walls and ceiling, but wallpaper, mirrors, tile on the back wall, sconces still to come.

				Thanks amsci, Cassat and Shelby2 for your comments.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to the new storefront next week. The front will be flush (as the building was originally designed, with no overhanging big box &quot;advertisement&quot;), and there will be a wider entrance for everyone&#039;s benefit, including wheelchair users.<br /><br />Very, very happy with our interior designer and lighting designer (both from the theatre world - the lighting is going to be great), and the labourers, carpenters and trades specialists making this happen.<br />

				What a transformation! We were not fans of the previous tenant and never went there during their tenure, but we loved the place before that, Mehfil, and I still remember what that looked like. You would never guess it is the same space. <br /><br />Very much looking forward to this! We&#039;ve only lived in JH 5.5 years, and one of the things we loved when we moved in was having Mehfil so close by--we are on 76 St--then they closed, alas. <br /><br />Will love having Swim Two Birds nearby. One wish: I hope your menu will include at least some simple preparations without heavy, complicated, spicy sauces. We both need to be careful with our diets for health reasons, and that can be challenging vis-a-vis the cuisines featured in this neighborhood. We love Indian food and Thai food and Peruvian food, etc., but we cannot eat these foods all the time. When you are trying to cut down on fat and carbs--it&#039;s hard around here.<br /><br />In some restaurants, it&#039;s difficult to find anything light to eat.&nbsp; Everything seems to come with a cream-based sauce, or a sugary sauce, or is, to my mind, overly complicated. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m looking forward to your opening.

				Hi ljr,<br /><br />Jackson Heights is well served by Asian and South American restaurants and we will not be competing with them. My background is in French technique, and we will be serving contemporary American food.<br /><br />That said, I hope to go to South America in the next year to learn about some interesting developments in Latin cooking, but these are very different from the traditional Latin food offered here.<br /><br />You will find that our menu is consistent with your desire to cut back on fat and carbs.

				Hi Simka and dssjh,<br /><br />We&#039;re going to do the soft opening without music and see whether guests are happy with it.<br /><br />We will indeed have a number of maritime dishes on the menu. After all, we are living on an island :)<br /><br />The crew were putting the finishing touches on the new front today. The green shed will come off as soon as they are ready to get rid of it. As mentioned previously, there will not be an awning/box sign above the entrance. The idea is to keep the front in tune with how the building was originally designed. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				music/sound is a very interesting element in this mix - kind of like lighting (although *no* lighting is really not an option). <br /><br />i&#039;m sometimes hesitant to go to one favorite place - Osteria Morini - because of management insistence on ramping up decibels to the point where everyone needs to shout. haven&#039;t noticed that at Michael White&#039;s other places, though.<br /><br />&quot;energy&quot; is organic. it&#039;s there or it isn&#039;t. and the *kind* of energy you want to have in the space is a consideration, too. hope you find the mix you need there.

				A small insight into creating a restaurant...<br /><br />This week, our crew will be working on wall finishes.<br /><br />Today, we held up some wallpaper against a wall to judge how it will look.<br /><br />We immediately realised that it looks amazing with the floor tile.<br /><br />We also immediately realised that it will put us well on the way to a space that some guests, especially young people, may find outside their comfort zone.<br /><br />Given that we want this to be a neighborhood, somewhat casual restaurant, this is a real issue.<br /><br />We spent some time talking about how important staff will be in how the restaurant is seen/welcomed if we continue on our current road on finishes.<br /><br />In the end, we decided to go ahead with the wallpaper.<br /><br />We will find out after we open whether this was the right decision. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				A more direct version of my last post...<br /><br />Today it hit home that we are way offside how restaurants in the area are done.<br /><br />If we are successful, others will follow.<br /><br />If the food and service are good and we fail, we will lose our shirts and learn that we should have stayed with our original intention to do this in Manhattan or Brooklyn or Long Island City, all of which we considered in detail before deciding on Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Our designer, who is in his mid-twenties, and in whom we have great confidence, believes that the design will work for young people as well as older people, and won&#039;t be seen as too formal/fancy. But he lives in Manhattan via Key West.<br /><br />We&#039;ll know soon enough :)<br /><br />

As you suggest, we have to get the food and service right.<br /><br />As a vocal critic in this thread has just pointed out, it&#039;s going to be a tiny restaurant. Only 45 seats including seven at the bar. No TVs either. And no music at levels that make it necessary to raise your voice to talk with your partner 18&quot; away.<br /><br />Works for me, as a cook and resident of Jackson Heights for over 15 years, and hopefully for our guests.

				There has been a lot of progress on the restaurant since we invited people to drop by during Gay Pride day two weeks ago.<br /><br />For those who are interested, we&#039;re going to do another open house this weekend or next.<br /><br />Might be of particular interest to people, including students, interested in interior design.<br /><br />This time we&#039;ll have a couple of the custom chairs that North Carolina&#039;s Artistic Frame has made for us on the floor. <br /><br />Will post when tomorrow.

				Just want to confirm that we&#039;ll be at the restaurant tomorrow from 1 pm to 2 pm if anyone wants to drop by and have a look.<br /><br />The green shed front is still there but not for structural reasons. A lot of work has been completed since Pride Day, including the new entrance.<br /><br />For us, tomorrow will be the first time that we see how Artistic Frame&#039;s matching table and bar chairs look in the space. Fingers crossed that they&#039;ll look as good as we hope. <br />

The new front is installed. It&#039;s there to dissuade potential vandalism.<br /><br />A few posts ago, ljr said that he/she was by during the day and just walked in. Apparently Vivian, our on-site manager and a great guy, didn&#039;t eat ljr for lunch :) Don&#039;t hesitate to say that I said it&#039;s OK, but I doubt that will be necessary. The crew are pretty proud of their work, and deservedly so. <br /><br />So maybe just open the door and walk in (albeit past a bit of plastic at the moment), introduce yourself and have a look around. If you do, I should point out that the ceramic/stone floor is covered at the moment to protect it, but everything else is visible.<br /><br />Onviously, the guys have work to do, but the occasional quick look around isn&#039;t going to disrupt anything. <br />&nbsp;<br />

				Hi amsci,<br /><br />I just realised that based on the history of our dealings with the local building inspector, I need to scotch my last post. It is entirely possible that he will slam us with another stop work order because, for example, you are on the property while our crew are doing what they are doing at the moment, which is painting and applying wallpaper. <br /><br />I would be delighted to show you around if you contact me by personal message.<br /><br />Stew<br /><br /><br /><br />

				True. However, I must say I am losing hope. It&#039;s so mysterious. I thought I heard that the renovation looked virtually complete. So what could be happening? &quot;After the holidays&quot; was the answer when my husband met the owner and asked when the place would open. I&#039;m guessing that was in October, and there has been no activity since the shed came down probably around that time.

				I heard that STB got its liquor license long ago. Not sure about Queensboro. I remember hearing the latter was slated for a summer 2017 opening. In both cases, it seems like renovations are substantially done, from what people have posted. Has it been about 3 years since each of these announced they were in the works? It&#039;s one of the strangest things I&#039;ve ever heard of. Maybe STB is in some sort of legal limbo regarding the building violations? And maybe if there is legal action going on, rent doesn&#039;t have to be paid? Otherwise I cannot fathom how these owners can go on paying rent on businesses that haven&#039;t opened.

				Yes Romeo&#039;s is weirdly inactive. I just hope it is actually an Italian restaurant and not a glorified pizza takeout place--which seems to be what opens here generally. With a counter and TVs and a Coke machine/cooler in the dining room, and fluorescent lights and plastic chairs and cafeteria-like trays. Like Due Fratelli, which has a full menu but is hardly a real sit-down restaurant like Armondo&#039;s. Those seem to be very rare around here. We could use a few more.

				Petegart--dream on...I also long for a place like this, but the deck seems to be stacked against it. We seem to only get new dining options with TVs, Coke machines in the dining room, fluorescent lights, no alcohol, plastic chairs and trays. Some would say this is what this neighborhood can support/is known for/really wants--unpretentious, low-cost, diverse cuisines, etc--and not &quot;gentrified&quot; places like the planned STB and the also long-awaited Queensboro. For that--go someplace else, they would say, and have said here, over and over again. They feel it&#039;s the first step to JH becoming like a suburban mall, as part of Manhattan are now resembling (I&#039;m thinking of the Upper West Side). I think that&#039;s ridiculous. We used to have Armondo&#039;s on 37th, which had white tablecloths, traditional service, a full bar I believe, and no TV that I can recall. It was there for many years--did that ruin the neighborhood? We have E77, which is very popular and has a more refined vibe, craft beers, wines, etc. Has E77 ruined the neighborhood or run all the diverse food options out of town? But anyway--it does not seem to be happening, with both these places moving forward at a glacial pace. Who knows why? Frustrating!

				Hi there,<br /><br />I actually met the owners (Rory &amp; Stew) around July. They had decided to move forward with the restaurant, and subsequently recruited me to build the website. However, after I sent a mockup, Rory said he&#039;d get back to me and simply never did. We did have a final exchange in which I asked if the project was moving forward, and he responded with a request for more time.<br /><br />There has been no word since from either my part nor his. This makes me think the project has been scrapped. I hope both gentlemen are in good health.<br /><br />Don&#039;t have any have hard feelings, just posting cause I see that the thread is still active.

				Interesting to hear about the website. My husband says he met Stew in E77, I think around early November, and was told the place would open &quot;after the holidays.&quot; It sure seems like it&#039;s dead now--it looks abandoned, with obviously no activity there at all, and after all the erratic on-and-off postings from Stew, the total silence seems ominous. I&#039;d be surprised if this did come to fruition now. All signs seem negative to me. It&#039;s a shame, that&#039;s for sure.

				Couldn&#039;t agree with you more&nbsp; Jeanette.&nbsp; I remember when expresso 77 was asking for donations for their expansion.&nbsp; Here is a guy who went through the expense of trying to provide a service/space&nbsp; that people are clamoring for.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see the harm in asking, particularly given the egregious behavior of many of the commercial landlords.

I&#039;ll get right on that as soon as you google the word empathy. <br /><br />Last time I checked it is possible and legal to donate to both for profit start ups and to not-for-profit organizations, and I have donated both my time and money to the latter (on an on-going basis in some cases). And yes, crowdfunding for start ups has been a thing for sometime now. I know that Ayn Rand wouldn&#039;t approve of this, but then again, she probably wouldn&#039;t approve of most of what goes on in our neighborhood.

Or perhaps she just did it to try to help him and he wasn&#039;t much involved in the idea. I have no idea if this campaign is legit, but I did check FB for Stew Wadden and looked through his friends list and he does have a friend (presumably his sister) named Jo Wadden. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if I will donate. I did donate $25 to E77 when they had their expansion campaign, and I feel I&#039;ve already benefited from that given the arts programming that they are now able to do in the larger space.<br /><br />Here is the gofundme link in case anyone wants to check it out. https://www.gofundme.com/swim-two-birds-co-stewart-wadden

				I agree that there is nothing outlandish about donating to help startup businesses that you want to support for whatever reason and that there is nothing morally wrong with it vs putting all your donations towards nonprofits.<br /><br />It looks like the GoFundMe is a friends-and-family oriented effort by the sister that Stew may have nothing to do with. The notion that it could be a scam seems to me extremely far-fetched. It is based in Canada, where Stew is from, features a photo of Stew inside the renovated space--how would a random scammer come up with that?-- has posted donations from people who seem to be well-wishing friends, etc. Probably it&#039;s his sister just wanting to find a way to help, and he is not involved at all. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s possible that sometimes these fundraising things ARE scams--I experienced that once. It was for a product that sounded like an improvement on existing products and purported to be one of those things where your donation helps them manufacture it and get the company going, and you get the product in return for a donation that exceeds what the actual cost will eventually be. <br /><br />I donated, received the product, hated it, then started Googling and found that this was not a new product at all--it had been around for years and had a number of people posting critical remarks about it, as well as some probably phony endorsements. It seems like the manufacturer renamed it, pretended it was new, and did this phony GoFundMe campaign. Interestingly, I was not the only sucker--even in my small apartment building. I saw the product parked next to our trash cans one morning, where I had been planning to put mine, and had a moment of thinking &quot;Wait--did I put this thing here and forget I did?&quot; But no, a neighbor had also bought it and quickly discarded it!

				i certainly wish Stew well, but if someone has spent literally years on a project, stopping and starting numerous times with very vague explanations and going radio silent for long stretches, i have doubts about the viability of the whole thing.<br /><br />in no way do i think the campaign a scam or anything onerous, but if the owners need five grand now, who&#039;s to say they won&#039;t need another ten in October? the profit margins in the restaurant business are notoriously thin, and even if all the people who&#039;ve posted saying that they&#039;d be regulars eat there two or three times a week, the cash flow might not be that terrific.<br /><br />i hope he can open and thrive. and it seems as if his cooking skills are top notch. but i wonder if there&#039;s enough business savvy on the team to make it work.

				Thanks to dssjh for the initial search and GFM find.<br /><br />I want to say to Stew, if he&#039;s reading here, that you can show good faith by opening the kitchen for catering purposes, or offering for sale a specialty item like the Christmas pie. If the space is ready, you could open for private events. At the very least, come back here to post your progress (and I would emphasize <em>just</em> your progress).<br /><br />History aside, an effort like that on your part would make the impression that the neighborhood is looking for.

				That is really too bad. I think opening and running a restaurant is very tough, and you have to have a lot of money and a lot of experience--or know how to get the right kind of guidance if you don&#039;t. It looks like the necessary expertise or guidance was missing, and maybe also there was a lot of bad luck involved. Sure is disappointing.

				That space was empty for long stretches--or maybe that was the other food place that is now closed for repairs, it says on the window. And the two previous restaurant tenants occupying that space since I&#039;ve been living nearby don&#039;t seem to have done well there, didn&#039;t last very long. And like the rest of the city, JH has many empty storefronts that seem to stay that way indefinitely.The STB saga should have been a reality TV show. What a story.

				Hey, it ain&#039;t over til it&#039;s over. It does not appear that you can actually say they have been formally &quot;evicted.&quot;&nbsp; Rather, it looks to me like they have been served with a notice of petition for eviction. They could have a defence to interpose or have counterclaims. They could get an adjournment. <br /><br />I must say, I have found it a bit incredible to see the large variety of strong opinions offered in this space on so many aspects of this undertaking, when we really have no idea how much we even know. I personally assume there is quite a lot we don&#039;t know.

I have two friends who are chefs that opened restaurants in Detroit and Chicago. For each of them, choosing the place settings, chairs, etc. was one of the first steps. They felt that it would be easier, and offer more flexibility, to design the space around those things rather than trying to choose the &quot;finishing touches&quot; after the space was renovated. I also know an interior designer who has had a role in several restaurant openings in NYC where they proceeded in a similar fashion. She mentioned to me that this helps to create a more unified environment from a design standpoint.<br /><br />In any case, I can&#039;t imagine how devastating it must be to put so many resources, both financial and emotional, into a project and then have it fall through.

				JH Resident--there are plenty of fairly costly restaurants in JH that are doing just great. There are more than enough customers for them--not, of course, the very low-income residents you are referring to. Every retail outlet does not have to be geared to every single person living in a neighborhood. And we have options for everyone here, including the many food carts, the fast food chains, the small, inexpensive eat-in places--and the pricier places like Armondo&#039;s, El Chivito D&#039;Oro, Uncle Peter&#039;s, the various steakhouses, etc. You think these higher-priced places have no business being here because there are many people who can&#039;t afford them?

				Laughable that anyone considers those restaurants as costly. Those are moderately priced. High end with high end decor restaurants&nbsp; like Stew was building do not exist in JH. Of course we never will know how much a plate would of cost because it never opened. We will never see a Major high end restaurant open in JH because they study the demographics from the census before they invest millions. They look at the average income, percentage on public assistance, etc. Same with the stores on 82nd Street. This is why we get only low end stores like Old Navy. If you want really nice clothes you need to travel outside the neighborhood.

				JK Resident-it&#039;s equally &quot;laughable&quot; that you somehow assume you know what the STB price point would (it&#039;s &quot;have&quot; by the way, not &quot;of&quot;) been. It&#039;s as if you looked at the decor and thought, golly gee whiz, that place must be a hundred bucks a plate! I agree the decor was a bit over the top, but Stew had said he wanted it to be somewhat &quot;casual,&quot; and I was assuming it would be no higher priced than the places I mentioned. Of course it would not be appropriate to install a very high-end Manhattan restaurant on 37th Ave in JH. And of course I know that there exist higher-priced restaurants than what we have here. But we do have many that are not at all cheap--and similar to many in Manhattan in terms of price.

				by JK Resident&#039;s standards, there are no high end restaurants anywhere in Queens. these are comparatively costly for *most* people. not as &quot;high end&quot; as a 300 pp omakase, but costly for someone who&#039;s bringing home a middle class salary. $150 for dinner and wine for two is not something i can lay out every night, or, really, every week. those who can can also probably afford an Uber to get to a place where pricier food can be had in loftier surroundings.

A high end French restaurant never sounds like its going to be within the financial reach of most people in general. My experience with French cuisine is that although excellent, its a bit more of an acquired taste tham say &quot;American casual,&quot; Chinese, and Latin options that are more common in the neighborhood. The restaurant business is very challenging and many new restaurants tend to fail within two years of opening. So, in my opinion, I think that Swim Two Birds, if it had opened , might not have been a financial success although excellent cuisine might have been served there.

				Wasn&#039;t Swim Two Birds going to be a bistro? I thought that was the idea. Important to remember, bistros by definition means modest. Looks like the Queensboro will be opening soon, and they are describing themselves as a bistro as well I think. So we&#039;ll see.<br /><br />Sure, anyone who could afford a $700K apartment 4 years ago can no doubt eat at a bistro frequently.&nbsp; But also, let&#039;s remember that someone who bought a $700K apartment four years ago wasn&#039;t buying a one bedroom, and because there are fewer multi-bedroom apartments than one bedrooms, there is greater competition for them which bumps up the price. I just think we shouldn&#039;t forget that just because apartments are selling for a lot today, that doesn&#039;t mean the majority <br />&nbsp;of the neighborhood is moneyed. Truth be told, if I were looking to buy today, I wouldn&#039;t be buying in JH because I couldn&#039;t afford it now. <br /><br />

				I would also be looking forward to it--I was a big booster of STB-- if I fully believed it. Too many strange things have happened without plausible explanation. And the most recent statement from the owner regarding what else needs to happen and the assertion that the place will be opening--well, it&#039;s just not very persuasive, doesn&#039;t ring true.<br /><br />It reminds me of a situation a family member went through when payments were due him and the person who owed the money just kept saying things to the effect of &quot;Don&#039;t worry--it&#039;s on its way! I was just waiting for a loan to come through, which happened yesterday. It will be in your account this Friday, I promise!&quot; They money never arrived. I think the person actually believed what she was saying--because otherwise, she&#039;d have had to admit to herself that her business was failing-- but none of it was true. And it took my relative a long time to understand that nothing this person--a longtime colleague--was saying to him was true. <br /><br />I will be thrilled if I turn out to be wrong and STB opens and thrives. I&#039;d certainly be an eager customer.

				Anyone holding onto hope for this--I commend your superior ability to maintain optimism. I think there is something seriously wrong with this situation that does not bode well. I would be very surprised if this ever happens. I did, however, feel the same about The Queensboro--and that did happen, so I don&#039;t know. I just don&#039;t get how these things can take years and years to come to fruition.

				Stew should do a pop up event at The Queensboro! Or a guest chef gig at Addictive Fine Dining.<br /><br />He could still sell those pies through some other venue or online. <br /><br />There are ways. Stew hasn&#039;t been receptive to creative marketing. <br /><br />He should return (or make good on) the locally-sourced gofundme funds. <br /><br />Stew is our neighbor. We should still find ways to support him if not at least in our hearts. He should do the same.

It was a notice from the Fire Department to arrange for an annual inspection of the kitchen. The notice includes the statement that it is unlawful to operate commercial cooking equipment without a permit. At the moment, there is no cooking equipment, commercial or otherwise, being operated.<br /><br />As you may have noticed, there is quite a lot going on with the signage on various storefronts on the building. This has to do with corrections of historic signage violations. I am unable to do anything until that work, which has nothing to do with me, is completed. I&#039;ll leave it at that.

				Actually makes sense, looks like the leases are not being renewed so the building can be sold and redeveloped. <br /><br />After many years of much neighborhood battling, I envisage another massive 6 story building there, exactly like further up 37th Ave.<br /><br />The buildings along 37th Ave are not Historic District and so can be redeveloped is my understanding.

				^nope, it&#039;s actually about manipulating someone to question their reality - how they perceive things, if their reactions and emotions are valid, etc. So, when you tell someone to &quot;settle down&quot; over a normal reaction (and in this case, a very mild one), that&#039;s a manipulation tactic to try and make them and others question if their reactions are valid.
