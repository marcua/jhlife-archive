				Hi, I&#039;m super excited to have received an arts grant by the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs! The next step is to secure a low cost storefront rental for the month of September. <br /><br /><strong>--&gt; Do you have an available space? Know of one? Any suggestions?</strong><br /><br />My proposal is to offer an open studio, in a high traffic area of Jackson Heights, where I’ll be creating a new body of work. <br />In the process, I hope to engage the JH community and encourage creative expression. <br />At the end of the pop-up, the resulting work will be installed at Espresso 77 for 1 month, kicking off with an opening reception.<br /><br />I have already reached out to my local politicians, the 82nd BID and I&#039;ve called some realtors, to no avail. Here is a link to the Facebook event, assuming we can make this happen :) https://www.facebook.com/events/2099140786838498/ (https://www.facebook.com/events/2099140786838498/)<br /><br />(https://i0.wp.com/derickmelander.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ceaselessly_Broken_and_Reconstituted_sq.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1)<br /><br /><hr /><br />The gory details:<br /><br />Project Title: To Live is to Leave Traces<br />Project Overview: A pop-up studio, open to the public, in a high traffic area of Jackson Heights. I create a dozen or more new works, extending my practice in multiple, novel directions. At the end of the pop-up, the resulting work is installed at Cafe 77.<br /><br />A. Project Duration:<br />I have an exhibition scheduled with Espresso 77 for the month of October. <br />- August 26-30 Set up space, prepare<br />- September 2-27 Open studio duration<br />- September 30-October 1, Remove materials and restore space<br /><br />B. Space Access:<br />My goal is to be in the space during peak commuting hours and to keep a regular schedule.&nbsp; <br />1. Set hours would ideally be 8am-7pm Monday-Friday, with approval. <br />2. I would like to hold events on Thursday evenings, going no later than 10pm. The schedule is not set but I was planning on activities such as readings, performances and talks. Again, this if flexible, not a deal breaker. <br />3. I am an insured LLC, I will purchase any necessary insurance riders to cover the project. <br /><br />C. Space Requirements:<br />1. 200 square feet, but nothing is too big.<br />2. A space that is in a highly trafficked area with windows allowing people to see in.<br />3. A sink or access to one elsewhere. I can run home for bathroom breaks.<br />4. Electricity (I can provide my own lighting if need be).<br />5. A securable space with a locking door.<br />6. Approval to paint the walls white if need be (my paint or provided by owner, whichever is preferred).<br />7. An open space, I will supply everything I need (2 tables, 2 chairs and a shelf/cabinet for tools).<br />8. Approval to move existing furniture or fixtures to storage or to move behind a curtain if need be.<br />9. Permission for people to enter the space, experience the art making process and interact with the artist.<br />10. Free or at cost rent as this project is focused on serving the community. (I already have an art studio elsewhere). The grant I have received is for 3k, mostly reserved for logistics, materials, services and a modest artist fee. <br /><br />D. Engagement Strategies:<br />I will use my creativity to encourage involvement. I can provide as much detail as you would like. Here are a few strategies:<br />1. Free coffee in the morning while supplies last (a thermos of drip coffee via Espresso 77).<br />2. Video projections on the windows or interior walls<br />3. Non-obtrusive sound that can be heard in the immediate area of the space. Thematically it could be Salsa one day, NYC 70’s Minimalism another, Trending on Spotify the next, commuter’s choice..<br />4. Performances by other artists that respond to the work I am doing in the space. <br />5. I will occasionally stand out front and invite people to come inside and provide feedback. <br /><br />E. The Work to be Created:<br />Rather than exploring new themes, I will mostly be focused on exploring new formats and techniques. <br />1. Lightweight, small to mid-size works that hang on the wall. <br />2. Work with acrylic paints using traditional and non-traditional processes. <br />3. Dip textiles in plaster and other stiffening agents to create free-form works.<br />4. Sew and weave fabric scraps.<br />5. Glue/grommet whole garments together.<br />6. Create small stacks of clothing that can function as stools. <br /><br />This project is made possible (in part) by the Queens Council on the Arts with public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.

				&nbsp;This project sounds great and I wonder if some of the empty spaces in the Roosevelt Ave subway<br />station would work? Or any new construction that is underway like the behemoth apt building that<br />is going up on Roosevelt and 69th Street? I think they are said to have a &quot;community space&quot; in<br />that complex. Maybe some of the nightclubs too might be open to having this art work for a month.

				Thanks @itsit! I tried really hard to get a space in the subway, but even after an introduction by NYS Senator Toby Ann Stavisky, many emails/paperwork, the best the MTA could offer was the going rate of 8k per month. My grant is for 3k. <br />I did walk over to the new big building you mentioned, but they don&#039;t have windows yet on the ground floor, doesn&#039;t look like they will be ready. <br />--&gt; Anyone out there have a lead on a ground-floor space in JH? I just need a month. I have 3 weeks left to make this happen. With Regards, Derick

				There seem to be some new empty storefronts along 37th avenue (a cell phone store most recently closed...hola mobile I think). There&#039;s also been a space open for a long time on 82nd street in the Heritage Tower building adjacent to the Rite Aid. That place would be good bc it&#039;s super bright and painted white.

				Maybe contact one of the real estate companies. They might see some value in this. Might even do it for free.

				Perhaps you might partner with the Jackson Heights Library?<br /><br />A lot of people frequent the library.

Where I actually got a great haircut yesterday :) Here is the event description, I&#039;ll also post to Activities now. <br />To Live is to Leave Traces takes place in a storefront art studio, open to the public, in the heart of Jackson Heights. During the month of September, the artist will: <br />– Create a dozen new works, extending his practice.<br />– Actively engage with local organizations (eg. The 82nd Street BID, The Renaissance School).<br />– Encourage passers-by to come in and provide feedback.<br />– Invite guest artists to work alongside him.<br />– Host weekly events in the evening. <br />– Strive to be collaborative and inclusive.<br />He hopes that this project will strengthen the creative fabric of his community. At the end of the pop-up, the resulting work will be exhibited at Espresso 77, a local cafe. <br />For updates, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/events/2099140786838498 and instagram.com/derickmelander
