				is your section of the neighborhood as noisy as mine? I think it&#039;s a wonderful tribute to the emergency and essential works! Cars and bus drivers also participate. It&#039;s also great to see your neighbors at the windows and know they are ok. I really hope the spirit of thanks and unity long outlives Covid-19.<br />

				Yes in my part of the neighborhood (91st, 34th ave), we also cheer loudly, it warms my heart. I am so proud of our community.

				I wish our block was a bit noiser- 37th and 73rd. We don&#039;t cheer every night, but it sounds like it&#039;s just one other person in the building facing us (although bless their heart, that person is going all out with the pots and pans!).

				&nbsp;Not so much of a response in the lower 70&#039;s. A few miscellaneous people and it just doesn&#039;t gain momentum except a couple of times when cars honked down the street or people walking adding more lift to the effort. What seems to make it work well is being in the proximity of others also clapping and things are more spread out here.

				Lots of enthusiasm at 73rd and 35th every night. Cowbells, pots and pans, yelling and clapping, sometimes music. Loud enough even with the windows closed to startle my cat into hiding haha.

				The 7 pm Jax Hts cheers for healthcare workers made it as the opening call-in segment of the NPR Politics podcast on Thursday.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the link:&nbsp; https://www.npr.org/transcripts/848670475<br /><br />Along 37th Avenue between 79th and 80th streets, there&#039;s a joyous racket every evening. A young man plays the Star Spangled Banner on his trumpet. There&#039;s a vuvuzela, bells, whistles, and plenty of pots, pans and ladles.&nbsp;

				I put on my mask and walked my block (80th Street from 37th to 35th Avenues) during last night&#039;s celebration, and recorded it live on Facebook for my family, friends, and other loved ones outside NYC. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the link: https://www.facebook.com/steven.tomkiewicz/videos/10217698577926115/<br /><br />[My first time using Facebook Live, so I didn&#039;t realize using the front-facing camera would invert the images, but you can still hear the enthusiasm if you turn the volume up.]
