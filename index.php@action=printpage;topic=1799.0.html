				Hi Folks,<br /><br />I am considering a job in Connecticut and pondering the feasibility of a reverse commute from JH to Connecticut via whitestone bridge (driving). I would like to take mass transit but metro north doesn&#039;t go to where this job is. <br /><br />Currently live in Brooklyn and can&#039;t bring myself to do the suburb thing in CT with respect to personal preference and my wife&#039;s career (very much based in Manhattan). JH seems like a nice compromise distance wise and everything I&#039;ve seen and read from multiple visits and research make it an attractive option. The price of real estate also seems much more reasonable as well. <br /><br />Was wondering if anybody does that commute and can offer sage words of advice. Much appreciated.

				I have an apartment in Jack Hts and a house in Conn.&nbsp; I go up there during the week and on weekends.&nbsp; I go over the Triborough Bridge instead of the Whitestone since Whitestone always seems to have construction and it&#039;s only a couple lanes where as Trib., even with construction, has more lanes.<br /><br />I go just past New Haven on I95 and on a good day it&#039;s an hour and a half.&nbsp; There&#039;s always some place where traffic slows down for no apparent reason but the ride doesn&#039;t seem long to me.<br /><br />don&#039;t know if this helps you.

				Hi there.<br />I live in CT and my boyfriend lives in Jackson Heights.<br />I work near Danbury and when I drive down to JH on Friday afternoons I usually hit traffic on the Hutch and it takes me about 2 hours.&nbsp; When I drive back to CT on Sunday nights it&#039;s about 45 minutes (to Norwalk).&nbsp; It&#039;s do-able but really a question of what you can get used to.<br />Where in CT is the job?<br />The pros are that you would be going against traffic but the cons are that mileage is something you can&#039;t overcome.<br />A coworker of mine did the Jackson Heights to CT commute for a few months and I think it was about 1.5 hours to 2.&nbsp; I can get more info from her if you&#039;d like.<br />I hope this helped.<br />Jessica
