					I have asked our Councilman whether the DOT has assessed the increase in traffic, congestion and noise that is now prevalent along 35th Avenue and likely Northern Boulevard especially beginning in the mid-afternoon through about 7pm.&nbsp; Now that cars and school buses have to contend with double-parked trucks and cars on 35th Avenue, as well as the Q49 bus, we have hours of congestion, noise, and danger to pedestrians.&nbsp; So while the DOT has calmed 34th Avenue, it has made 35th Avenue that much more treacherous for about five hours each weekday.&nbsp; With 34th Avenue no longer a through street the traffic has and will go to alternate east-west avenues... it will not simply disappear.&nbsp; What is their solution to the creation of additional noise, congestion, pollution and danger on 35th Avenue?&nbsp; What can/will the DOT do about this???&nbsp;

					Thirty years ago, the JHBG first launched its Historic Jackson Heights Weekend highlighting our unique garden community.&nbsp; And over the decades people have come from far and wide (and, of course, close to home) to attend the exhibit of original photographs and ephemera, a slide presentation, the garden tour and the walking tour.&nbsp; Attendance has grown to a total of over 300 for all events over the last few years.<br /><br />Sadly, the pandemic forced the cancellation of the June 2020 and June 2021 events. However, we are preparing for a “slimmed down” version this September (only the Garden and Walking Tours). We invite you to join us.&nbsp; Tickets are $10 for each tour.<br /><br />Garden Tour: September 18th from Noon to 4pm (raindate: September 25th)<br />We anticipate 12 gardens participating this year.&nbsp; And since we have never had a fall garden tour, here is a chance to see what they look like as the summer comes to a close.&nbsp; Tickets can be purchased at Espresso 77 (35- 77th Street) beginning in early September.&nbsp; On the day of the event tickets can be purchased in front of Community Church, on 35th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets between 11am and 2pm.&nbsp; We hope to have some books and T-shirts also available for sale.<br /><br />Walking Tour: September 19th at Noon<br />Tours will meet at 11:45 in front of the Community Church, on 35th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets).&nbsp; We ask that you reserve in advance by calling 347-766-9129 so that enough guides are available to keep each tour group to under 20 people.<br /><br />POST THE FLYER IN YOUR BUILDING!&nbsp; THANK YOU.<br />

					Councilmember Francisco Moya covers 82nd Street, not Councilmember Dromm.&nbsp; So if you have concerns about the conditions on 82nd Street - as it relates to the men hanging out and the proliferation of street vendors - then you MUST contact Councilmember Moya as follows:<br /><br /><a href="mailto:fmoya@council.nyc.gov" class="bbc_email">fmoya@council.nyc.gov</a>&nbsp; <br />his staff person Phiviline Solano at <a href="mailto:psolano@council.nyc.gov" class="bbc_email">psolano@council.nyc.gov</a><br /><br />His district office: Tel: 718-651-1917<br /><br />Please contact his office on a regular basis. As the old adage states: The squeaky wheel gets the grease!<br />That is not to say that expressing your concerns to Councilmember Dromm is not warranted, so do both!!

					ClydeM, thank you for a thoughtful, informed, and accurate&nbsp; take on the issues facing our neighborhood (and our city and country as well).&nbsp; We can and should no longer look the other way, or make excuses for both our current situation, and the problems that preceded the pandemic.&nbsp; We have to make our voices heard since, unfortunately, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.&nbsp; That is what 311 and our elected officials are for.&nbsp; Perhaps you should run for office!

					KGDHP is absolutely right.&nbsp; As they say on the subway, if you see something, say something.&nbsp; I have found it much more efficient to make your complaint using the 311 online portal:<br /><br /><a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/search/?q=" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://portal.311.nyc.gov/search/?q=</a><br /><br />You can enter the issue in the search box, and then click on the type of complaint.&nbsp; Follow the directions and enter your complaint. You will likely need the nearest street address.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is crucial to use 311 because otherwise, our fair city and the NYPD will claim that no complaints were ever made.&nbsp; If you submit your complaint you are given a number that records the complaint.&nbsp; The city will/may finally respond to issues when there are too many complaints for them to ignore.<br /><br />Also, call your elected officials, or email them.&nbsp; It is your right to hold them accountable.&nbsp; Don&#039;t wait for someone else to do it.

					Indeed, all of our elected officials should be continuously held accountable for issues that negatively affect our quality of life.&nbsp; This year presents us with the perfect opportunity to ask ALL of those running for City Council precisely what they will be willing to do to address the chronic problems - drugs, prostitution/sex trafficking, public intoxication, etc. - that have plagued Roosevelt Avenue for DECADES.&nbsp; The problems have been staring all of us in the face for years, and little seems to be done.

					Over the summer I emailed all of our elected officials about sanitation issues along 37th Avenue, and other concerns owing to the pandemic.&nbsp; The only one who NEVER responded was Ms. Ramos&#039; office.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know why.&nbsp; Obviously way too busy doing other things than listening to the needs of her constituents.<br /><br />Pathetic and sad.&nbsp; We need new blood and primaries each election!&nbsp; Choice matters.

					Clark&#039;s opened up in the late 1920s, I believe, and was a mainstay on 82nd Street for over 70 years.&nbsp; It closed a few years back, but the brass letters: C L A R K &#039; S still remain on the sidewalk in front of the original entrance.&nbsp; The Weiss family ran the business all those years, and their son Mark, lives in New Jersey now.

					<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Below you will find my commentary from my latest quarterly Jackson Heights Real Estate Report, the most authoritative assessment of current sales activity in the 11372 zip code.&nbsp; To subscribe and receive the full, three-part report, simply go to <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br /><br /><br />We now have two quarters showing the effects of the pandemic “under our belt.”&nbsp; The results, thus far, are not very surprising:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales volume has declined.&nbsp; Given the relatively low volume of houses sold each quarter – generally between five and fifteen, in both good times and bad – not much change was evident.&nbsp; However, the drop in sales was significant for apartments, which fell by almost two-thirds compared with the third quarter of 2019.&nbsp; The third quarter is typically when properties listed during the busy spring selling season will close.&nbsp; Being that we had almost no spring selling season, the decline was to be expected.&nbsp; Unwelcome, but expected.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average sales price remained relatively stable.&nbsp; The main reason for this is that the vast majority of properties that closed in the third quarter (July through September) were priced and went into contract in the first quarter.&nbsp; Real estate activities, you may recall, came to a virtual halt in the second quarter (from mid-March through the end of June).<br /><br />With that said, what the future holds, remains materially uncertain.<br /><br />Five houses sold in the third quarter, down from ten a year ago, but up from three in the first quarter.&nbsp; Average sales prices fell between 5.5% and 10.5% for one-family houses.&nbsp; Two-family house prices were flat compared to 3Q2019, but rose by over 17% versus the second quarter.&nbsp; Again, low sales volume tends to magnify changes in average sales prices – especially if a particularly expensive or inexpensive property closes.&nbsp; Year-to-date, a better barometer of market conditions, sales volume declined by over 42%, to 19 houses.&nbsp; Average sales prices were down slightly for one- and three-family houses, but climbed by over 11% for two-family houses.<br /><br />Third quarter apartment sales declined in all four categories: in total by 65% compared with the year-ago quarter and by 14% compared with the second quarter.&nbsp; The sharpest decline, of just over 77% versus one year ago, was for prewar elevator cooperatives, our “bread and butter” apartment type.&nbsp; Sales results were mixed versus the second quarter.&nbsp; Compared with 3Q2019, average sales prices rose only for postwar cooperatives, advancing over 16% (this property type has always had the lowest average sales price).&nbsp; All other categories declined between 0.8% and 14.5%.&nbsp; And relative to the second quarter, sales prices rose for prewar and postwar elevator cooperatives, by 5.2% and 0.3% respectively.&nbsp; Year-to-date total apartment sales fell by 44.1%.&nbsp; Average sales prices were relatively stable for all cooperative types – ranging between (0.6%) to 5.4%, but fell by 9.2% for condominiums.<br /><br />For the fourth quarter, sales volume for houses and apartments may rise a bit, given that sales activity will have been possible for six straight months.&nbsp; Average sales prices may trend downward as inventory, especially for apartments, continues to rise, and buyers are increasingly confident that they now hold “the better hand.” <br /><br />Finally, the following paragraph, taken from my second quarter commentary, still holds true:<br /><br />It will take a few years to determine if, after a generation of renewal and success, cities – with their density, diversity, cultural attractions – continue to attract young people and start-up businesses.&nbsp; If working from home becomes more permanent, the long commute into the city will be less of a concern.&nbsp; All in all, a large number of factors will come into play which will help determine what the future will look like.&nbsp; Just as it has for the last 100 years, the quality of our housing stock, a true neighborhood feel, and convenient transportation alternatives will continue to serve Jackson Heights well.&nbsp; But given the continuing economic dislocations, the path ahead remains uncertain, not just for us, but for everyone.&nbsp; Stay tuned. <br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Please feel free to contact me with your real estate needs, and referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br />78-27 37th Avenue&nbsp;
