				Hello members,<br /><br />I am a graduate student in animal behavior with research experience, and an intern with the ornithology dept of a major zoo. I have lived in JH for just over 3 years now, and have sighted at least 2 possibly 3 raptor species on and around the buildings in the neighborhood. Some of these buildings appear to have potential nesting areas for these birds and was wondering if anyone out there has noticed any active or abandoned nests on their rooftops. <br /><br />I would be very interested in possibly organizing a future census of nests, depending on the feedback and cooperation of residents of JH. <br /><br />Hawks, and other raptors are not only beautiful creatures worth protecting but may also be important consumers of vermin species. I ask that anyone with SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON NESTS post a reply to see where we can go from there.<br /><br />Thanks all,<br /><br />J

				Hi J,<br />Over the last month or so a hawk has shown up 3 times in a tree in our courtyard at Dunnolly Gardens.&nbsp; Each time he or she has been harassed by crows.&nbsp; Eventually the hawk either makes a jab at one of the crows or flies off to the East.&nbsp; <br />This is not the exact information you asked for, but might be of interest as another sighting.<br />It was quite a thrill to see the hawk here.<br />

				back in the mid 90s, my ex and i owned one of the &#039;spanish houses&#039; on 75th street and we had a family of hawks who nested in the then-unscreened top floor &quot;porch.&quot; they were beautiful, but had the annoying habit of dropping unwanted leftovers -- mostly squirrel tails, once a part of a possum, down the chimney and into our fireplace flue.<br /><br />i would guess that places with similar upper floors --the towers, a couple other buildings in te low80s, might have nests.

				I have seen hawks on a regular basis in my backyard. They sometimes make this high pitched sound which can wake you in the morning. While I have never thought to look for a nesting place, the next time I see them, I will give it a scan. I&#039;m on 86th between 34 and 35 Avenues.

				Hi J, <br />There are at least one pair of Red Tailed Hawks living in JH- I saw them Monday while waiting for alternate side to end. The male perched on the cell phone antennas on the building at the North/West corner of 79th and 34th. No idea where their nest is.<br />yance

				Good evening all,<br /><br />I apologize for the lack of correspondence, but oddly, this thread disappeared for some time shortly after I posted and I assumed it was taken down by a moderator. Imagine my surprise when I logged on again yesterday. <br /><br />In any event, as I mentioned in my initial post, I am a grad student in animal behavior and I am interested in cataloguing (at least) the occurrence of raptors in Jackson Heights. I do appreciate all of your input thus far.<br /><br />Yesterday afternoon, I spotted a hawk flying just above the buildings on 80th St between Roosevelt and 37th Ave. I have already observed red-tailed hawks (fairly common in urban areas), at least one immature sharp-shinned hawk (less common, especially in urban areas), and kestrels. The latter are tiny falcons that are beautifully patterned and fairly easy to identify. They can nest in the tightest spots, so they also do well in urban areas.<br /><br />I would be very interested to know if there are any peregrine falcons in the area as well.<br /><br />At present, I&#039;m checking with local wildlife agencies and authorities to make certain that any census I decide to undertake is not in violation of any laws.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />With that said, one important disclaimer here:<br /><br />While I&#039;m certain that you are all responsible citizens, for my own piece of mind, I would just like to caution anyone against any type of intrusive investigating that may inadvertently harm birds, their offspring, or themselves. Again, I&#039;m sure none of you would do this, but it would be irresponsible of me not take the precaution of making this expressly clear.<br /><br />One preliminary question that I do have, is how one would go about getting permission from landlords, co-op boards, etc. to do some exploring in buildings. After all, I certainly respect the fact that no one wants some stranger roaming around their rooftops. At present, I am just asking, because as I mentioned there may be legal issues at the municipal, state and/or federal levels that need to be considered beforehand. But, at the very least it would be good to know that building residents and administrators are amenable to this type of work.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, all of you who have photos, please post them if you can. If posting them for public view poses any issue, let me know and I can make arrangements to receive them via email. Please note, that these will be used as visual references to gain some idea of species diversity, and WILL NOT under any circumstances be used by me for publication or personal gain. <br /><br />Once more thank you all for your help. I will be in contact again very soon.<br /><br />J&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Wow!&nbsp; So I guess it was a hawk I saw the other day!&nbsp; It was chased by crows who were going nuts into the courtyard trees at 81st and 37, and they were cawing like mad.&nbsp; The hawk finally gave a squawk and flew away and the crows followed.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t manage to get my camera in time and they were pretty far up in the trees.&nbsp; But it was super cool!

				Madalyn-<br /><br />Merlins are actually small falcons (not hawks), which are very similar to the American kestrels I mentioned earlier. They are smaller-bodied overall, however.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is your neighbor certain this is what he/she saw, because if so, thats a great find given their somewhat limited distribution in the U.S. If your neighbor is an experienced birder, I trust that he/she did. <br /><br />Would you mind inquiring when and where they spotted the bird(s)? I would much appreciate it.<br /><br />Also, if he/she has friends who are also birders, their input would also be welcome.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />-J<br /><br />

				You should check out this photo album of hawk sightings in Jackson Heights. http://jjackflash.zenfolio.com/p243285907<br /><br />It was linked in an old thread here about hawks.&nbsp; If you want to read the old threads, go to the search button and type hawk and see what comes up.

				Saw what I thought looked like a small hawk or falcon this morning by the Greystones.&nbsp; It was at a bit of a distance so I couldn&#039;t get a good look. Seemed most interested in pulling something out of the ground and not the young squirrels running around.

				The Merlin was around in January and was identified by a guy i know who was doing the kestrel count for the city (he also does central park birdwalks) <br />The kestrels like the top of roosevelt terrace and later in the day the school on 87th st and 37th ave. They have been around for a few years but they don&#039;t nest in either building ....the red tailed hawks i see in spring and fall... The only nest i know of is the one in the Unisphere at Flushing Meadows but that is too far away ....there is also a Cooper&#039;s Hawk that likes to sit on buildings between 37th &amp; roosevelt near the pigeons by the 7 train. I have never seen a peregrine in the neighborhood.....mike

				Have seen a peregrine falcon twice in Hampton Court. The first time it was standing on the courtyard grass, enjoying a pigeon breakfast. The second time it flew into a tree near our window and seemed to be looking for something similar.

				There is definitely a hawk in residence near to the Elm Ct.&nbsp; Yesterday 12/21 it landed in the center of the Elm Court garden and spent a good 40 minutes eating something.&nbsp; I took a picture but only had my iphone so not much good for identifying anything.&nbsp; Again today 12/22 I saw it land in one of the tree tops of the courtyard with another catch.&nbsp;

				We have a kestrel who comes around every few months on 85th, 37th. The squirrels run and the other birds go silent and sure enough it&#039;s around. Last was a few months ago. Munching and dropping huge pieces of entrails. (rat, mouse?)
