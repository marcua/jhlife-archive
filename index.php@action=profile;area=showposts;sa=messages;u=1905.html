					As I told my kids recently, in the days before iPhones we did not record every moment of our lives. Cameras came out on special occasions -- birthdays, weddings...&nbsp; As a teenager with a decent camera I never felt the urge to photograph the stores on Roosevelt or 37th because I just assumed they&#039;d be there forever.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; I rode to the 78th Street Park (now called Travers) and the place was unrecognizable to me. I think only the handball courts and baseball backstop remain unchanged from 50 years ago. I wish I would have taken some shots of the park back then.&nbsp; With that said I will look through my boxes and see if anything turns up.&nbsp;

					Other cool toy stores were the one on 37th across from the Post Office - they had Corgi, Matchbox and those small British&nbsp; soldiers&nbsp; - and a hole in the wall place in the 74th Street Station. If you entered from the 37th Rd entrance you&#039;d hit it.

					Roller hockey at the 78th Street Park (we never called it Travers) was great. A fine dust, probably from the wearing down of our wheels, formed a nice fine layer that helped the puck move smoothly.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t have much equipment then, and helmets weren&#039;t invented yet but injuries were minimal. Lots of fun.

					For those of us who played ball at the 78th Street Park in the &#039;60s, the Garden School was a bit of a tease -- wide open, beckoningâ€¦ and off limits. Whenever we could not get space at the 78th Street Park&nbsp; -- and that meant both main fields, the kiddie area and even the lower area (pool) we&#039;d head over to 145. If that was taken, we climb the fence at the Garden School and get some ball in until we were kicked off by the guards. Playing at the Garden School was also the first and only time I ever played ball on a non-asphalt surface until high school.&nbsp;

					&nbsp;My years at PS 69 were great and I had wonderful teachers - with the exception of 3rd Grade when I had Mrs. D (I will not use her name here out of a sense of decency).&nbsp; Three incidents stand out: During a penmanship lesson (yes that was a subject back then) we were leaning script and the first letter we learned was e. This was followed by i and then t. The assignment was to write an entire page of these three letters. I did that and then showed some initiative by linking the three and spelling &quot;tie.&quot;&nbsp; I was so proud of myself. Mrs. D walked up and down the rows inspecting our work and when I pointed out how I linked the letters and spelled a word she yelled at the top of her lungsâ€ WHO TOLD YOU TO LNK THE LETTERS&quot; and promptly ripped up my paper.&nbsp; Good encouragement for learning.<br /><br />On an afternoon in late November, I went to the bathroom and some of the older kids were standing around talking in a shocked manner -- President Kennedy was shot.&nbsp; I went back to class and told Mrs. D, who then proceeded to ream me out in front of the class about how foolish I was to listen to rumors. A few minutes later the news was shared with the school. She never apologized or even acknowledged her mistake. <br /><br />Finally, it was the last week in June â€“ you remember, when school was basically over and they didnâ€™t know what to do with us, so they invented activities and filled the time with nonsense.&nbsp; At 2PM we were marched down to the cafeteria to find, the tables filled with books -- mostly discarded textbooks and library books. We were told that we could take any book we wanted.&nbsp; My friend and I walked around and around looking for a &quot;cool&quot; book on something like sports, rocks, planes...&nbsp; Mrs. D came over and us what was taking so long? We told her we were looking for a really cool book. She yelled at us to &quot;find a book and get the hell out of here!â€ <br /><br />My friend and I looked at each other, grabbed a book and left the building. We had had a few early dismissals over the previous two weeks so this made sense. The next day we arrived at school and our classmates told us we were in major trouble for leaving school.&nbsp; We had to go to the principalâ€™s office and were interrogated by him individually.&nbsp; He then called Mrs. D down and we told our story in front of her. She denied it and we both emphatically jumped all over it.&nbsp; She hemmed and hawed a bit and clearly the principal believed us. We were dismissed and she had to stay behind. She returned to the classroom a bit shaken.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve kept these stores to myself for 47 years. Thanks for allowing me to vent. <br />

					37th of course!&nbsp; I have a great memory&nbsp; but just can&#039;t tell a 4 from a 7 lately.&nbsp; There was also a kosher deli on that block.&nbsp; I also remember Star Liquors on 74th between Roosevelt and 37th-- the only place where we 15 year olds could buy. We played handball for money in the 78th St Park, would buy a few bottles and ride our bikes out to the World&#039;s Fair at night to celebrate.

					I certainly remember Shelby&#039;s -- and the Toddle House.&nbsp; Was Wexler&#039;s there in 1954? SW corner of 76th and 34th --an appetizing store - lox, smoked white fish, pickles and shoestring licorice.&nbsp;
