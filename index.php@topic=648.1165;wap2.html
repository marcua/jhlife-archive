			<strong>JHResident</strong>:
			<br />
			It&#039;s too soon to actually get the last word, but I just want to wish all my fellow JH Residents the best in the New Year. We may not agree about 34th Ave and Diversity Plaza, but we agree that we&#039;re going to miss visiting this site to find out new restaurants and what&#039;s going on and who is opening in the old space and where we can find a decent haircut! I wish everyone continued health and hope to bump into you on the street some day if I ever leave my apartment again. Stay well!

			&nbsp;Amen JH Resident. Agreement was not always the goal in my personal postings. The ability to say one&#039;s thoughts in an open air, though online, forum was invigorating and something that gave a good deal of insight and pleasure throughout the years. None of the other venues online has even come close to the level of thought provoking discourse that has occasionally happened here over the years. Wishing everyone well in their new exchanges. <br /><br />&nbsp; And for the record, tweeting and Trump go together in my mind. Let&#039;s not go there please! Can Shekar get a new outlet for his non tweety constituents? Town crier style?

			Farewell JH Life! I will very much miss you.
