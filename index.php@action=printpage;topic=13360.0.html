				I grew up in JH and remember two Old European-style bakeries, Bauer&#039;s and Shelley&#039;s, both in the 80s. I believe one of them was near 82nd St. and Roosevelt, but I don&#039;t recall the location of the other. Does anyone out there remember them? The quality of the backed goods was outstanding.<br /><br />Also I noticed a thread from several years ago regarding stores that used to exist on 74th Street. When I was in high school (1964-68), there was a French restaurant near Roosevelt on 74th, on the north side of the block. <br /><br />Maria

				I remember both fondly.<br /><br />Shelley&#039;s was a wonderful bakery It was on Roosevelt between 82nd and 83rd. It was always backed and made excellent things. I remember their rye bread with seeds and amazing cookies. Also remember the little alcove where I sat and watched.<br /><br />Bauer&#039;s was on my corner (85th and 37th). It was wonderful. I remember their fantastic cheese cake, flat brownie cookies and my very favorite the orange flavored cookies. I remember walking to school each morning and passing Bauer&#039;s while they were baking. The aroma was amazing - I could almost smell it now.<br />
