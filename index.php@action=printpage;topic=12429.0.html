				Hi<br />I&#039;m looking for someone to clean our one bed apartment. <br />I tried Apple Eco Cleaners .. but&nbsp; they charged what turned out to be $70 per hour. <br />I&#039;d rather try someone else.<br />Any suggestions?

				White Glove Elite 212-684-4460.&nbsp; Named the best cleaning service in by NY Magazine so many years in a row that they had to start a &quot;classics&quot; list to give some other companies a chance.&nbsp; The reason the business does so well is because 1) they pay their cleaners the most of any company, 2) they are honest, kind, professional, and have integrity, 3) they hire a lot of actors as cleaners.&nbsp; I live in JH, I have used them and I have worked as a cleaner for them -- they&#039;re great.&nbsp; There is a 4 hour minimum, and I think it ends up (with tax) around $100 for 4 hours, you provide the cleaning products.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget to tip your cleaning if you like the job they did!

				Cindy Lucombe has been cleaning my apartment for years and does an excellent job.&nbsp; Call Cindy at 347-262-6050 or email her at cindyluco@hotmail.com .&nbsp; Cindy&#039;s regular house or apt cleaning is $25/hr with a minimum of three hours.&nbsp; I personally pay her more than this because she does such great work, is very friendly, and is worth higher pay. Unusually difficult jobs may have a different rate.<br /><br />Ron Mintz<br />
