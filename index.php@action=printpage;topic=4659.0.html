				Someone in my building lets their dog pee in the stairwell (at least I hope it&#039;s a dog). I find this really disgusting, particularly since I sometimes take the stairs and accidentally step in it.&nbsp; I would like to somehow get this person to stop or at least reveal their identity to the board. The super knows it happens and also seems frustrated by it. But he hasn&#039;t been able to do anything about it either. Has anyone experienced a similar problem? Does anyone have any suggestions?

				Awful.&nbsp; Someone should type up a note and put it on the wall requesting that the behavior stop immediately.

				Yeah, the board knows. It happened over the winter too, and the board posted fliers. It seemed to stop for awhile. But then it started up again recently. There are safety cameras on every floor, but not in the stairwells. I imagine installing them is too expensive of a solution. I just find the whole situation appalling and offensive. Who treats their own home like that?

				Can it be that the dog is elderly and can&#039;t hold its bladder long enough to make it outdoors?&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case, it&#039;s the dog owner&#039;s responsibility to clean-up the mess.<br /><br />Maybe new fliers can be distributed stating that fines will be levied for these types of infractions.

				are you really sure its dog urine? Years ago we had a mentally challenged&nbsp; neighbor who was urinating-they blamed the buildings dogs but I guess through cameras found out who the culprit was. It could also be someone with a gripe.
