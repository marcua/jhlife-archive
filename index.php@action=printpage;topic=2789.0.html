And if you are living there, are you a new resident, or did you grow up there? And since you have seen&nbsp; pictures of what&nbsp; Jackson Heights was years ago, what is your opinion about what Jackson Heights is today?

To tell you the truth, I&nbsp; did not go around 35th Ave.&nbsp; I only went as far as 37th. Ave. When I lived there I didn&#039;t have a car. I used to work in Manhattan, and I lived on 72nd. St. Between 41st. Avenue, and Woodside. I used to walk to 82nd. St. and shop at Fields, and the Boutiques on 82nd. And I used to walk to the train a couple of blocks to go to work. This is all I know about JH. And I used to go to the restaurants on Roosevelt Ave. and 82nd.St. I used to love that neighborhood, to me, working in Manhattan all week long, going there after a day&#039;s work, and on week-ends, it was like going to a suburb. but we noticed that the neighborhood started to change, and got out. 35th. Ave is already far away from the trains isn&#039;t it? What kind of public transportation do you have there? Honestly, I have been keeping an eye on the neighborhood hoping it will change. The problem right now is that I will be afraid to take the trains, or walk by myself on the streets. I wouldn&#039;t feel safe, probably because I am a woman I know I have to watch out where I live, I cannot have my husband with me all the time. What I have seen in the trains is very different now than what it used to be. There are a lot of people living there who no one knows who they are.

It&#039;s a very residential, safe and middle class area. 37th Avenue is populated with storefronts, restaurants...etc.<br /><br />The area you used to live in is dense and too populated for my taste. If you Google Map 35th Avenue or 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights and select &quot;Street View&quot;, you&#039;ll see the type of area it is. It&#039;s pretty safe here day and night but at night, like anywhere else, you should keep your guard up and be aware of your surroundings.

During the day, in a very exclusive neighborhood a friend of mine was parked on her drive way taking her groceries out of the car, she put her hand-bag on top of the hood of the car, and a man came from nowhere and took it. This is a neighborhood where you don&#039;t see a soul in the streets. Yes, things can happen anywhere. For me what is important is to have the public transportation close, I don&#039;t like to have to drive to work, specially to Manhattan where parking is so expensive. What kind of transportation you take from 35th Ave. to Manhattan?

				Great pics, thanks for sharing! I especially enjoyed the then &amp; now effect.<br /><br />And I love 35th Avenue. It&#039;s part of the quiet zone and just 1 block to all the shops. Perfect!
