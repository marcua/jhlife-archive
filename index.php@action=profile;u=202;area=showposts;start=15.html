					Hi Everyone, <br /><br />A neighborhood friend asked me to pass this request on:&nbsp; &nbsp; Internationals Network is opening a school in San Francisco in Fall 2009, and the principal-designee is coming to NYC from August 20, 2008 through Thanksgiving 2008.&nbsp; Sonia Geerdes, the principal designee, will be interning at Flushing International High School this fall.&nbsp; The apt that the organization lined up for her just fell through.&nbsp; Sonia Geerdes is in need of a sublet or apt share in JH from August 20 through Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Sonia would live by herself there, but her husband is planning on coming out during her stay here at least once, maybe twice for a long weekend.The rent and apt expenses will be covered by the organization and clearly she is a serious professional, no pets, etc.&nbsp; Anyone who has an apt share or sublet available can contact Thomas Thomson at thomas.thomson@ internationalsne twork.org or 212-868-5180.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for any help you can provide. <br />Bryan <br /><br />

					<br />Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Great news!&nbsp; Jackson Heights was selected in the highly prized competitive program - the NYC Clean Streets program - to keep neighborhood streets clean.&nbsp; We were just notified that we were one of a few of the groups selected for the Clean Streets program.&nbsp; The Community Journal, a pending 501 (c) 3 non-profit, will administrate the program. <br /><br />The Western Jackson Heights Alliance was a lead partner in the application along with support from&nbsp; many local merchants and community-based-organizations including the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, New Immigrant Community Empowerment (NICE) and Chhaya Community Economic Development corporation, to name a few.&nbsp; The application was also strongly supported by Assemblyman Jose Peralta and Council Member Hiram Monserrate.<br /><br />The Clean Streets initiative will add two street cleaners for eight hours per day to the Jackson Heights gateway area of 73rd Street and 74th Street between Roosevelt Avenue and 37th Avenue five days a week, Thursday through Sunday beginning in November 2008.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of the sanitation services through the Clean Streets program will be supplemental to normal city sanitation services and any pre-existing supplemental services such as the Doe Fund services provided by Assemblyman Jose Peralta.<br /><br />To learn how to support the Clean Streets program in Jackson Heights contact the Community Journal at <a href="mailto:communityjournal@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">communityjournal@gmail.com</a> or call 718-393-7711.&nbsp; There will be an article on this new neighborhood initiative in the next edition of the Community Journal in June.<br /><br />Bryan Pu-Folkes<br />

					Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I am excited to announce the establishment of&nbsp; a new local organization in support of community development for Jackson Heights&nbsp; - the <strong>â€œ<span class="bbc_u">Community Journal</span>.â€ </strong> The organization also publishes a community paper with the same name every two months.<br /><br />Like the Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival that we recently started and is now in its second successful year, the Community Journal will support the small businesses in the neighborhood that make our community such a great place to live and work.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Community Journal will be offering a host of free services, including workshops and seminars, and what is probably of most interest to this audience, <strong>a membership program, named <strong>&quot;<em>Go JH!</em>&quot; </strong>, that will give members discounts to some of our favorite neighborhood businesses and institutions </strong> including Novo, Y Gallery, the EFN Zone gym, Letyâ€™s Bakery, the Makeup Salon, Rajbhog, Jardi, Chamunda Swami, Aaron at Isabellaâ€™s and the Queens Museum of Art.&nbsp; In short time, even more businesses will be added!&nbsp; Join <em><strong>Go JH!</strong></em> now for the <strong>special discounted introductory price of $20/year until March 1, 2008</strong>.&nbsp; Members will receive a non-transferrable photo identification card.<br /><br />The December 2007 paper edition is out now and being distributed in local banks, supermarkets, coffee shops and other commercial spaces in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The paper is currently sixteen pages (will grow) and features news, entertainment and other items of interest to the community.&nbsp; So as we continue to rally for our neighborhood letâ€™s add <strong><em>Go JH!</em></strong> to our roster.&nbsp; <br /><br />These are tangible ways to support the community, its residents and businesses â€“ and there are always ways for volunteers to contribute to such efforts. To join Go JH! or to find out how you can help, contact me at <a href="mailto:communityjournal@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">communityjournal@gmail.com</a> or 718-393-7711. <br /><br />Bryan Pu-Folkes<br />
