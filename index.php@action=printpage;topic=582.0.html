				I used to love Ming Wok at 85th and Northern but the last time I ordered it tasted very different.&nbsp; And there was a new person taking the order so I&#039;m wondering if they changed owners.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give it another try.

				We like ordering from J.J. Garden located within the Waldbaum&#039;s mall on 77th Street.&nbsp; We also enjoy eating in...particularly because Cannelle is just a few steps away!

				JJ&#039;s is actually really good. I do that too when I&#039;m at Waldbaums.&nbsp; forget&nbsp; about them.

				I wanted to post to bring this thread to the top of the list, as I was recently trying to figure out where to get takeout from.<br /><br />Do you know if JJ&#039;s delivers to the 90th/Northern area?<br /><br />Any other recommendations?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I don&#039;t know about Js deliveries since I usually pick up when I&#039;m shopping over there.&nbsp; It&#039;s so easy to park.&nbsp; Have you tried Ming Wok?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t gotten anything from them since the last time when I didn&#039;t love it.

				There are two chinese places on Northern and I can&#039;t keep their names straight.&nbsp; I think one is around 89th and the other is farther west (maybe around the low 80&#039;s/high 70&#039;s).<br />We&#039;ve ordered from both and really liked the one farther west.&nbsp; However, the past couple of times the food has not been as good.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s the place you&#039;re referring to because it sounds like a similar situation.<br />That said, we were looking to try something new.<br /><br />Has anyone tried Wok&#039;s?&nbsp; We have a menu from there, but couldn&#039;t find any reviews/info.

				My friend from China (and I mean speaks no English) only eats from Peking, but that could just be his regional preference.

				I ordered take-out from Peking tonight and my order arrived in 15 minutes!&nbsp; I think that&#039;s an all time record.&nbsp; &nbsp;:rockon:&nbsp; O.K., so it helps that I live close by and I ordered cold sesame noodles, but still...
