				Hi Gang,<br /><br />What restaurant would you recommend for a place for a 30-something lad like myself to take out a young woman of interest?<br /><br />I&#039;ve put Novo out there, but are there any other suggestions?<br /><br />It&#039;s just a casual 2nd date, so nothing too high-end would be great.<br /><br />-BS

				I&#039;m a big fan of La Flor in Woodside. Cozy, delicious, some higher-end items, but some very inexpensive things as well.&nbsp;

				I recommend La Fusta - it&#039;s an Argentinian place in Elmhurst not far from the 82nd St. station. &nbsp;Great sangria, nice wait staff, cozy interior. &nbsp;Since it&#039;s Argentinian and they have quite a bit of Italian influence in their cuisine, you can get pasta dishes in addition to the usual steaks. &nbsp;The food is quite nice. &nbsp;Search the board for some other posts on this place.<br /><br />For something a bit further away but still within reason, Sapori d&#039;Ischia in Woodside is also great - a step up from La Fusta and perfect for a date.&nbsp; Start with a proseco at the tiny bar.

				This thread may be of interest:<br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=228<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of Sapori d&#039;Ischia, but you should know what you&#039;re getting into.&nbsp; It&#039;s in an industrial area, and features live music (Broadway tunes, opera, Italian folk songs) several nights a week that can be a hoot but also can cut into conversation.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also agree with the recommendations of La Flor and La Fusta.<br /><br />Kabob Cafe in Astoria is a delicious and unique experience.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tiny place, and the gregarious owner/chef will take good care of you, both by providing you with yummy food, and by joining your dinner conversation!&nbsp; <br /><br />Back in Jackson Heights, on Northern Blvd., Natives is festive and has very attentive service, but can be noisy.<br />I have also heard good things about Uncle Peter&#039;s but haven&#039;t been there.

				Philoxenia in Astoria would be a good one. It&#039;s a cozy comfortable place -- with just enough energy and noise to make it fun but not enough noise to cut into conversation. Most importantly, the food is very good -- and the house wine ain&#039;t so bad either.

				La Cabana, Northern bet. 86/87.&nbsp; Steaks, pastas, personal size pizzas, seafood, etc.&nbsp; Good wine by the glass and beer.&nbsp; Brick walls, wood beam ceiling, they play music that isn&#039;t so loud so you can talk.&nbsp; Moderate to low prices.

				I second Buddy&#039;s recommendation of La Cabana.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice place to take a date.&nbsp; Charming ambiance, good steaks, pastas and love their pizza!

				Rest-Au-Rant in Astoria (corner of 30th street and 35th Ave I think).<br /><br />Beers, wine, paninis, cheese plates, salads. Nothing special in the food category, but great prices, super nice servers, cozy atmo, etc etc. Everything Jackson Heights needs. <br /><br /><br />

				I also like La Cabana.&nbsp; Does anyone know if it is the same owners as the place on 95th Street &amp; Roosevelt.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been at that location in years but I also loved that La Cabana.&nbsp; Both places have nice atmospheres and are very reasonable.
