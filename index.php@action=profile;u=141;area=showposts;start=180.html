And by the way, Maharaja also â€œspecialize(s) in sweetsâ€ because they have the exact same set-up as al-Naimat: sweets in the front, buffet and tables in the rear.

Kababish is take-away only, and I thought Delhi Palace is a full-service establishment, but I admit I have never been.

Their selection is limited, but their food is perfectly acceptable. (I&#8217;ve been thrice.) Maharaja is also a buffet, and on weekends I&#8217;m told so is Nanking (Indo-Chinese), but I guess I have only been on weekdays because I have never seen it despite my frequent visits. I have not eaten at Pakora since it was Khan Baba, and I was not impressed. For such a large place, the selection seems even tinier now as I peer through the window. I read online Kabab King had a self-serve buffet upstairs, and the upper level has been closed since I moved into the neighborhood, but just recently I saw the lights on upstairs so I&#8217;m keeping my fingers crossed.<br /><br />Ugh, now I&#8217;m hungry. <strong>Jeff</strong>, don&#8217;t forget me either. I&#8217;m frequently available afternoons, and these places often have different items lunchtime than dinnertime.

					Was this information from any kind of reliable source? So far as I am aware, TÃ¡i Son, Music Box and Chung Ki Wa do excellent business, and the Pronto Grocery just did a major rearrangement of their interior, including putting in a whole row of cigar humidors along one wall. And didnâ€™t CafÃ© Hot Roll also do some significant renovations recently? (I donâ€™t know about Broadway Wine, but the people who sit in front of their store in the middle of the night, near Pronto, seem pretty content.)

Noticing that groups of people are different does not at all constitute racism or sexism. This does not mean bigotry does not exist, and <em>no one</em> was criticized merely for broaching the topic of ethnic differences. That some members cannot distinguish between merely discussing ethnic differences and expressing bigotry seems very bipolar: unable to visualize shades of gray, unable to discern there is anything between <em>a</em> and <em>z</em>, alpha and omega. It also feels like a right wingâ€“dominated discussion when the concept of bigotry is presumed not to exist and the perception of it is dismissed out of hand with rolling eyes as â€œpolitically correct.â€ This is the Twenty-First Century, and hatred is frequently covert.

I am in no way the politically correct police, but I think it is very dangerous to speak in absolutes. When I read stuff like this:<br />&nbsp;(not to pick on you Birch-Ed)<br /><br />I read it as &quot;Immigrants from Germany, Ireland, South America, Korea, China, Japan, etc are clean&nbsp; and care about the neighborhood, and people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are dirty and disrespectful.&quot;<br /><br />If that&#039;s not what you&#039;re saying, maybe you need to think about the perception of your writing, because that&#039;s how I&#039;m (and from the responses, others) are reading it. What can come across as benign in conversation takes on a lot more weight on a message board because there is no subtlety. You have to rely solely on the words on the screen because there is no inflection, body language or other cues to see what a person might mean. I don&#039;t think that it is unreasonable for people to think about how their language effects others. Language is probably more powerful than we give it credit for, and by dismissing responsible language as &quot;political correctness&quot; I think you&#039;re entirely missing the point./hijack</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thank you, abee. I see I am not the only one who bristled at the statements made. In real life as well as online, it seems people are more concerned with countering insinuations of bigotry than countering bigotry. I absolutely concur there is a distinction, as Andrew put it, between race and culture, but the particular posts on which I commented did not observe that distinction. Many wish to leap to the postsâ€™ defense by essentially saying many good and accurate things (â€œDifferent people coming from different cultures DO act differently.&nbsp; That is NOT RACISM.â€) that donâ€™t really address the initial problem of the original words of the specific posts which likely reveal something about the authorâ€™s beliefs. That my gripe about the bigoted tone of certain posts created more of a negative reaction than the original posts themselves is really telling. Many people donâ€™t notice bigotry when they see it, and thus are baffled when someone complains about it, and then conclude the complainer must just be upset an issue was brought up at all rather than that it was being addressed in a bigoted way. In other words, the initial provocative comments are seen as benign, and the reaction to it is seen as an inflammatory defamation of character. (â€œI am not a racist but a nice guy, because I do all these nice things and I am a good person who has friends of every colorâ€ rather than discussing the original words that prompted the response.) The nonsense about â€œSo to be Politically Correct,, we can&#039;t mention the country of origin that a group of people which come to our neighborhood and dirty it.â€ is very dismissive and seems a smokescreen to draw attention away from the initial bigotry by insinuating any response to it is by the thought police.

					Not that this thread is really the place to discuss why I donâ€™t post here often, but it is because I occasionally feel uncomfortable and disrespected. It doesnâ€™t mean that any large number of members is expressing bigotry, merely that the continued and excused presence of bigots, however few there are, turns me off. I never said that <em>Jackson Heights Life</em> is the bigot board, just that I personally donâ€™t always feel comfortable, without making any extrapolations about how anyone else should feel. Putting a loud, brash Klansman in an intimate dinner party will make everyone feel uncomfortable and not want to participate, but it doesnâ€™t mean the majority of guests are racists. A small, vocal minority can make the majority feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />Also note the difference between the responses to Birch-Ed and the responses to me. The implication by John Prester that ethnicity should simply not be mentioned because, â€œBy doing so, you are falling into the trap of those wishing to find â€˜racismâ€™ hiding behind every lamp post in Jackson Heightsâ€ implies that I am seeking â€œracismâ€ (in quotation marks) that doesnâ€™t actually exist while Birch-Ed merely mentioned ethnicity which was nothing more than a faux pas that led him to fall into my trap. There is nothing wrong with race or ethnicity, so there is nothing wrong with mentioning it, just please recognize bigotry when you see it. And buddyâ€™s statement that I â€œdon&#039;t post here because you don&#039;t agree with someone&#039;s viewsâ€ is a bit of a trivialization; of course, there is no Web site where I agree with everyoneâ€™s views, but there is a world of difference between disagreement and bigotry. I enjoy and respect differences of opinion. Disagreement makes for some wonderful discussions, and I appreciate it. Making sweeping negative generalizations about ethnic groups based on litter on the street and witnessing a woman peeing in public is not mere disagreement.<br /><br />Maybe Iâ€™m just too sensitive, but Iâ€™m also surprised the handful of openly gay members have said nothing about the confusion in another thread between the prostitution problem on Roosevelt Avenue and the mere presence of transsexuals on the avenue. Again, the majority of members have been very respectful, but a member or two need to be told the problem is with prostitution, not with transsexuals.

					(This is why I donâ€™t post on <em>Jackson Heights Life</em> much.) Kabab King and the street vendors at 73rd Street and 37th Road certainly do need to contribute to the fight against litter, but there are also a number of (Western-looking) individuals who sleep on the sidewalk near the same intersection sprawled out in such a way that pedestrians can barely pass. I moved into Jackson Heights only earlier this year and have witnessed them on more than one occasion. As opposed to the peeing South Asian woman who was witnessed (if the story is to be believed) precisely once. Beyond this one alleged incident, we have no idea who she is, what goes on in her life, what was going on that one day that prompted her to take such a drastic measure that may have greatly embarrassed her, etc. In all the other cultures listed in Birch-Edâ€™s post, the number of individuals who <em>are not</em> witnessed peeing in public (i.e., 100%) become indicative of their cultures (â€œâ€¦I can tell you that no woman from Germany, Ireland, Korean [sic], Japan or any Spanish country has lifted up her dress and urinated by a treeâ€, as if he could possibly know such a thing), whereas this one poor Desi woman in this one isolated incident must serve to represent not only her culture but a whole cluster of related cultures. I also donâ€™t appreciate words being placed in my mouth with statements being made (â€œSo let&#039;s stop beating around the bush and pinpoint the culprits who dirty our street.â€) as if we <em>all</em> think the South Asian cultures themselves are to blame but we are too polite to say so. Members (whatever their ethnic background) who use such obvious hate speech really need to be removed from the board.

Could you be more specific about its location? Which corner is the funny one? The intersection indicated is a wide-open plaza with Jackson Heights on one side and Elmhurst on the other. The northwest side of the triangle is where Eagle Plaza is, the northeast side is where the Bengali movie and music store is, and the south side is the Elmhurst side of Roosevelt Avenue. I am a gay night owl desperately seeking more all-night restaurants and who has walked all around the area collecting take-away menus for my growing collection, and although Iâ€™m quite new to the area, I am surprised I missed the place.
