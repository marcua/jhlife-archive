I walked over to Dime Savings bank on 37th ave and asked them if they belong to a big bank. I was given the history of the bank, which is posted on one of their walls as well. A quick Google search gave me more info on the bank. Their fees are comparable to those of big banks. What I like is the fact that they are very conservative when it comes to lending money. Anyways...food for thought here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icqrx0OimSs&amp;feature=player_embedded" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icqrx0OimSs&amp;feature=player_embedded</a><br /><br />On top of that, I started paying in cash so that Visa/MasterCard don&#039;t charge local businesses for providing the &quot;convenience&quot; of using a credit card reader.<br /><br />Later!

					I went to Ruby Rosa for the first time with sister and boyfriend. Got there sometime after 8pm on Saturday. The place was totally empty so we got to sit wherever we wanted. The place is small enough to be cozy. I had been to Mystic before and I liked the decoration a lot better. But I was willing to give this place&nbsp; a chance (Full disclosure here: I went in because of the 7-10pm happy hour...2x1 Mojitos). <br /><br /><strong>The staff</strong> was very attentive (of course, there was no one else there). Within a few minutes, a couple of girls walked in and sat at another table. The service remained the same. Although the music was too loud for my taste it wasn&#039;t so bad that we couldn&#039;t hold a conversation. Before I knew it, almost all the tables were occupied. This place was full of single girls and all I could think was...do guys know this place exist? The music started getting louder at which point I asked the waitress what was going on. She told me that after 9 or so, people can get up and dance. She told me that a lot more good looking girls usually show up later at night. At which point I had to tell her I wasn&#039;t into girls and that I was very much into my boyfriend (note to self: don&#039;t let Mojitos do the talking for you.) She deadpanned with &quot;lots of hot guys show up even later tonight&quot;. We cracked up and that&#039;s basically when I allowed the Mojitos to take over and boy oh boy did we dance the night out!<br /><br />I ended up dancing with most of the single girls at that place. These girls know how to have fun! By the way...easy on the Mojitos because they are STRONG!<br /><br /><strong>The Food.</strong> I like the fact that this place only has a one page menu. My kind of place. I&#039;m very weary of places where the menu looks more like a book. This place serves food from Puerto Rico/Dominican Republic, Colombia and Ecuador. I had Chicken Mofongo (I have had this at Dominican restaurants and are to die for when prepared well.) Needlessly to say, I didn&#039;t die. The platanos were too dry. Tasty though. But dry. And the chicken was more like nuggets of chicken rather than a chicken stew smeared on top of the platanos. But I ate it because it was still good. My sister asked for grilled chicken with rice and beans. She&#039;s boring when it comes to eating. Grilled chicken?!! C&#039;on! My boyfriend went with what the waitress suggested: fried fillet of fish topped with &quot;salsita&quot; accompanied with rice and beans (ecuadorian style). THIS WAS TO DIE FOR!!! The fish was crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. It had this nice garlic, cumin and black pepper after taste. And when you eat it with the citrus in the &#039;salsita&#039; OMFG! I know what to order next time.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /><br /><br />What I like most about this place is how welcoming the staff was. Now, this might not mean a lot to some people, but as a gay guy who is out to have dinner with his sister and boyfriend, ending up at a place where people only look at the color of your bills, well, that means a lot to me.<br /><br /><strong>In a scale of 1 to 10:</strong><br />Food: 5 (it can go to a 10 if all I eat is fried fish fillet)<br />Drinks: 8 (Pros: good price and 2x1. Cons: too strong...too much alcohol)<br />Music: 7 (too loud at the beginning but when dancing, the sound was just perfect)<br />Service: 9 (my waitress -from Ecuador- was just too nice and friendly)<br />Fun Factor: 9&nbsp; :rockon:<br />

					Why is it that we don&#039;t seem to get so upset when we allow corporations paste their ugly advertisements on subway walls and on billboards but we do get upset when we have regular Joes write on a street lampposts? Why is it not considered vandalism when a street lamppost has a &quot;sponsored by&quot; or &quot;presented by&quot; but it&#039;s infuriating when someone posts an &#039;apt for rent&#039; or &#039;for a good time call...&#039;? Is it because those people are not paying to advertise? or is it because we are so full of it we think that just because we find something upsetting the masses have to find it upsetting too. <br /><br />If you ask me, Times Square is full of &quot;expensive&quot; graffiti â€“the one paid for by corporations. Perhaps if the person who is writing those notes adds some tacky neon lights around his/her posts and ends them with &quot;sponsored by Walt Disney&quot; we will all be able to call Jackson Heights middle class? or &quot;better&quot; yet, an upscale neighborhood?&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/rolleyes.gif" alt="&#58;&#58;&#41;" title="Roll Eyes" class="smiley" />

					Extremely good points 80streetobserver! I&#039;m glad to read that the majority of the people participating on this thread seem to understand the underlying problem with crime...and the notion that cameras won&#039;t solve a thing. <br /><br />The &quot;crime and quality of life issues&quot; in JH&nbsp; of the 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s was due to the very profitable &quot;war on drugs&quot; the government kicked off in the 70&#039;s. Oh, and the consequences of that &#039;war&#039; didn&#039;t just affect JH or &quot;the ghetto&quot;. Remember Studio 54? This drug war cost taxpayers more money which left little money for after school programs, recreational facilities, education and job creation. You know....&#039;small&#039; resources that keeps the citizens of a society busy in more constructive behavior. Take a look at this 6 part documentary about the American Drug War and then let&#039;s discuss life in JH in the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55kvq_american-drug-war-part-1_people" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55kvq_american-drug-war-part-1_people</a><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55lex_american-drug-war-part-2_people" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55lex_american-drug-war-part-2_people</a><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55lq8_american-drug-war-part-3_people" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55lq8_american-drug-war-part-3_people</a><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55m1a_american-drug-war-part-4_people" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55m1a_american-drug-war-part-4_people</a><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55mf3_american-drug-war-part-5_people" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55mf3_american-drug-war-part-5_people</a><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55ms8_american-drug-war-part-6_people" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55ms8_american-drug-war-part-6_people</a><br /><br />What helped the turning around of JH -and other areas- was the new economic stimulus of the early 90&#039;s, not an increase in the number of police officers. There was also the beginning of the dot.com boom. New jobs were generated in new industries. People were moving up the economic ladder, etc, etc, etc. The rich got richer, the middle class got richer, the poor moved up a lil&#039; bit.<br /><br />Giving the police more tools to keep an eye on us doesn&#039;t make for a safer society. It only makes a society a police state. <br /><br />You really want things to change? Then vote for politicians who will do the hard and dirty work. Vote for politicians who will make sure that our tax money is well spent in programs that will allow at least one parent in a household to stay home taking care of their children. And if the household only has one parent, then make sure there are programs to help that parent. Vote for politicians who will go after inflation, poor education and who will fight for salary increases. Vote for politicians who would rather spend out tax money on programs for the people instead of giving subsidies to big corporations. Vote for politicians who will create true Universal Healthcare so that people don&#039;t go broke paying for medical bills.&nbsp; And if that politician doesn&#039;t exist. Then run for office and become that politician.<br /><br />Applying band-aids to a problem is easy. Getting rid of the problem by attacking its roots...now that&#039;s something not many people are willing to do.<br /><br />Peace!

					I&#039;m from the coast of Ecuador (Guayaquil). The food is slightly different than that from Quito. I have to admit that there&#039;s this restaurant in JH, I think the name is &quot;Barzola&quot;, it&#039;s on 37th avenue between 92 &amp; 93 streets, BEST food from the coast of Ecuador! <br /><br />Their &quot;caldo de bolas&quot; is great. <br /><br />If you ask for &quot;ceviche de camarones&quot; please make sure you squeeze some lemon in it and eat with a side order of steaming white rice and some plantain chips but make sure the rice is steaming hot. Take some of that rice in your spoon, deep it in the ceviche, put it in your mouth and just as your taste glands have taken in all the flavors, eat some plantain chips. Repeat. The more lemon juice, the better. Homemade hot sauce is optional. We call it &quot;aji&quot; which is like &quot;pico de gallo&quot; but only spicier.<br /><br />&quot;TallarÃ­n saltado&quot; is good too. <br /><br />Oh, and they also have &quot;chaulafÃ¡n&quot; which is the Ecuadorian version of Chinese House Special fried rice. <br /><br />Their &quot;fritada&quot; is so so. Too dry for my taste. <br /><br />BE WARNED though...the service is HORRIBLE and the food takes forever to arrive. Perhaps the reason it tastes like mom&#039;s homemade stuff? Dunno.<br /><br />I have tried the other two places mentioned here and I must say, I was never happy with them. But what do I know about food from Quito? ;-)

					As far as I know, a restaurant&#039;s <strong>sidewalk cafÃ© permit</strong> approval (or denial) has a lot to do with our Community Board and it&#039;s not always just up to the restaurant/cafÃ© owner. On top of that, the red tape involved in acquiring a permit used to be very painful (and expensive). The City of NY simplified the process in &#039;03 and the # of permit applications and approvals have increased. I don&#039;t know if our CB has changed though. Some of us might have to run for office if we want to see more changes.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/rolleyes.gif" alt="&#58;&#58;&#41;" title="Roll Eyes" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Just to let you know, we old timers have asked restaurants for outdoor dining for awhile. I hope Novo has a permit...I enjoy their mojitos...<strong>only</strong> their mojitos.<br /><br />
