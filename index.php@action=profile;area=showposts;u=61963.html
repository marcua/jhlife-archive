					New York Mart has been closed for well over a week.&nbsp; I needed some Asian cooking ingredients last weekend and ended up going to H Mart on Woodside at 58th.&nbsp; They only let a few people into the store at a time so it was safe. <br /><br />Most of the other Asian supermarkets we frequent -- in Elmhurst and Flushing -- have been closed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was encouraged to see Patel Brother&#039;s reopen.&nbsp; Also saw activity today at Lemon Farms, so I am hopeful for a reopening soon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stay safe and good luck with your Asian shopping.&nbsp;

					From Wall Street Journal, April 4<br /><br /><br />New York City Sees More Burglaries of Businesses Under Coronavirus Emergency Measures<br />Some shops are opting to board up storefronts as a deterrent<br />Sephora has boarded up its stores in Times Square, above, and on West 34th Street.<br />Photo: Kholood Eid for The Wall Street Journal<br />By Ben Chapman and<br />Keiko Morris<br />April 4, 2020 10:00 am ET<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Burglaries of businesses have risen in New York City under emergency measures to fight the new coronavirus, according to new New York Police Department data, and some businesses are boarding up their storefronts.<br /><br />The NYPD has seen a 75% increase in reports of burglaries of commercial establishments from March 12, when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency, to March 31, police officials said. The NYPD recorded 254 burglaries of businesses during that time period this year compared with 145 for the same period last year, the officials said.<br /><br />All boroughs of the city have seen increases, the officials said.<br /><br />The increase in burglaries coincided with steps to stop the spread of the coronavirus. On March 15, the city ordered restaurants and bars to cease on-site service, prompting many establishments to close altogether or limit operations. A March 20 decree by Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for the closure of all nonessential businesses, leading many retail stores to shutter.<br /><br />“We knew with the closing of many stores that we could see an increase and, unfortunately, we are,” said NYPD Chief of Crime Control Strategies Michael LiPetri.<br /><br />The increase in commercial burglaries comes as major crimes across the city fell during the pandemic. From March 12 through March 31, major felonies, such as rapes, murders and assaults, fell by nearly 20% when compared with the same period in 2019, dropping to 3,740 such crimes from 4,670 a year earlier.<br /><br />But Mr. LiPetri said that break-ins of eateries, supermarkets and retail establishments are fueling a rise in commercial burglaries. There were 30 burglaries of supermarkets and bodegas between March 12 and March 31, according to NYPD data, a 400% increase from six such incidents recorded during the same period a year earlier. Burglaries of eateries nearly doubled, rising to 51 incidents in 2020 from 28 incidents in 2019.<br /><br />Thieves are taking currency, electronics and consumables, such as food, alcohol and retail goods from businesses, Mr. LiPetri said. They gain entry to closed businesses by forcing open doors, breaking windows or climbing in from rooftops, he said.<br /><br />NYPD patrols are mobilized against the thefts, Mr. LePetri said. Police are working with business owners to deploy additional resources where needed and are reassessing patrols in real time, according to NYPD officials. On March 31, police apprehended three suspects charged in a string of burglaries in Queens and Brooklyn.<br /><br />As burglaries have increased, a handful of chain retailers have boarded up New York City shops, including the cosmetics retailer Sephora, which has covered the windows of stores at locations in Times Square and on West 34th Street in Manhattan<br /><br />In a statement, Sephora representatives said the company has closed North American locations to adapt to the coronavirus and adopted standardized precautions for its properties. “Our goal is to ensure a great experience for our clients when we have the opportunity to reopen,” the company said.<br /><br />Police officials said that few New York City businesses have boarded up their storefronts. But leaders of local business-improvement districts worry that the strategy could invite graffiti and potentially prompt other shop owners to do the same. Some districts said they haven’t seen any large increases or break-ins of storefronts.<br /><br />Dan Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership, a business-improvement district that includes the closed Sephora location, said it isn’t necessary for businesses to board up their windows. “It’s a solution in search of a problem,” Mr. Biederman said.<br /><br />On Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, the local business-improvement district already had to send crews to remove graffiti from the boards covering an Aesop store, said Mark Caserta, executive director of the Park Slope Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District.<br /><br />Residents who noticed vandalism of the storefront run by the high-end retailer of lotions, fragrances and skin-care products called to complain, Mr. Caserta said. Representatives for Aesop didn’t respond to calls for comment.<br /><br />Mr. Caserta said boarding up buildings sends an inappropriate message to the community.<br /><br />“It brings up this idea of rioting and collapse of society,” Mr. Caserta said. “This is way too much, and it sends the wrong signal.”.

					Hi, passthekimchi,&nbsp; I have used Citizen for quite a while, and I have a police scanner.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t noticed an increase in crime since our staycation began last month, but I am wary of robberies and burglaries since so many people are out of work. <br /><br />The 3 a.m. buzzing of Jackson Heights by an low-altitude NYPD chopper was apparently triggered by a rooftop manhunt for burglars.&nbsp; One poster in that helicopter thread on Citizen said Farine had been burglarized recently and was out $6,000.&nbsp; Another poster talked about police on the rooftop at 37th and 90th. <br /><br />On the positive side, the menacing lookouts that patrol Roosevelt at 78 and 79 are gone.&nbsp; The massage parlor management must have gotten the message about social distancing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

The caps will go into place in 2024 and tighten in 2030 and 2040, with a goal of slashing the city&#039;s emissions to three-fifths of 2005 levels at the end of the next decade and to one-fifth that amount by midcentury.<br /><br />The measure exempts or sets more lenient limits for houses of worship, single-family homes, hospitals, certain low- and middle- income cooperatives, New York City Housing Authority complexes, public edifices and power plants. To the chagrin of major real estate interests, that means the weight of the law falls mainly upon commercial buildings and market-rate condominiums and co-ops.<br /><br />&quot;This will be the largest disruption in the history of New York City real estate,&quot; said John Mandyck, the chief executive officer of the Urban Green Council. &quot;Buildings will have to do deep energy retrofits or buy green power or eventually look at carbon trading. We get that it&#039;s tough and that billions of dollars will need to be spent to reduce carbon emissions. But new technology and new business models will be invented to help buildings get there.&quot;<br /><br />The Urban Green Council had convened in recent years a working group to help craft emissions regulations, but its recommendations were changed by the City Council, infuriating the Real Estate Board of New York, which had participated in the group.<br /><br />&quot;Unfortunately, [the legislation] does not take a comprehensive, citywide approach needed to solve this complex issue,&quot; REBNY President John Banks said in a statement. &quot;A coalition of stakeholders including environmental organizations, labor, engineering professionals, housing advocates and real estate owners came together and proposed comprehensive and balanced reforms that would have achieved these goals.&quot;<br />ADVERTISING<br />Last year&#039;s model<br /><br />In 2010 the Durst Organization&#039;s then-new 1 Bryant Park—also called the Bank of America Tower—became the first skyscraper to win the top status of &quot;platinum&quot; from the U.S. Green Building Council&#039;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program. Its eco-friendly features include floor-to- ceiling double-paned windows that trap heat from the sun, a rainwater capture system that supplies the cooling towers and toilets, and an on-site cogeneration plant that burns natural gas to produce two-thirds of the building&#039;s electricity and its heat.<br /><br />But according to the company&#039;s calculations, the Climate Mobilization Act will saddle the tower with $2.5 million in fines in 2024. And that will just be the beginning.<br /><br />&quot;The fine will escalate annually from there,&quot; lamented Alexander Durst, chief development officer at the family-run firm.<br /><br />The problem, Durst said, is that 1 Bryant Park is open 24 hours a day and hosts 11,000 workers—and the company and other real estate interests say the legislation penalizes density and intensity of use. That is because it targets only large buildings and uses formulas based on building class and square footage to determine how much carbon a structure may emit and how much electricity it may pull from the grid. This would appear to contradict past city and state policies that favored concentrated, centralized commercial and residential development.<br /><br />The Dursts aren&#039;t the only ones worried that their past investments in energy efficiency won&#039;t spare them from fines. Ed Ermler, president of the Roosevelt Terrace co-op complex in Jackson Heights, Queens, spent much of the past decade persuading his shareholders to invest in a natural gas cogeneration plant, light-emitting diode fixtures and cutting- edge temperature control and regulation technology.<br /><br />He does not believe he can suppress his building&#039;s carbon emissions much more, and said they will exceed the bill&#039;s limits. That will force his co-op—home to many elderly residents—either to pay fines or buy greenhouse-gas offsets by giving money to approved environmental projects.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re already at a minimal baseline to begin with,&quot; Ermler said. &quot;At the end of the day, I&#039;m going to have my seniors—who are hard-pressed to pay their maintenance on a good day—getting hit with assessments. And I&#039;m going to end up with a lot of co-ops I can&#039;t sell.&quot;<br /><br />REBNY similarly lamented the potential consequences of the legislation. Banks, the industry group&#039;s president, said it recognized the challenge of climate change, but the bill&#039;s exemptions will make it impossible to cut the city&#039;s overall emissions as drastically as hoped. The bill&#039;s goal is for large buildings to reduce emissions 40% by 2030.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Banks warned, the city will be less attractive to growing sectors of the economy that expect long hours and compact workspaces.<br /><br />The bill &quot;will fall short of achieving the 40-by-30 goal by only including half the city&#039;s building stock,&quot; he said. &quot;The approach taken today will have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain a broad range of industries, including technology, media, finance and life sciences.&quot;<br /><br />There were critics on the City Council too. One Republican said it would raise the cost of housing.<br /><br />&quot;We live in the most expensive city, with the most expensive housing market in the U.S.,&quot; said Staten Island&#039;s Joseph Borelli, a candidate for public advocate. &quot;Why that is not priority No. 1—alleviating the cost to develop structures and lower the market rate of apartments—is beyond me.&quot;<br /><br />Buildings with rent-regulated units were exempted.<br />Buck Ennis<br /><br />Fine time: One Bryant Park, center, despite numerous energy-efficiency measures, would pay escalating annual penalties starting at $2.5 million in 2024 if it doesn’t reduce its carbon footprint, its owners say.<br />Planning for the planet<br /><br />Queens Councilman Costa Constantinides, who heads the Committee on Environmental Protection and sponsored the emissions-cap legislation, dismissed many of those concerns. He noted that only 20% of buildings in each category will have to alter their physical structure or their consumption patterns by 2024, and he highlighted studies showing buildings of 25,000 feet or more account for 2% of all structures in the city but produce 30% of its carbon emissions.<br /><br />His office pointed to sections of the legislation that place lighter restrictions on electricity consumption for buildings with cogeneration plants, and allow for dispensations or reduced penalties for buildings with long hours and high utilization of space, or engaged in energy-intensive industries. Other bills in the Climate Mobilization Act create instruments for financing building retrofits and on-site renewable energy infrastructure, and allow property owners to surpass emissions caps by purchasing green power.<br /><br />&quot;New York City deserves bold, meaningful climate legislation to reduce our carbon emissions while acknowledging the daily real-world challenges many New Yorkers face,&quot; Constantinides said. &quot;After engaging with the varied communities, industries and interests impacted by this bill, I believe we have that sound legislation.&quot;<br /><br />Several sources pointed out to Crain&#039;s that the Champlain Hudson Power Express, a transmission cable bringing renewable hydroelectric power from Canada, will come on line in 2021—supplying energy that will not count toward emissions caps.<br /><br />&quot;In recognition that some buildings just use more energy, [there is] an alternative compliance path,&quot; said Jeffrey Perlman, the founder and president of Bright Power, a firm that does building energy audits and green retrofitting. &quot;Buildings that are 40% over their target need only reduce carbon emissions by 30% over 2018 levels. Additionally, buildings can purchase carbon offsets for 10% of their emissions and renewable energy to offset emissions from electricity.&quot;<br /><br />Council Speaker Corey Johnson waved off the real estate industry&#039;s complaints more succinctly, calling attention to the scientific consensus that society has about 12 years to ward off the most serious impacts of climate change. No dollar amount, he suggested, could equal the human cost of environmental devastation.<br /><br />&quot;That is a sad argument. If that&#039;s the best they have, then this is not a fair fight,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;You can&#039;t put a price tag on life on Earth.&quot; <br />

					Too many homicides in the 115th Precinct in the last year.<br /><br />I attended a community NYPD meeting in the basement room of an apartment building on Northern Boulevard.&nbsp; The format was ZERO input from attendees.&nbsp; Not even an open mic for anyone to comment. <br /><br />The woman hosting the meeting was into the pledge of allegiance, prayers and cheer-leading for the police, including letter reading by kids praising cops.&nbsp; A member of the clergy spoke about Black History Month.&nbsp; No one talked about the gang violence.&nbsp; <br /><br />The 115th sent no fewer than six NYPD staffers to the meeting.&nbsp; But the meeting lacked any kind of request for community input.&nbsp; There should have been some comments about the steady increase in corpses:<br /><br />Bodega killing on Roosevelt (gang-related)&nbsp; <a href="https://jacksonheightspost.com/man-fatally-shot-jackson-heights-bodega" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://jacksonheightspost.com/man-fatally-shot-jackson-heights-bodega</a><br /><br />Subway platform killing at 82/Roosevelt (gang-related)&nbsp; <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/jackson-heights-elmhurst/jackson-heights-subway-fight-ends-fatal-shooting-police-say" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://patch.com/new-york/jackson-heights-elmhurst/jackson-heights-subway-fight-ends-fatal-shooting-police-say</a><br /><br />Bound-up dead guy on 79th near Roosevelt (no info from cops)&nbsp; <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/10/man-found-dead-bound-in-queens-apartment/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nypost.com/2019/02/10/man-found-dead-bound-in-queens-apartment/</a><br /><br />Shooting death 37th and 88th (this week) <br /><br />Shooting on 37th near 90th (gang-related, according to cops who spoke with my wife while canvassing for video) <a href="https://jacksonheightspost.com/man-fatally-shot-jackson-heights-bodega" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://jacksonheightspost.com/man-fatally-shot-jackson-heights-bodega</a><br /><br />The NYPD lieutenant to whom I spoke at the community meeting told me the extra staffing in the precinct was handling the problem with visibility and force, especially along Rooseelt. <br /><br />I disagree.&nbsp; The vice unit isn&#039;t stopping the prostitution along Roosevelt from 76 to 80.&nbsp; The menacing lookouts are still on the corners watching for trouble.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thugs wearing full face masks to avoid video and facial recognition software are allowed to roam unchecked.&nbsp; <br /><br />This neighborhood has so much potential that is being wasted because of lax enforcement.&nbsp; My suggestion to NYPD is to add foot patrols who actually get to know the neighborhood merchants and residents.&nbsp; Not the so-called &quot;directed patrols&quot; that merely send uniformed officers to Diversity Plaza or the 74th/Roosevelt MTA stop to stand around looking at their iPhones, or sit in their patrol cars.&nbsp; That isn&#039;t policing. <br /><br /><br /><br />

					Went inside this bakery Saturday and saw Balthazar bread for sale.&nbsp; There were lots of empty bread racks, so I&#039;ll be curious if they will be selling their own bread. Specialty croissants (I cant remember if they were almond or chocolate) were $3.50 each.&nbsp; Muffins were $2.50.&nbsp; It was crowded.&nbsp; Off to a good start.
