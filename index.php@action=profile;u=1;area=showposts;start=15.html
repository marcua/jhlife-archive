The primary mission of forums like these is not to &quot;uphold the values of free speech&quot;, but to facilitate dialog about X topic; this automatically implies limits on the speech.<br /><br />The argument that a top-down approach to speech moderation in a forum like this stifles dialog and has a negative impact on the community I think is a valid position, but it&#039;s an equally valid position that entirely free conversation would have the same negative impact. The moderators are looking for a balance, and openly recognize the problems inherent with moderating. It&#039;s not easy running a site like this.

					Yeah, now just have to get the domain to propagate somehow. I still don&#039;t have an ETA from the domain registrar as to when that will happen.<br /><br />Good idea by the way on the link at the top of the forum! I had just figured out the temporary url for the new server so ti was very timely.

Post your content once, to the correct category, people will see it and will be more likely to appreciate and respond to your post.</li><li><strong>Keep threads on-topic</strong>: If your conversation appears to be veering off-topic, please start a new thread.&nbsp; You can always post a link to it in the old thread so people can find where it continues.</li><li><strong>Respect others&#039; privacy</strong>: Because of privacy issues, it is against the rules of the board to post anyone&#039;s full name, address, or any other personal information (e.g. email address, phone number, etc.) without permission.&nbsp; The only exceptions to this are for individuals are already public figures (e.g. celebrities, elected officials), or who openly use their names on the internet (e.g. a blogger who writes under her/his own name).</li><li><strong>Do not quote personal messages publicly</strong>: Unless specifically requested by the author.</li><li><strong>Do not gossip about private individuals</strong>.&nbsp; Avoid discussing or speculating about the behavior or motivations of people&#039;s private lives.&nbsp; An individual mentioned in the news media, or who posts something of interest online, may be discussed in that context, but her/his private life beyond these topics should not.</li><li><strong>One account per person</strong>.&nbsp; You may only create one account here. If you don&#039;t like your account and want to create a new one, contact a moderator first so you won&#039;t be penalized.</li><li><strong>Contact a moderator or admin</strong>: If you are having an ongoing problem, or feel you are being harassed by another member you can contact one of the moderators directly. We are always here to help in any way we can.</li></ul><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Other Information and Guidelines</strong></span><br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li><strong>Don&#039;t make it personal</strong>: If you have a problem with something someone has said, ask for clarification, or send them a private message. If you feel the need to respond publicly don&#039;t make it personal (like &quot;hey you jerk, I&#039;m offended&quot;). Instead engage the person&#039;s idea and express your disagreement with it in a respectful way (I disagree with what you&#039;ve said here and this is why...). </li><li><strong>Don&#039;t rush to judgment</strong>:&nbsp; Please keep in mind that things don&#039;t always come across in writing the same as they sound in their author&#039;s head.&nbsp; This is a common problem on the Internet, where people don&#039;t always carefully compose what they write, and readers can&#039;t benefit from the visual and aural cues that help listeners understand a speaker&#039;s real meaning when they talk face to face.&nbsp; So before taking offense at something you read here, please consider whether there&#039;s an alternative way to interpret the author&#039;s intent.</li><li><strong>Use the &quot;report to moderator&quot; feature</strong>: If you find something offensive, or if someone is misbehaving or not following the board guidelines please assist the moderators by reporting that post. A message is generated that goes to the moderation queue and moderators will respond as soon as possible.</li><li><strong>This is an open forum</strong>:&nbsp; The owners or administrators of this board cannot and do not read every post, and cannot back up or investigate all the information that is posted here. Please understand that any posts that you read here do not necessarily represent the ideas of the owners or administrators of this board. </li><li><strong>Protect your privacy</strong>.&nbsp; This website is accessible to all, so we recommend limiting the amount of personal information you post here.&nbsp; You can &quot;hide&quot; your email address from others seeing it.&nbsp; But don&#039;t be alarmed that the software will still show you <em>your own email address</em>. Don&#039;t worry, if the hide email setting is turned on, nobody else can see your address.</li><li><strong>DON&#039;T SHOUT!</strong>&nbsp; Try not to emphasize your point using all capital letters.&nbsp; Many readers consider it jarring, sort of like shouting in a library.</li><li><strong>Keep signatures simple</strong>: You may create a personal &quot;signature&quot; to use in all your postings. However, signatures are limited to text only.&nbsp; No banners or other graphics allowed.&nbsp; Links to internet businesses without a connection to this community may result in your account being marked as a spam account and deleted.</li><li><strong>You&#039;re not completely anonymous</strong>: Our software tracks your IP address, and keeps a log of your actions on this board (though this software doesn&#039;t go beyond the scope of any other forum software out there). If a formal legal complaint is filed as a result of some action you&#039;ve taken on this board we reserve the right to share this information with legal council or authorities.</li><li><strong>Don&#039;t abuse the cover of anonymity</strong> to advance commercial/professional interests in a deceptive manner (e.g. posing as a customer of your restaurant, or posing as a concerned citizen if you&#039;re a political professional).&nbsp; We reserve the right to disclose relevant information about this type of abuse to the community.</li><li><strong>You&#039;re responsible for your posts</strong>: If you give out your password and someone else logs into your account, you are still responsible for what is posted. Don&#039;t give out your password.</li><li><strong>Cookies</strong>: This software places a cookie on your computer that is used to store your username/password (if you have that feature enabled), and is also used for some of the more advanced features of the site. If you prefer to not have those features enabled you can simply block our cookie. </li><li><strong>Deleting posts</strong>: Once you have created an account and/or posted here, you will not be able to delete those posts or your account. Contact a moderator if you have questions or need assistance.</li><li><strong>Classified boards (Apartments, Sublets &amp; Roommates; Community Trade and Classifieds; and Business Listings and Services Directory)</strong>: These sections are for posting classified and local business listings and are not discussion forums.&nbsp; &nbsp;Simple questions can be asked in the Classified boards, but please limit commentary and discussion to the appropriate board under &quot;Get Connected.&quot;<br /><br /><br /></li></ul><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></span><br /><br />By registering here you agree that:<br /><br />(1) You will not post any abusive, vulgar, or offensive information on this forum;<br /><br />(2) You will respect the privacy of others, and not reveal the identity of, or post the private contact information of, or otherwise harass others in a way that invades their right to remain anonymous;<br /><br />(3) You will abide by applicable U.S. and International law as it relates to any of your posts this forum; and <br /><br />(4) You are soley responsible for the content you post and recognize that your views (and the views of others) do not necessarily represent the views of the board owners, administrators or moderators.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Please provide feedback about these guidelines.
