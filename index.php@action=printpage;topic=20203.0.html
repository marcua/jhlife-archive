				https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/realestate/co-op-wars-do-you-dare-walk-on-the-grass.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Co-op Wars: Do You Dare Walk on the Grass?<br />By Michelle Higgins<br />May 20, 2016<br /><br />In Jackson Heights, Queens, a revolution in the world of co-ops has been won.<br /><br />At the end of a pitched battle that lasted nearly a decade, residents of the Hawthorne Court, a 14-building apartment complex with an expansive landscaped backyard, can now walk on the grass.<br /><br />The 140-unit co-op was one of the last holdouts among a distinctive group of residences in this historic district of north-central Queens to lift its grass-walking ban. While the controversy was ostensibly about landscaping, it illustrates how changing demographics can create rifts in co-ops where a new generation of buyers with different values challenges longstanding conventions. Elsewhere the tension may be defined by a push to hire a doorman or build a gym or a children’s playroom, but in Jackson Heights, the focus has been on the classic open spaces of these co-ops, known as “garden apartments.”<br /><br />These apartment buildings were designed starting in the early 20th century by the Queensboro Corporation, with buildings that surround blocklong interior green spaces. (Many will be opened to the public on June 11 as part of a historic weekend.)<br /><br />For years, many of the co-ops mandated that the backyard be reserved for quiet contemplation. Reading a book or strolling the grounds was allowed so long as residents kept off the grass and stuck to designated walkways and benches. The lawn was not to be disturbed.<br /><br />But over the last decade, a new wave of buyers moved into Jackson Heights, often paying significantly more than those who came before them, and bringing different ideas about how the gardens should be used. In one camp were the longtime residents who wished to preserve the tranquil nature of the gardens. In the other were the newcomers, primarily families with young children, who wanted to roll out picnic blankets and let their children run on the grass. Heated discussions of whether the latter should be permitted transpired, and rules were eventually loosened.<br /><br />Nowhere was the feud more intense than at the Hawthorne Court on 76th and 77th Streets between 35th and 37th Avenues where co-op board meetings were called, factions formed and a culture clash erupted.<br /><br />“This became a real inflammatory issue,” said Mike Lieber, 70, a film producer and former cultural anthropologist who arrived at the Hawthorne Court in 2000 and remains neutral on the grass debate. “From my point of view, it all seemed a lot of silliness and should have been gotten out of the way with much less effort. But that’s not human nature.”<br /><br />It all began in the spring of 2007 when a group of new arrivals made a concerted push to loosen the rules in the garden, a lush swath of greenery with pathways, landscaping and a circle with benches at its center. A proposal to lift the grass-walking ban was taken to the Hawthorne Court Council, a body of representatives from each of the 14 buildings that surround the garden, for a vote.<br /><br />Arguments against opening up the lawn ranged from liability concerns to declarations that the grass was too delicate to withstand people. “That was probably a red herring from the beginning,” said Debby Silverfine, 63, the secretary of the Hawthorne Court Council, who moved to the co-op in 1986. “It was more about people living in a noisy city and wanting a quiet respite.”<br /><br />Those in favor of changing the rules maintained that the lawn would be fine and that children were more prone to injury on the paved pathways.<br /><br />The measure did not pass.<br /><br />That year, Adam Koplan and Nicole Citron, who were expecting their first child, bought a three-bedroom in the Hawthorne Court with the idea that they would soon be having picnics in the garden. “Real estate agents were kind of making promises that no matter what the stated policy was of the building at that moment, by the time we had our kid, for sure, they’d be able to play in the garden,” said Mr. Koplan, 43, the artistic director for the Flying Carpet Theater Company, who is now planning to move with his family to Atlanta for unrelated reasons.<br /><br />But when their elder daughter, Nina, was born the following spring, the rules were still firmly in place. Increasingly, the idea of keeping their child off the grass in their own backyard seemed absurd. Having been picked up each time she wandered off the paved walkways inside the co-op garden, Nina, who is now 8, developed an aversion to grass. “For the first couple of years, she would look at me for clearance to make sure it was O.K.,” said Mr. Koplan, describing the quizzical look she would give her parents when she came across a patch of grass outside the co-op. “It was like she internalized the struggle.”<br /><br />As the under-5-year-old set at the Hawthorne Court increased in number, a committee was formed to “review and advise on lawn access.” In 2009, a survey of residents was conducted and a proposal was carefully drafted to institute a trial period during the summer of 2010 in which residents could “gently use the lawn” on Thursday and Friday evenings. Even that move was defeated. Grass protectionists argued that limited lawn access for special events like a community barbecue and Easter egg hunt was good enough.<br /><br />“At that point there was a real souring amongst the young family types,” Mr. Koplan said. “The point of view was, if they’re not going to be reasonable and negotiate at all, to what extent do we even need to listen to this.”<br /><br />But given human nature, barbecues, which were sanctioned in paved areas behind apartment houses, began to spill out onto the grass. Children were occasionally spotted darting across the lawn.<br /><br />“I rolled out a yoga mat on the grass right next to the sidewalk,” said Ms. Citron, 43, who works in pharmaceutical market research. An outraged older resident sent an email to the co-op president. “The upside to that was I was referenced in the letter as ‘some teenager,’ ” she said.<br /><br />The situation “got a bit acrimonious,” said Meg Fry, 48, who moved to the Hawthorne Court in 2005 with her husband, Mike Novak, and 1-year-old son, David, now 12. “I think there was also sort of an air of entitlement by some of the younger families at times,” she said, not excluding herself. “These apartments were getting more and more expensive, and sometimes when you spend that much on an apartment, when you move in, you want everything your way.”<br /><br />It didn’t help that nearby garden co-ops including the Linden Court, the Laburnum Court and the Greystones were doing away with similar rules of their own.<br /><br />Diana Delgrosso, who has lived at the Greystones since 1981 and is a self-described “old-timer” at age 82, was among the contingent opposed to greater lawn access. “Our philosophy is completely different from the new young people moving in, and it sometimes causes a little rift,” she said, noting that noise levels and trash accumulation were among her concerns.<br /><br />But since the Greystones opened up its lawn in 2012, she has come around to the idea. “I’m O.K. with it so long as they’re civilized,” she said, noting that the noise level sometimes gets out of hand, especially when children’s birthday parties are held on the lawn. “When they’re screaming, I yell out of the window, ‘Stop screaming!’ ” she added with a laugh.<br /><br />Friction is a given in co-op living, where residents buy shares in a corporation for a proprietary lease in the building and expect to have a certain amount of say in how it is run. “Anytime you have shared space or common areas, there is the potential for proverbial sparks to fly,” said Barry Weidenbaum, a New York real estate lawyer. “For many years, co-op and condo smoking policies were the hot topic.”<br /><br />Enforcement of house rules can also be tricky.<br /><br />For example, at the Chateau, a nearby 12-building garden co-op with yard rules that date to the early 1920s, a grass-walking ban is still in effect, according to Larry Papa, a 21-year resident and a co-op representative. “If I’m around and see someone on the lawn, children running around or whatever, I remind them, ‘Hey guys, you’re not supposed to be on the lawn.’ ”<br /><br />After years of debate at the Hawthorne Court, so many people were flagrantly stepping on the grass that many board members felt enforcement of a ban had become futile. Last spring, “in an effort to promote harmonious living,” said Mary Reddy, the president of the Hawthorne Court Council, a group of residents was rounded up to “come up with some rules that would be agreeable to all.” Ball playing, Frisbee throwing and bike riding are still not permitted, nor are pets allowed. But residents are welcome to run, walk or socialize on the grass as long as they are “respectful, courteous and neighborly,” according to the new rules, which were passed by a majority vote.<br /><br />“There were some that were unhappy with it,” Ms. Reddy said, “but I think they’ve kind of fallen in and gotten to like it.”<br /><br />Last month, on a warm spring evening, Nina Koplan, the little girl who once had an aversion to grass, glanced out the window and saw one of her friends out on the lawn. Though she still asked permission from her parent to run out and play, this time she didn’t hesitate to run right across the grass.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				&nbsp;Thanks r, for posting that older NYTimes article! There has been an evolution in JH with all the lovely private gardens becoming much less precious for residents. It&#039;s a great compromise. I do, however, think the operative word here is &quot;shrieking&quot;. There is a special pitch that some youngsters have when their voices are loud that is earsplitting. One of our neighbors is great in asking her daughter not to use that voice and getting her to think about how it affects people. Parents can make a difference here! I would make sure those watching the children are actually aware of the sounds and how they affect someone&#039;s quality of life while still allowing the kids lots of free play. They may have become immune over time. Many co-op buildings have lovely green spaces and all residents should be able to enjoy that amenity in an equitable way.

But I recognize this shrieking sound, pitch, whatever you want to call it and it&#039;s very unpleasant. Kids can definitely play, laugh, run around, and avoid this sound completely at the same time.

Several people have posted on this topic like it&#039;s an either/or situation. &quot;Well, I&#039;d rather hear kids screaming than airplanes, leaf blowers, construction, etc.&quot;&nbsp; Some people don&#039;t mind the sounds of children screaming; some people do.&nbsp; <br /><br />And this is an unfair comparison, 80JHer. The original poster, realitycookie, did not say it was 45 minutes of children laughing. He/she said it was &quot;shrieking&quot;, and as several people have acknowledged, there is a difference between the sounds created by lighthearted children&#039;s play, and the noise created when kids get too loud and they are screaming and shrieking. Also, nowhere was it stated that it was 45 minutes. For all you know, it could have been several hours. (I know I have witnessed 3+ hours of kids screaming, and it was very disruptive). Presumably, the construction work on the building is a necessary project and, by its very nature, it can&#039;t be done elsewhere. Parents can, and should, take kids to Travers Park for loud play activities.<br />

				I tend to agree that the sound of children playing is hardly a social problem. Leaf blowers are another matter. The gas-powered ones not only produce noise, but also substantial pollution that is a threat to anyone who uses them or is around them. They have been banned in a number of municipalities. There are things that we can control and things we cannot. Helicopters, ambulances and 3am shootings obviously fit in the latter category. However, in the case of leaf blowers, there are battery-powered ones that produce nowhere near the noise and pollution and are already being used by supers in a number of buildings.

				Look to the people (parents) on your board. In my building we have a couple of parents on the board who feel that every amenity in the building must cater to the (their) children in the building and that anything done to that end is fine. <br /><br />This includes turning the backyard into a park, which it&#039;s not supposed to be. (garden does not equal park). Personally i am not trouble by this since i face the front, but the point is get involved with your board if you&#039;d like to have a say, and speak for those who feel as you do.&nbsp;

				The leaf lowers and construction are one thing, but the regular nighttime karaoke concerts from the neighboring building are getting to be a bit much! Whoever is singing can’t carry a tune, but their voice sure carries!&nbsp; ::)
