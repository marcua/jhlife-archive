			Does anybody remember my grandfather&#039;s deli on 81st Street and Roosevelt Avenue. He bought in the early 1950s and sold it in the 1980s. It was painted red outside and the Democrat Club was on the 2nd floor. My grandfather&#039;s name was Nick, his brother was Gus and the third person I remember working there was Bill.&nbsp; He had about 10 of the the old delivery type bicycles and on Saturday&#039;s there was always a long line waiting for cold cuts. The deli had a wooden floor and there was always sawdust on it to keep it clean.
