				<strong>What was your biggest housing mistake?</strong><br /><br />The Times today has an article about the mistakes people have made when they have rented or purchased apartments in NYC. &nbsp;They range from:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>a first floor apartment where the super washed the windows with blasts of water from a hose at 7:30am on weekends</li><li>a first floor apartment near a church where groups of people loitered noisily outside, not just on Sundays, but on other days for AA meetings</li><li>an apartment with loud noise from passing trucks</li><li>a mice-infested apartment</li><li>an apartment that looked out over the backstage for the loud musical Stomp</li></ul><br /><br />December 6, 2009<br /><strong>The Big Mistake </strong> <br />By TERI KARUSH ROGERS<br />WHEN it comes to homes and spouses, one bad experience can alter a personâ€™s choices forever. <br /><br />And in New York City, where there are untold challenges to vertical living, a seemingly endless number of pitfalls lie in the real estate road.<br /><br />Bad choices include: the location of oneâ€™s building, insufferable neighbors both human and feral, long-distance supers, heat-conducting windows and prized amenities that turn out to be booby prizes.<br /><br />Consider the unfortunate story of Rob Paladino. Three years ago, he rented a one-bedroom pied-Ã -terre on the fifth floor of a new apartment building in the garment district. For $3,800 a month, he got a generous 600-square-foot patio, built above four floors of retail space on top of the buildingâ€™s first setback.<br /><br />â€œIt was a big feature, and I really believed it was worth the extra few hundred dollars a month,â€ said Mr. Paladino, a single 52-year-old digital media entrepreneur who looked forward to entertaining friends outdoors.<br /><br />Soon after unpacking, Mr. Paladino furnished his outdoor space with a table and chairs, a barbecue and Christmas lights.<br /><br />Then came the cigarette butts: incendiary paratroopers raining down from Mr. Paladinoâ€™s neighbors â€” 40 stories of them, or about 280 apartments. Mr. Paladino thinks his neighbors, mostly young professionals sharing places, assumed the butts would float to the street.<br /><br />Instead, â€œthey would burn through my awning and the patio chairs,â€ he said. â€œI would make a game trying to figure out what the brands were.â€ (Lots of Newports, he said.)<br /><br />link to article &nbsp;(http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/realestate/06cov.html?pagewanted=1)

				<em><strong>I HAVE ONE FOR YOU...Just Happened a couple of weeks ago<br /><br />This couple moved into the basement apartment at Calloway. it&#039;s a converted unit...used to be a large Studio - $1300 per month. The first day she calls desperately to tell the landlord that there is a dog next door. Well, she assumed there were no dogs in the building because we told her specifically &quot;NO PETS ALLOWED&quot;. The new owner just doesn&#039;t want the newly renovated apartment ruined by an overly active pet. Turns out she is extremely allergic to dogs and she wanted out. She called the landlord everyday to let her off the lease and he called me to ask what should he do. &nbsp;I told him...&quot;let them off the lease&quot;. If the lady is saying the truth a judge would side with the tenant for &quot;medical&quot; reasons. Plus...you don&#039;t want to deal with an unhappy tenant anyway.</strong></em>
