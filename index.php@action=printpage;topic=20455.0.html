				&nbsp;There are many back channels here in Jackson Heights. Some are fascinating, some are historic and some are god awful. Many kids have learned to ride bikes and skate there. Lot&#039;s of basement entrances are popular. Some have a small piece of paradise right behind their homes. Gardens abound. And some nastiness also. Have you explored them? I believe these are public spaces but am not sure.

				&nbsp;Behind many of the homes in the lower 70&#039;s on the streets, not avenues. I know that there are more in the 90&#039;s too. Some are great and some are ignored and trashed but I posted this as I have a view of two different ones. In the one, for a year now there is an exercise regime with women and sometimes children in one that they might be too shy to do on open street or playground. The other has lots of basement apartments so a different world happens in that alley which is almost like having a back door in a suburban house with plants and mops hanging, cars can drive right up and it&#039;s a first floor or basement existence. Both are very different looking from the street side. A few have really terrific setups and regularly entertain adults and kids.

				We&#039;ve rented two parking spots in those alleys--which we never knew existed before we answered ads for the parking spots. It&#039;s like another world--lots of back porches and in nice weather, people entertaining, cooking on grills, hanging out, etc. We started doing this over the summer, but once winter arrived, found it a bit daunting to get in and out of the parking spot, because it&#039;s pitch black in the alley--no streetlights of course, and nobody seems to have outside lighting there, as there often is for houses and yards.

				my ex and i had a home on 75th, on one of those &quot;community driveways,&quot; as our neighbors put it. we rented out the parking spot, but maintained the back yard (on the other side of the driveway) as a garden/yard. some people paved over theirs, which bummed me out. we had a low-wattage light on a timer on the garage, which offered some light, but the overall stretch was pretty dark

				My guess is that these alleys are NOT public spaces, but probably governed by an easement that all of the homeowners on the block have in common. Therefore, only the homeowners and/or their invited guests should be using them.
