				Tonight as I was walking home along 37th Avenue, I noticed a cop car was parked in the pedestrian crosswalk on the corner of 37th Ave/83rd Street. It was blocking traffic on one side and blocking the sidewalk curb ramp for wheelchairs and strollers.<br /><br />At first I thought there was an emergency since the car was parked so strangely and without a care. But then I saw two female officers in Cafe de Colombia drinking coffee and eating cake.<br /><br />I was livid. I stayed by the cop car and took pictures and then called 311 to make a report. The 311 rep. took down my details but I received the typical &quot;case closed&quot; email less than an hour later. <br /><br />I watched as elderly pedestrians tried to navigate across 37th Avenue with that cop car parked directly where it SHOULDN&#039;T be.<br /><br />Can someone please tell me who else I can go to about this issue? This is NOT the first time this has happened. It is arrogant, self-indulgent and dangerous.<br /><br />Photos here: https://imgur.com/a/pfsl8UA (https://imgur.com/a/pfsl8UA)<br />

				I passed by around the same time, and I noticed those things as well, but I didn&#039;t put 2 and 2 together. Do you think it would help to report it to Daniel Dromm&#039;s office?

				They do this in the crosswalk in front of K&amp;L Deli all the time. I don&#039;t know how people with wheelchairs and strollers are supposed to get onto the sidewalk, it&#039;s really inconsiderate.

				They do this by 711 as well and down the block their is a car that blocks the hydrant and is in the crosswalk with a police badge sticker in the window. They never get a ticket. If another car parks there, they get ticketed. There is also a car parked on 82 street near st joan of arc (for years) that has a cover on it and never moves for street cleanings and never gets ticketed/towed.

				I would send those photos to the precinct and let them know that people in the neighborhood are talking about it on social media. The parking job was worse than I expected and it&#039;s really bad optics for them. However, I feel like the 115th is poorly run so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they blow it off.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Our neighborhood community officers:<br />PO Bryan Leibold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryan.Leibold@nypd.org<br />PO Tyler Scala&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tyler.Scala@nypd.org<br /><br />Or if you prefer to call:<br />Precinct: (718) 533-2002<br />Community Affairs: (718) 533-2010<br /><br />Oooh, I just found this article which makes this even worse, in my opinion. You&#039;d think they&#039;d be warned not to do this kind of thing considering what is going on:<br /><br />https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2019/03/18/three-more-precincts-filled-with-recklessly-driving-s-cop-laws/ (https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2019/03/18/three-more-precincts-filled-with-recklessly-driving-s-cop-laws/)

				they do it everywhere. our office in Tribeca is about two blocks from a precinct house there, and there&#039;s one narrow stretch of West Broadway where their private cars are parked, placards in window, so that pedestrians have to walk in a busy street. it&#039;s one of the perks of the job, i guess.

				I see unmarked civilian cars parked directly in front of fire hydrants all the time, and peering through the window the inevitable NYPD sticker that says basically &quot;I can do whatever I want&quot;.&nbsp; It is nothing but brazen disregard for the law and the safety of the community.&nbsp; There is a protected class and then there is everyone else.&nbsp; Par for the course in every society that ever lived anywhere.
