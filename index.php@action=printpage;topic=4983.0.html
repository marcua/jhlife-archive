				The security camera displayed 3AM on&nbsp; Sunday morning.&nbsp; Thank God for Security cameras they got great pictures of the perps.&nbsp; The little punk who is laughing while the tall one has the gun pointed at the victim&#039;s head is particularly disgusting.

				This is scary. I live nearby and would not walk alone at that hour. Please watch out and try to come home earlier if at all <br />possible or take a car service the few blocks from the station which I know is a pain. Is the victim ok for now? Sorry this<br />happened.

				I don&#039;t think it was ever said he was followed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did offer suggestions, some culled from our meeting at the 115th last year, about safety ideas when people are coming home from the train.&nbsp; That may be where the idea was planted he was followed (apologies if that mislead anyone).<br /><br />It all comes down to trying (and its hard) to keep one&#039;s wits about them in a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation.&nbsp; Head to a crowded place.&nbsp; Keep alert of groups up ahead.&nbsp; And the like.

				<br />Queens<br /><br />A member of an Elmhurst stickup crew was nabbed for mugging a straphanger of his iPhone and $60, sources said. <br /><br />A tipster led cops to 17-year-old Samuel Johnson&#039;s Bronx home and linked him to the July 11 gunpoint mugging, authorities said. <br /><br />Three thugs allegedly followed the 20-year-old victim from the Roosevelt Avenue subway station into a nearby building at 3 a.m. <br /><br />The armed suspects then swarmed him and swiped the man&#039;s phone and cash, sources said. <br /><br />Cops said Johnson was caught on-camera rifling through the victim&#039;s pockets while a grinning accomplice stood by. <br /><br />Johnson faces charges of robbery and criminal possession of stolen property, said a spokesman for DA Richard Brown.<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_blotter/nypd_daily_blotter_02lMexlnWFGygHxdAGnQWN#ixzz0uVFqTodq<br />

				Go figure, from the boogie down Bronx. It&#039;s just a matter of time before he sings like<br />a bird and rats out his 2 associates. No plea bargain b.s. Most likely these thugs were<br />on the same train as the mugging victim. 3 young male blacks hanging outside the train<br />station at 3:00am would certainly draw suspicion. <br /><br />So much for NYPD&#039;s Impact program,what is the cutoff for the 115th precinct? 73rd St?<br />There had to be cops walking the beat on Roosevelt around that time no?

And guess what ? Late night is when most muggings occur. And Marcus why do people rob people at night ? Because they&#039;re are less people out, and most people coming home at that time have been drinking. And yes muggers look for easy prey.

Go ask some people who lived in JH/Elmhurst and Corona what it was like during the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I understand the importance of being prudent, but -- <br /><br />This can potentially lead to a vicious circle where the fear of crime prevents people from walking home or going out in the evening, which in turn leads to less people on the streets, which then leads to more crime, which in turn creates more fear and reduces the number of people on the street still further.&nbsp; <br /><br />In an urban neighborhood like Jackson Heights (or NYC as a whole) I do not think that being able to walk home from a bar or restaurant after midnight should ever be a â€œfantasy islandâ€ expectation --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

If you&#039;re street smart , you make it harder for stick up kids to operate. So instead of mugging a person who has been drinking at 3 am. They have to mug someone coming home from work at midnight. That increases the chances that these people will get caught.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Where did you grow up ?&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m 6 foot, weigh 235 lbs,&nbsp; lift weights 4 times a week. Shaved head the whole nine. And you know what , when I go out drinking , I save 10 bucks , so I can get home without any incidents . If you want to take chances..go ahead.

				I agree 100% with Metsboy,I am not as big as him but I am not an easy target. Criminals<br />look for an easy mark,period. People still wear their ipod headphones and wonder why they<br />keep getting mugged. Cardinal rule number 1: never advertise. (2)Don&#039;t look afraid,they will<br />sense this and take advantage of it.<br /><br />So what could have he done to prevent this? Ok,first off he should have kept on walking,now they<br />know where he lives,who knows what the thugs friends might do someday. Now he would have <br />had a better chance to avoid getting mugged outside his apt. Once he was in the lobby he was<br />trapped so to speak. I know I am second guessing but that is what I think.

				Personally, I agree with the elements of the post saying beware and be forewarned. I don&#039;t think this area is unsafe but<br />ANYWHERE you are at 3:00am if you are a person who is not the strongest looking, would mark you as vulnerable. I was<br />first jumped at age 11 and bit the guy who I left crying on the ground with my teeth marks drawing blood on his arm.<br />From then on I became hyperconscious of these possibilities and I have heard of attacks in all economic areas. Usually<br />at night, usually single people alone though our super was brutally beaten for a chain in the East 50&#039;s not long ago and <br />this was at 4:00am. I live near the attack area and when I go out alone for a late night, I save a portion of the money for <br />a cab which is usually $5. or $6. -less than a drink in many places. A few more swings by of a patrol car now and <br />then might be helpful as I don&#039;t see them often. Also agree that African Americans are not a big population here and <br />three young men together is pretty unusual in this area now. This is something my black friends would immediately <br />point out.

				I knew this thread was going to get a lot of action. Crime affects us all whether directly<br />or indirectly. No need to be packing heat,that is just asking for trouble as well as illegal.<br />If you want to pack some heat at home,that is fine because that is your territory and you<br />have every right to defend yourself and your property.<br /><br />I think everybody should take a few self defense courses,no need to learn kung fu, a few<br />basic simple moves is all that is needed. Just know what to do when and if something<br />goes down. Most of us on here will never get mugged during our lifetime but sometimes<br />things happen.

				It&#039;s not just a couple of bucks to take a cab. It costs $2.50 just to get into a cab, plus the night surcharge and NYS tax add another dollar. The ride from downtown invariably costs at least $20 to Jackson Heights, and that&#039;s before a tip. So coming home at night one needs to weigh the cost of a cab against a likely 1 1/2 hour subway ride, since the trains run maybe every 20 minutes, and there&#039;s often construction disrupting the usual route. So yeah, you leave the performance or party or bar or place of employment at 1 or 1:30 am, take the subway, and don&#039;t get home until 3.<br /><br />What we need are safe streets-- which fortunately, most of the time we do have. And when we don&#039;t, we do need to jump up and down about it. I&#039;m glad at least one of the perps was caught.

				How do you know which night you&#039;re going to be mugged so that you know to get a cab/car service? Because if you&#039;re spending money EVERY time you come home late, that&#039;s a lot of $8 trips from 74th to my building. And if you&#039;re not going to be mugged, that&#039;s kind of a waste. Maybe you have money to throw around, I don&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;m a musician and I come home late a LOT and have never had a problem.

				Exactly, some people just don&#039;t want to look outside of the box,they only see what they want to see.<br />So the mugging victim had $60.00 in his wallet, yet he choose to walk the few blocks from the subway<br />station to his apt.<br /><br />Guaranteed he wouldn&#039;t have been mugged had he hailed a cab which at that time of night are plentiful<br />around the subway station.

				We are lucky that a lot of cabs are available around the subway station pretty much around the clock â€“ and I totally agree that if someone is coming out of a bar at 3AM completely blitzed, spending a few bucks for a cab is the best option â€“ <br /><br />My guess is that most of the people who come home late (including all the people who work late or people who are coming home from concerts, ball games etc.) are sober (or more or less sober) and can and do make it home on foot OK without being an obvious target for someone with criminal intent.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If this incident encourages people to demand a greater police presence, good security cameras in all building lobbies and other effective crime fighting tools, then something good will have come from it.&nbsp; On the other hand, if it discourages people from going out at night because they feel the streets are somehow becoming too dangerous (and that if you canâ€™t afford a cab you have to stay at home) then that would be a really bad outcome -- and could create a situation that would ultimately lead to more not less crimeâ€¦ <br />

				It never occurred to me to take a cab from the station, but I live only a couple of blocks away. Do a lot of people take cabs from the station late at night? Is that a Jackson Heights thing? Do people take cabs for a walk under 10 minutes? For safety reasons? I guess the availability of cabs makes it easier to consider.

I live on 74th St, somewhere between Woodside Ave and Queens Blvd and guess in which direction the muggers run to 99% of the time(yep towards the 74th St<br />subway station where they came from in the first place.

				What makes you think a cab is safe?&nbsp; There have been a slew of assaults and rapes in Chelsea over the years of people going home in cabs from the clubs and bars and drivers pushing people out in the completely wrong place.&nbsp; In Chelsea it was safer to walk.<br /><br />This robbery took place less than 2 blocks from the train.&nbsp; A cab driver would laugh at you if you asked to cab it that short of a distance. I know cause I&#039;ve asked and they laughed.<br /><br />TiPs: If you put a friend in a cab you don&#039;t know, text or write down the time, number and name of the driver. At least, when you go MIA the police will have a lead.<br /><br />Get to know a friendly/safe neighborhood cabbie and carry his number with you.<br /><br />Take a self DEFENSE class.<br /><br />Carry a pocket knife (under 4 inches please, its the law.
