I’ve also been looking forward to Arepa Lady’s opening. Their last space on 77th was much smaller, but they somehow managed well with the seating arrangement. Given that, I’m sure they’ll get a good crowd going once they’re settled in the larger space. I’m only a block away, so this may get dangerous...&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				This place is continuing to be completely mobbed.<br /><br />It&#039;s like a crowded party every night.<br /><br />Ok, if I were to open a restaurant biz, it would be a hip arepas place, for sure.<br /><br />I am predicting franchises all over the world!<br /><br />

				My wife and I went last week. It was delicious. But I have to say (and I know this will sound sacrilegious), I&#039;m personally more partial to the arepas at the Venezuelan &quot;Arepas Cafe&quot; in Astoria. They&#039;re both excellent quality. I just think Arepas Cafe has a more delicious variety of options. I&#039;ve got enough love (and appetite) for both though!

				They probably only accept cash because the credit card fees they&#039;re charged cut into whatever slim profit they are making.

				It&#039;s been years since she did that, but... maybe a combination? Ms. Cano&nbsp; made everything herself there and she had/has a great touch. It could also be pure sentiment kicking in.

				I can completely understand cashless. But not to accept a credit card in a restaurant? Peter Luger, or Arepa Lady, just always seemed shady to me.

				Cash is legal tender. If you leave $52.40 in cash plus tip for a meal that costs that amount and the owner declined it, leave. Let them call the cops and have you charged with paying for your purchase.

				The comment was about not accepting credit cards--it was not about not accepting cash. I don&#039;t know of any restaurants that don&#039;t accept cash, but there are fast food/takeout places that don&#039;t. It&#039;s a trend, a weird one, which I hope does not become the norm.

				The reason many restaurants only take cash is that the banks/credit card companies take between 2.5% and 3.5% of each transaction plus, often, a 25¢ swipe fee. If Arepa Lady were to swipe $1,000,000 in transactions in a year, that&#039;d be tens of thousands of dollars going to a bank. I&#039;d rather see that money go to employees. There are also many other reasons a restaurant would choose to be cash only, especially in this political climate.

				I think the primary reason why they don&#039;t accept credit cards is that they don&#039;t have to claim the profits to the IRS.&nbsp; Such places pay minimum wage to their employees.&nbsp; Even the smallest deli on 37th avenue accepts credit cards.

				well, there are thousands of stores and restaurants in NYC -- and hundreds of thousands across America -- who are cheating the IRS. fortunately, the IRS isn&#039;t paying its workers during the shutdown, so until the fence is built, tax cheating won&#039;t be prosecuted.<br /><br />seriously, i&#039;ve been in bars in Mississippi, bbq joints in North Carolina, pierogi places in Ohio and clubs in rural Texas that don&#039;t accept credit cards. it&#039;s really not that rare.

				https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-cash-is-no-good-here-literally-11546013696<br /><br />I seem to remember a chapter in one of Heinlein&#039;s books (Time Enough for Love, perhaps) where the protagonists had a conflict with a club owner who didn&#039;t want to take cash. Prophetic!<br />
