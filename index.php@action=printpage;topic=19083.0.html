				La Fusta has been in business for 45 years and attracts loyal customers from throughout the City and outside the City many who once lived here and can afford their prices.&nbsp; La Fusta has old world charm, atmosphere and a full bar including Sangria.&nbsp; Gallo Churrasqueira is like dining in a former bagel shop and for drinks they will be serving soda, lemonade and bottle water.&nbsp; They will have to depend strictly on locals and not many here can afford to pay $18.95 for a chicken.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m referring to the place that opened in the former Greek restaurant on 86th and 37th. It bills itself Portuguese, but it&#039;s mostly a wider array of Latin cuisines. We tried it earlier this week and it&#039;s pretty good. They grill and roast their meats there, and the piri piri chicken I had was well-seasoned and marinated. The sausage was also very good. Aside from meat, they also have seafood. One nice thing is they sell their meats a la carte -- you can just get a chicken leg, a skewer of shrimp, or a sausage etc. Check them out. <br /><br /><strong>Similar topics merged by moderator.</strong>

				will have to try it out. i like the a la carte idea, which is easy to do at a steam table, but harder at even casual sitdown places, which usually offer tiered combo platters.

				We went there for lunch the other day, really liked the ability to order one rib, one piece of beef, sausage, etc. The menu was all over the place, but the grilled meats were satisfying. My 14 y/o daughter thought the chicken &quot;tastes burnt&quot;, but truth is it exceeded my expectations. <br />
