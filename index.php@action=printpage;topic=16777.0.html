				Regarding the plans. We&#039;re trying to get tree guards or, if that isn&#039;t possible, grates to protect the soil around trees and their roots against compaction. Otherwise those trees will face a very hostile environment with all that foot traffic.<br />Unfortunately the trees they are planting in the main section of the plaza, honey locusts, do not cast very much shade. But the merchants were worried that pedestrians won&#039;t see their business signs with more formidable trees, not really a valid worry since people are on foot walking slowly rather than speeding by on a commercial strip in the suburbs.

Many of the trees that the city plants are not native and have little or no value for wildlife. I realize their priority is to find species of trees that can withstand tough urban conditions, but I&#039;d think there would be enough of a selection of native trees for this. I think the honey locusts are a good choice for that area as they are really tough trees that can withstand a lot. I believe there are some planted in that area around 74th and you wouldn&#039;t know what they withstand by looking at them. They are tough trees as are the sweet gum!<br /><br />I&#039;m excited to hear work has begun. It looks like construction may begin on Travers Park later this year as well. It&#039;s a slow process, but it&#039;s happening!

				Union labor as required by the city tends to not be very quick or cheap. These workers stretch the work out. At least the new sidewalks are clean. Soon with all the grease from the restaurants they will turn black again. Too bad they don&#039;t install those wifi towers where the food carts are.

				Local trash problem is a direct result of the food carts who spit out food all day. The people then fill up the sanitation baskets. Sometimes the customers throw the half eaten food anywhere.

I see a lot of garbage and trash on the east side of 73rd between the plaza and 37th, along the sidewalk near the businesses. It gets really gross there. (It&#039;s especially lovely a day or two after it snows!) And I think the businesses there <em>are</em> responsible for cleaning that up, even if they didn&#039;t create it.

				The food carts don&#039;t really cause a lot of the garbage. The cans around 73rd / 74th Street fill up fast because the brick and mortar businesses throw their trash out in the cans. Have personally seen this many, many times. The restaurants also dump their grease down the sewers (looking at you Kabab King and Merit Kabab!), which will require a reckoning one of these days.

				The carts cause all the garbage and pour their oil down the catch basin. The worst part is they illegally park their supply vans all day in metered spots. They take away three or four spots daily. I don&#039;t see the restaurants that pay for their garbage to be removed as trying to fill the trash bins. It makes no sense.

				Those big cargo vans that are there all day and have the side doors open and that the workers are pulling meat and other supplies all day long belong to the adjacent carts. You would have to blind not to have seen them. Also they use the white styrofoam containers that are seen all over 73rd Street and Broadway as their customers leave the mess behind only to have the bank employees clean up the mess. The manager of the bank told me that they constantly get tickets based on the mess from the night before, and before they even open for business.

				the cargo vans supply the markets. they usually contain large carcasses. whole goats and lambs. the carts don&#039;t butcher and break down whole animals on the sidewalk, nor do they do so in the vans. the vans that haul vegetables haul huge bags. none of the carts in question go through 100s of pounds of onions per day.&nbsp;

				You seem to be confused.&nbsp; :-\ I am referring to the white vans that are parked all day everyday behind the food carts. They are parked in metered spots and have regular passenger license plates (even though they have all the seats removed and are being used for commercial purposes). These three white vans are owned by the cart owners and illegally hog four parking spots from the general public. These carts are too close to the entrance to the bank. The reason Subzi Mandi closed was that there was parking for customers and high rent. Even the bank has to employ tow trucks to move illegally parked cars from its lot. The bank pays $250k in property taxes a year, the carts pay $0 and throw all the sanitation tickets on the bank. They don&#039;t pay rent, and yet collect $1500 a day in profit for each cart. Why run a legal business when NYC and its police don&#039;t enforce the law.

				&nbsp;I just hope it doesn&#039;t feel like an all male- many of them drunk/high- area again after all of this upheaval.

				This area has always been home to homeless, prostitution and day laborers. That is only likely to increase because plans are to include a bathroom in the plaza. Also because there are nearby food carts and the tables and chairs this is likely to be a area full of white styrofoam containers with some food left over. Public plazas work only if you have civilized citizens that use the tables and clean up after themselves. That is why they work in Manhattan. This closure of the street was made basically to disrupt the cars making a left turn onto 74th Street to alleviate the traffic of Indian stores.

				Exactly. We do have in the area a great amount of people from different parts of the world but that does not mean we have to adopt their sanitation standards. The fifth that is allowed to flourish around 73rd and 74th Street would not be allowed in many parts of the United States. Those three food carts are only adding to the problem.

				Agree with Sky23--and I think that the city has removed garbage cans? There used to be one on my corner but not anymore. Agree that 73-74 Sts. are shockingly garbage strewn--people toss garbage into the tree wells as if that&#039;s where it belongs! And from my admittedly limited amount of world travel, I agree that a big issue is cultural differences in how public areas are expected to be maintained. In some parts of the world, this level of mess, for lack of a better word, or an even higher level is simply the norm. And very surprising/offputting to the eyes of someone not used to it. <br /><br />

The many&nbsp; shoppers--and loitering customers--dropping their trash along 73rd&nbsp; and 74th street and 37th avenue is a bigger issue than the plaza, in my opinion. <br /><br />Last I noticed, there are garbage cans on each corner of every intersection on 37th from around 75th or 76th street street up but not one on any corner below there. This may be because sanitation removed them due to too much household garbage being dumped, I don&#039;t know. But only one store around there even has a sign that says &quot;Customers please don&#039;t throw your garbage on the street&quot;<br /><br />Obviously the plaza wasn&#039;t fancy before this reno and agree it probably won&#039;t be ideal after, but I often saw women and children there, and think it’s much better for the general vicinity since they closed that little street to traffic. <br /><br />It&nbsp; seemed very well-used by assorted members of the JH/Elmhurst community who were not prostitutes, drunks, drug addicts and/or homeless. People like that were hanging around and inside that subway entrance well before the street was closed, they’re just more visible by comparison to all the regular people who are also using the area since the traffic is gone. In general, the seediness level seems much better to me than when cars and buses dominated.<br /><br />I remain hopeful the renovated plaza will be a positive influence over time, and in any case think it’s much better than it was.<br />

				There are several issues to consider here, but I really can&#039;t see what is going to change once the plaza is completed.&nbsp; It was no place I would have brought my family.&nbsp; It was dominated almost exclusively by men, many of which were unsavory characters...homeless,&nbsp; mentally disturbed, drug addicts, alcoholics all set up residence there.&nbsp; &nbsp;The plaza and surrounding streets were/is&nbsp; pretty much filthy.&nbsp; Few, if any of the store owners clean the outside of their stores. Several months ago I saw a restaurant owner dump&nbsp; pots of cooked food in one of the tree surrounds on 74th street (buffet time for the rats).&nbsp; There are no trash cans on the surrounding blocks in question because of all the illegal SRO&#039;s.&nbsp; Most of the cans overflowing are due to the fact that people dump their garbage from home in them, thus cumulatively adding to the garbage. Finally, there are the &quot;out of towners&quot; who swarm to the neighborhood to shop.&nbsp; Double parked cars block&nbsp; traffic and cause an incredible amount of car horn beeping, fumes and yes.... garbage as well. Most of these issues have been ignored because the store owners do not want enforcement as it will detract people from coming to the neighborhood to shop. In that respect, I think&nbsp; local politicians have dropped the ball.&nbsp; If this is to be successful, there needs to be consistent monitoring and enforcement.

				Actually not really. While NYC was in an economic downturn in the 1970’s, Jackson Heights in period of time was home to a higher socioeconomic class. Later as Jackson Heights became the center of the drug trade and money laundering with many stores acting as fronts, the upper middle class left. Stores on 82nd street would cater to a different client base. In addition Jackson Heights became home to many more South Asian and Hispanic populations. The 73 and 74th section would be unrecognizable to current residents. So yes Jackson Heights was better off in the 1970’s.

				From Wikipedia on Jackson Heights:<br /><br />The Latino demographics caused controversy in the 1970s, when many drug cartels were selling drugs, even though most people were not actually affected by it. While some media sources placed culpability on the wire transfer stores along Roosevelt Avenue as vestiges of the drug-selling, these stores were actually useful to the community.[54] Latino clubs and bars on the avenue were also pointed to as evidence, though most were just places for typical Latino immigrants to hang out.[54]<br /><br />I guess people are afraid of the truth. Isn’t it getting old always playing the race card?

				Interesting how this topic has gone off the rails. I was originally opposed to Diversity Plaza because it became a second home for the local alcoholics and drug addicts who occasionally confront commuters trying to go about their business. However it&#039;s potential became evident after the earthquake I Nepal when it became a focal point for community support to the victims. We need an open space in this area, but it has to be safe and clean. If it is kept safe and clean then I look forward to it reopening.

				^Indeed, I haven&#039;t participated in your poll because, as previously stated, it is poorly conceived or biased. <br /><br />Note how the poll gives no option for a &quot;no&quot; that isn&#039;t specifically about viewing it as a waste of taxpayer money or too filled with undesirable people. For example, no consideration that someone who lives on say, 89th &amp; 34th Avenue might view the plaza itself favorably but wouldn&#039;t really plan to use it since that&#039;s a big enough distance from the Plaza to make it unlikely someone would use it. Note also how the poll includes a &quot;Yes&quot; answer that is not related to the actual question of the poll itself (walking by the plaza is not using the facilities, just like my walking by the jewelry stores on 74th street does not make me a patron).<br /><br />I am free to criticize your poorly thought out poll, and perhaps if that ruffles your feathers, you should revisit your decision to post a poll.<br /><br />

				Participatory budgeting? Well you don’t live in Dromm’s district of Jackson Heights who doesn’t believe in this form of direct democracy. No, he and he only decides where the money gets spent with no input from the residents. That’s why he decided to waste 5 million on this project. The reason it seems about right is you have no idea how much construction really costs. A tree costs $500, benches $2000 tops, no were near over $50,000 for all these items.&nbsp;

LOL, That&#039;s not true at all. What are you basing that on? Two year old trees would rarely survive as street trees. Before you point out some newly planted trees by the city that you saw die, obviously when you are dealing with plants some die. The city does a great job at keeping that at a minimum. <br /><br />Here&#039;s some info about how NYC street trees a procured:<br /><br />https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/street-tree-planting/steps (https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/street-tree-planting/steps)<br /><br />https://www.nycgovparks.org/pagefiles/52/Tree_Procurement.pdf (https://www.nycgovparks.org/pagefiles/52/Tree_Procurement.pdf)<br /><br />And here&#039;s an image of a young girl standing next to a two-year old apple tree:<br /><br />(https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c0/f2/f0/c0f2f0d1e573c91670a25457b8b8f789.jpg)<br /><br />https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2Fc0%2Ff2%2Ff0%2Fc0f2f0d1e573c91670a25457b8b8f789.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F125889752060012019%2F&amp;docid=wrmQ5kq5HrYHUM&amp;tbnid=oYJo1PAKgq268M%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwj3qJbwkoDbAhUNx1kKHdFlBDEQMwhNKA8wDw..i&amp;w=800&amp;h=911&amp;bih=947&amp;biw=1903&amp;q=two%20year%20old%20tree&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3qJbwkoDbAhUNx1kKHdFlBDEQMwhNKA8wDw&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8

				Those trees that the city plants grow faster. I have actually planted some trees in NYC and worked with Forestry in Queens. The tree planted has to have a 2in diameter at the base of the tree. The bigger trees cost more. They plant the tree that just meets that requirement.

				For the area to be maintained will involve merchants taking ownership of the immediate environs.&nbsp; Time will tell but it seems highly unlikely especially when one considers sanitation conditions on 74 and 73 streets.&nbsp; Particularly disheartening are the relatively newly installed tree surrounds which are filled with garbage/food,&nbsp; many of which are already knocked down.

				The whole light grey and dark grey concrete makes no sense. They should of made it all dark grey to hide the dirt and stains better. The tree pits have these weird trapezoidal shapes that will make installing tree guards difficult. The bird poop on the other side near the train is already impressive. That area will become dangerous to sit near because the bird poop contains air borne diseases. No bathrooms?

Several plazas in Manhattan, for instance, are managed and financed by the local Business Improvement District. That means that if your plaza&#039;s BID includes Macy&#039;s or the Flatiron Building and the surrounding real estate, your plazas are going to have a massive infusion of corporate capital aimed at beautifying that area to serve their business. It&#039;s not fair to compare Diversity Plaza to those. That does not mean that it cannot be an attractive place. It&#039;s just important to recognize that in a neighborhood like Jackson Heights, the capital improvements are going to be fairly standard fare -- how the plaza is programmed or maintained is up to you and me and any partners we choose to bring in.

We have to make this space for ourselves. 5 million seems like a lot to us but the way I see it is that the government is putting an investment in the area and they are going to want to see the investment pay off. We aren&#039;t going to see a ferris wheel anytime soon, or probably any furniture that is going to make a difference. You should make it your own in your own way.

				The dust is settling concerning the plaza.<br /><br />1. But are the trees, which are very important for the plaza, already struggling? Are there any experts on the forum who can comment?<br /><br />2. Ironically, the tall new development looming directly in the background actually creates a framework for the plaza, looking west.&nbsp; In other words, unexpectedly, it makes the plaza more aesthetically attractive to be in.&nbsp; And even might shade the area late in the day from the fierce summer sun. <br /><br />This is an inadvertent benefit of the high-rise.&nbsp; And completely unplanned and kind of, ironic.<br /><br />3. The blue umbrellas and bright chairs do help enliven the space. And it&#039;s being kept more-or-less clean.<br /><br />All-in-all,my conclusion now is that it&#039;s definitely a positive addition to the neighborhood. <br /><br />And seems to be very popular. <br /><br />Thank you to the city for the investment.

(BTW, I&#039;d have preferred <strong>free </strong>public toilets.) Until one or the other arrives, I&#039;d like to invite all to add to the emerging Diversity Plaza User Guide on the Jackson Heights wiki. One category there is toilets. See https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Diversity_Plaza. Be great to see both toilet locations and &quot;tricks&quot; to gain access: e.g., enter through the side door and make a quick right.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom

Obviously I have no problem with homeless people in general, but with the ones who continuously harass people and behave violently, I have a big problem.<br /><br />Before the redesign, there were certain homeless individuals who would harass me when I walked by (I&#039;m a woman), follow me down into the subway sometimes, scream at people walking by, and pass out on the stairs so no one could get into the subway entrance. Their behavior is scary and honestly, unwelcome.<br /><br />While the plaza was under construction, they disappeared and the homeless people who remained were pretty chill, the worst they did was pass out in the subway. But now that the plaza is back, so are the violent people who lived there before. In fact, I just saw the worst offender for the first time in months, drunk and barefoot and screaming in the plaza. So don&#039;t say that this isn&#039;t an issue, maybe you&#039;re a man and live without fear of random attacks, but I have seen them be violent before and now I have to change the subway entrance I use to go to work everyday. Very unfair and there is never any police presence nearby to keep things calm.

We need better treatment for them, but in the meantime, we shouldn&#039;t have to be afraid in our own community.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anecdotal, yes. But I have also been the recipient of threats and violence by unstable, mentally-crazed drug users.&nbsp; (Not in this neighborhood, let me add)...and I agree.&nbsp; Compassion was useless in that situation. A drug-crazed person can be dangerous to others.&nbsp; Ice and meth in particular can lead to incredible aggression in a person.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But this is world-wide first world problem.<br /><br />Definitely not just in Jackson Heights...<br /><br />And I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good enough reason for why we can&#039;t have nice things.&nbsp; Like a plaza.

In fact, it makes you seem privileged, because you live in your own little world where you don&#039;t have to be afraid to be randomly attacked on your way home from the subway. I once got out of the 73rd St subway entrance at 3 am and had to have the owner of a 24/7 bodega (I think it&#039;s gone now) walk me home because homeless people there were harassing me. So I&#039;m glad you don&#039;t have to worry for your safety or your kids&#039;.

				Not everyone reacts &quot;perfectly&quot; when they are caught off guard. I didn&#039;t call the police when one of those dudes harassed me. I just ran away and then got on the train and went to work. It was only later that I realized I should have made a call. I also once chased a mugger who pushed me to the ground and stole my purse (this was not in NYC). A getaway car pulled up and pointed a gun in my face. I would never have thought I would do something so stupid. It was instinct.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a woman, I&#039;m going to do whatever I need to do to feel safe. If that doesn&#039;t include stopping to call the police right away, so be it.&nbsp; I did call the time an old man was pleasuring himself while staring into my kitchen window (in Bklyn). They never even showed up.&nbsp; The only reason they took a report (two days later) was because my police captain father called to find out why they were ignoring me.

I see a hunhred things I’d like to report when i’m at that subway station, but unless I’m physically approached/harrassed or attacked I go on my way. Sad state of affairs when there is little or no police presence for an area with consistent problems.&nbsp; Better to use the Roosevelt ave entrance where there is usually a cop close by during rush hours.&nbsp; Btw, you cn still report it.

His penis was just out in broad daylight, and he walked right toward me, mumbling and holding it. I was so shocked that I just ran away, and if I had felt safer I would have taken a video and reported it to the police.<br /><br />This is absolutely traumatizing, especially to women, sexual assault survivors, and CHILDREN! This was at noon on a Saturday with people steadily coming in and out of the subway entrance. Something needs to be done, and every time I&#039;ve reported anything to police in this neighborhood it&#039;s never been taken seriously.<br /><br />I apologize if this deserves a separate thread, but please stay away from that subway entrance if possible. I know it&#039;s not right to have to inconvenience ourselves for one perv&#039;s gross behavior, but the police aren&#039;t doing anything to help.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ugh!

If women reported every man that exposed themselves in public, they&#039;d be talking to the police a whole lot. This is actually a regular occurrence in Jackson Heights (and everywhere in the city) that can be very traumatizing. In the past, I have reported this behavior to the police (even about THE SAME EXACT MAN who&#039;s been behaving erratically in Diversity Plaza for years) and seeing as he&#039;s still there all the time, exposing himself, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s helped any.<br /><br />I&#039;ve even had the police dismiss me outright and say that there was nothing they could do if he was no longer in the same spot when I went to report it. So please don&#039;t tell me that I need to report something that has never been taken seriously. You are the one who clearly doesn&#039;t want to help the community.

I didn&#039;t call the police when one of those dudes harassed me. I just ran away and then got on the train and went to work. It was only later that I realized I should have made a call. I also once chased a mugger who pushed me to the ground and stole my purse (this was not in NYC). A getaway car pulled up and pointed a gun in my face. I would never have thought I would do something so stupid. It was instinct.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a woman, I&#039;m going to do whatever I need to do to feel safe. If that doesn&#039;t include stopping to call the police right away, so be it.&nbsp; I did call the time an old man was pleasuring himself while staring into my kitchen window (in Bklyn). They never even showed up.&nbsp; The only reason they took a report (two days later) was because my police captain father called to find out why they were ignoring me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I&#039;m with you all the way on this. I can&#039;t count how many times I&#039;ve been harassed, groped, followed, etc. and haven&#039;t reported it. The police in general don&#039;t take this seriously (and I would be willing to talk to any of them that did) and these situations are often full of fear for women experiencing them. Sometimes the only thing you can think to do is run, or protect yourself, or whatever your instinct tells you.<br /><br />A blatant example I can think of is when there was a man who was taking upskirt photos and pics of women&#039;s butts in Jackson Heights and posting them on a Tumblr blog talking about the bodies of all these women in Jackson Heights. It was absolutely disgusting, and it was discussed on this forum. The police were notified and did nothing to find or stop this guy, who continued to photograph and film women in the neighborhood without consent and comment on their bodies inappropriately.

				It&#039;s true. There are plenty of disgusting jerks who have no problem whipping it out in public and urinating at any old hour of the day. Not to mention the exposure for harassment purposes. There are never any cops around when it happens. I&#039;ve seen it everywhere, especially in Jackson Heights, and there are certain areas I&#039;ve learned to just avoid.

				The best thing to come out of this improvement are the new sidewalks and curb cuts. In the winter these sidewalks will be easier to clean. The only low point is that at the Sterling bank corner they didn’t redo the sidewalk and install the new plastic red inserts. Also the walk and don’t walk signs are not aligned so people can see them across the street. 5 million and this wasn’t done? Shameful.

				Hi PizzaRat. You have a lot of thoughts about my posts. I have thoughts about yours. Please note, none of the below is an attack. You and others may not like my thoughts, but not liking my thoughts doesn&#039;t necessarily make them attacks.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lol, CaptainFlannel would&#039;ve liked me to give him a big old hug! </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Firstly, you and a few other posters really seem to be intentionally misunderstanding my posts about compassion for the mentally ill. I say intentionally misunderstanding because because I have clarified compassion for the mentally ill includes thoughts towards and words about the mentally ill, and outright mocking of my statements to suggest I am encouraging people to give hugs to people suffering from mental illness and are acting in a threatening way is unkind towards the mentally ill. I think the question for you and others to contemplate is why are you mocking the idea of showing compassion through words and thoughts in a neighborhood forum where it is likely some of your neighbors who actually suffer from mental illness (depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bi-polar depression) frequent and what impact do you think that might have on someone suffering from an already deeply stigmatized disorder?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wow! This is extremely insensitive. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sorry my question upset you, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s insensitive to ask if you reported criminal behavior to the authorities that are actually tasked with dealing with criminal behavior when you stated you would have done so if if you had taken a video. I&#039;m not sure why having a video would have made it worth it, while a phone call to the precinct without a video isn&#039;t. I don&#039;t think asking for clarification from you is unfair or unkind. <br /><br />Let&#039;s be clear, it&#039;s not like I asked a rape survivor why she didn&#039;t report her sexual assault.

I say intentionally misunderstanding because because I have clarified compassion for the mentally ill includes thoughts towards and words about the mentally ill, and outright mocking of my statements to suggest I am encouraging people to give hugs to people suffering from mental illness and are acting in a threatening way is unkind towards the mentally ill. I think the question for you and others to contemplate is why are you mocking the idea of showing compassion through words and thoughts in a neighborhood forum where it is likely some of your neighbors who actually suffer from mental illness (depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bi-polar depression) frequent and what impact do you think that might have on someone suffering from an already deeply stigmatized disorder?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Wow! This is extremely insensitive. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sorry my question upset you, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s insensitive to ask if you reported criminal behavior to the authorities that are actually tasked with dealing with criminal behavior when you stated you would have done so if if you had taken a video. I&#039;m not sure why having a video would have made it worth it, while a phone call to the precinct without a video isn&#039;t. I don&#039;t think asking for clarification from you is unfair or unkind. <br /><br />Let&#039;s be clear, it&#039;s not like I asked a rape survivor why she didn&#039;t report her sexual assault. And please note, talking to the police doesn&#039;t necessarily mean going up to the precinct to file a report.

I have clarified in my previous posts on this thread that I also believe that the mentally ill should have access to healthcare and help. I&#039;ve also stated that I too suffer from mental illness (depression &amp; anxiety). What I have a problem with is using &quot;you should show them compassion&quot; as an answer when I&#039;m complaining about individual people who behave violently and illegally. Your solution to the violent behavior of certain neighborhood individuals is to show them compassion, and I&#039;m not sure what that is going to accomplish.<br /><br />2. I explained in that same post that I have reported the same exact man&#039;s behavior to the local police before, and that they did nothing about it because he continues to hang out in the same exact spot with no police around. He is there nearly everyday.<br /><br />3. In no way did I make an assumption about your gender, actually. I simply said that women are faced with this kind of thing a lot. I also resent the fact that you&#039;re saying I exaggerate the frequency of things like public exposure. Whether you&#039;re a man or woman, that&#039;s sexist. I have no idea what your experience has been, but in my experience, I have been harrassed, catcalled, followed, and seen way too many people exposing themselves in this city. During some periods of time, those things HAVE been a daily occurrence. In fact, I just walked to the pharmacy in the neighborhood and had a guy catcall and follow me for a block before I told him off. However frequent this is, whether some women get it once a year or once a day, it happens way too often. Once is enough.<br /><br />4. I know the police did nothing because (if I&#039;m remembering correctly) the man continued updating his creepy blog for a long time afterwards, and I believe people on this forum discussed how they reported it to police but were dismissed. I did check the blog for updates for a while (because a picture of my ass had been posted on it, which terrified me), but don&#039;t even remember the name of it.<br /><br />5. My opinion of the police is based on my interactions with them. As I previously stated, I HAVE reported this type of thing to Jackson Heights police before, and seeing as there&#039;s STILL NO POLICE PRESENCE in the neighborhood, I have to assume that they don&#039;t take it any more seriously. When they actually show up and start posting police in the neighborhood to do something about crime here, then maybe I&#039;ll respect them more.

				Hi PizzaRat.

I don&#039;t think I have. Can you point to me where I did that? And if I did, I certainly apologize. But, I think I&#039;ve been specific that my criticism was directed at those who push the false narrative that the mentally are more likely to be violent criminals, and make people who are suffering from psychosis the butt of a snarky comment about a public plaza they don&#039;t like. Conflating that with a call to hugs for those who are exhibiting menacing behavior is rather unkind towards the mentally ill, wouldn&#039;t you agree?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the man continued updating his creepy blog for a long time afterwards, and I believe people on this forum discussed how they reported it to police but were dismissed.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This really isn&#039;t evidence the police did nothing. It&#039;s evidence they were unsuccessful. I&#039;m not saying the police definitely did something, but what I&#039;m saying is we shouldn&#039;t be so quick to indulge confirmation bias and believe the police don&#039;t care about public exposure, and consider other possibilities (not enough resources, previous unsuccessful attempts leading them to believe it&#039;s a waste of time, etc.) rather than settle on a certainty of belief that isn&#039;t warranted.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">they did nothing about it because he continues to hang out in the same exact spot with no police around.

Detain someone without due process? Keep an officer there permanently? What do you think the police should do?

				^^I really wouldn&#039;t be shocked that there were no families there during those times. School aged kids are in school in the afternoons, and usually having dinner/doing school work in the evenings.<br /><br />That being said, who actually expects families to spend time at Diversity Plaza? People with kids that need to be escorted to parks are looking for playgrounds. Young kids need a certain amount of physical activity daily for their physical development, and Diversity Plaza is not the place to go for that. It&#039;s a place to take a load off in a shopping area, and a spot near a transit hub where you can meet someone. I don&#039;t see a lack of families in Diversity Plaza as an indication of anything other than, well, that&#039;s not what it&#039;s designed for.
