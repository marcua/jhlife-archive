				75th Street between 37th Avenue &amp; 37th Road now has 2 bright <div>scrolling marquee</div> signs. Before this catches on as a trend can something be done to stop this?

				The Jackson Heights Beautification Group is meeting with Councilman Dromm next Wednesday to discuss this sign along with other commercial signage on residential and commercial buildings that have NEVER been inspected by the Department of Buildings, even though complaints have existed literally for years.&nbsp; We anticipate that our councilmember will have the DOB come out here to make sure they are inspected.&nbsp; Unfortunately, once one business gets away with this, all the others think it is open season to degrade our quality of life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please contact Councilmembers Dromm and Ferraras to express your concern about this issue.&nbsp; By the way, these LED, chaser-light signs are illegal in the historic district.&nbsp; They have also proliferated, and have been reported to the Landmarks Preservation Commission.<br /><br />Thank you for your concern!

				What is an LED chaser sign?<br /><br />We have a small LED sign in our office windows which has been there for years - long before the landmarking. Is this what you meant? Could it be grandfathered in as it was here prior to the landmarking status?<br /><br />thanks for the info

				the chaser signs are like &#039;zipper&#039; signs -- you know, like the news ones in times square, only in multicolors that flash and advertise. these are not in windows, but on the outside of buildings.<br /><br />http://www.alibaba.com/product-free/101472504/Pizza_LED_Sign_With_Flashing_Chaser.html<br /><br />

				I respect the rights of shopkeepers to install lights in their own storefront windows. But recently I have been irritated by the appearance of the lasers. :tickedoff: These are machines designed to be aimed at the ceiling or the floor, but not at an angle that would shine lasers into people&#039;s eyes. This can do some serious damage to the retina.<br /><br />The convenience store on the NE corner of 75th and 37th ave had one aimed horizontally into the intersection for a while, but lately it has gone away and now I am seeing it blinding people on 37th Road between 73rd and 74th St. I bet the one store owner sold it to the other. <br /><br />If it isn&#039;t illegal, it is at a minimum a lawsuit liability for the owner of any shop that installs one aimed horizonally out into the street.

				Lights, lasers, loud music and other things that cause distruption to quality of life (and health) should not be legal and therefore not allowed. We all - storekeeper and residents - need to copperate for a good community for all. ;D

				<br />Section dealing with lighting in the landmark rules.&nbsp; This is just one issue that is completly ignored by by the city in maintaining Jackson Heights as a historic district.<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/pubs/JH_English.pdf<br /><br />CHAPTER 8: PROPOSED ALTERATIONS AND NEW CONSTRUCTION<br />OF STOREFRONTS IN THE JACKSON HEIGHTS HISTORIC DISTRICT<br /><br />(7) Lighting.<br />8-12<br />(i) The installation of lighting conduits and fixtures shall not obscure or damage any significant architectural feature.<br />(ii) Lighting conduits shall be internal or not visible.<br />(iii) External light fixtures shall illuminate only the storefront and/or ground story signs.<br />(iv) The number and size of light fixtures shall be in keeping with the scale of the storefront.<br />(v) The design of light fixtures shall be utilitarian or shall complement the<br />architectural style and detail of the building.<br />(vi) Fluorescent and high intensity light shall be permitted only if the source of light is concealed and shielded.<br />(vii) Recessed light fixtures shall be mounted within the soffits of recessed storefront entrances.<br />(viii) No separate light fixture shall illuminate any sign with internal illumination.

				those are all great rules, ILHT, and it&#039;s hard to argue against them.<br /><br />one problem, though. i don&#039;t think that the block that started this discussion here is in the historic district. i don&#039;t have a great handle on the southern boundary, to be honest.<br /><br />anyone?

				Right nowthe Historic District stops on the east side of 77 street &amp; 37 Avenue. Anything on 37 Avenue below 77 Street is unprotected. The boarders included partial blocks above 77 Street between 37Avenue &amp; Roosevelt Avenue. The only place where it reaches Roosevelt is at 82 Street.
