				https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/new-yorkers-are-planning-a-citywide-clap-for-essential-workers-tonight-032720<br /><br />Excerpt from article: “In an uplifting display of support and gratitude, people across Europe and the U.K have been taking to their windows and balconies to clap and whistle in support of the healthcare workers.<br /><br />It&#039;s something we haven&#039;t seen here in the U.S., until now. Karla Otto, international public relations agency, is leading an initiative to bring it to New York City at 7pm tonight, using the hashtag #ClapBecauseWeCare.<br /><br />Karla Otto is asking people to give doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, grocery store workers, restaurant workers, truck drivers, sanitation workers, friends, neighbors and colleagues a two-minute round of applause for their essential work.<br /><br />If you need some inspiration, check out how it was done in London and Madrid:...”<br /><br />I can’t include the links to the videos, but it is pretty neat to hear the applause and not see any people. Would love to see it take off here too.

				I heard a lot of cheers as well -- seemed like a crowd of at least 100 cheering from my window.

Very happy to report some near me are doing it every night. Someone starts it off and then others join in. People bang pots, ring bells, cheer, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you or anyone wants to do it on their block, maybe others would be glad for the chance to join in as well.

				They really need it. Not just healthcare workers but thanks to the store clerks, restaurant owners, truck drivers and farmers keeping us fed, clothed and moving.

				We&#039;re an avenue away... Even cars are getting into it for the 2-3 minutes. I see my neighbors across the street going to the window as well :)
