				&quot;Make America Great Again&quot; is a simplistic slogan that sounds good but doesn&#039;t really clarify anything.<br /><br />Like <br /><br />&quot;Give peace a chance&quot;<br /><br />&quot;All you need is love&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the Morning&quot;<br /><br />These sorts of slogans are really lyrics that belong in songs.<br /><br />&quot;Make America Great Again&quot; could be a lyric in a perfectly nice, sentimental and nostalgic nationalistic anthem. <br /><br />It is not an axiom or vision by which a country can in truth really be governed.

				I grew up in the 50s. I was poor. I lived a block from the stock yards. I remember bums laying drunk in the streets. The high tax rates were in support of the US economy and jobs, to reconstruct from wartime to peacetime. My family home was taken by eminent domain to build a highway. Any benefits to poor people were gained indirectly. <br /><br />America WAS great because we were proud to be Americans. We conceived, implemented, fought for and won the American way: freedom, independence, opportunity. It&#039;s not a joke. Americans asked for and expected nothing. It&#039;s obvious that this spoiled generation, that thinks poverty is not being able to afford an iphone, will not learn from history or appreciate what previous generations gave us.

				The Evils of &quot;Socialism&quot;<br />Author Unknown<br /><br />This morning I was awakened by my alarm clock, powered by socialist electricity generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the US Department of Energy. I then took a shower in the socialist clean water provided by the municipal water utility. After that, I turned on the socialist radio to one of the FCC regulated channels to hear what the socialist National Weather Service of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration determined the weather was going to be like using socialist satellites designed, built, and launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I watched this while eating my breakfast of socialist US Department of Agriculture inspected food and taking the socialist drugs which have been determined as safe by the Food and Drug Administration.<br /><br />At the appropriate time, as kept accurate by the socialist National Institute of Standards and Technology and the US Naval Observatory, I get into my socialist National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved automobile and set out to work on the socialist roads build by the socialist local, state, and federal departments of transportation, possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality level determined by the socialist Environmental Protection Agency, using socialist legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve Bank. On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the socialist US Postal Service and drop the kids off at the socialist public school.<br /><br />If I get lost, I can use my socialist GPS navigation technology developed by the United States Department of Defense and made available to the public in 1996 by President Bill Clinton who issued a policy directive declaring socialist GPS to be a dual-use military/civilian system to be managed as a national socialist asset.<br /><br />After spending another day not being maimed or killed at work thanks to the socialist workplace regulations imposed by the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, enjoying another two meals which again do not kill me because of the socialist USDA, I drive my socialist NHTSA car back home on the socialist DOT roads, to my house which has not burned down in my absence because of the socialist state and local building codes and socialist fire marshal&#039;s inspection, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables thanks to the socialist local police department.<br /><br />I then get on my computer and use the socialist Internet which was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration and browse the socialist World Wide Web using my graphical web browser, both made possible by Al Gore&#039;s socialist High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991.<br /><br />I then post on freerepublic.com and Fox news forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine and energy - and especially for poor people looking for handouts! - is BAD because the government can&#039;t do anything right, and the poors don&#039;t deserve my hard earned cash that I got for myself without any socialist help.<br />

				Both millionaires who were born into wealthy families. Never forget that most of the JFK’s fortune was from his dad running rum from Canada and Cuba. He never paid taxes on that income because it was all illegal at the time. Most of the FDR wealth came prior to there being an income tax.

				Hate to break up the whole “I love Social Security “ love fest but given the decline in population after the baby boomers there will not be enough workers to cover the retirement costs of the elderly. It is only a matter of time before they will need to cut benefits or&nbsp; American workers will emigrate to seek a better life without legacy costs. It truly is a Ponzi scheme. Most twenty to forty year olds will never see a dime of social security they pay into.

				Well it seems the Republicans were right that the social security Ponzi scheme would end. The population demographics as mentioned above will take care of that. Unless you think today’s twentysomethings will pay 70% of their middle class paycheck to pay for all the elderly and disabled. The only out of this mess would involve immigration of highly educated people who earn high incomes. <br /><br />As for this “green deal” and Jackson Heights. Most of JH is made up of big buildings that burn gas or oil for heat and hot water. Electric heat would be prohibitively expensive and would burden the electrical grid. The power plants burn oil or gas depending on what is cheaper. Now they burn gas because of the low price of natural gas. If the rest of the nation prohibited fracking like NYS we would be burning oil. Most buildings in JH have boilers that can burn both depending on price. The whole solar and wind option is perfectly acceptable if you live in Southern California. So this whole “green new deal” is pie in the sky nonsense that will never actually solve our energy needs.

				Incomes haven’t been increasing if you factor inflation. Why would one expect that will happen given the increase in the cost of living? Even if you increase the salary cap there are too few people at those higher income levels to pay current amounts. This will require a dramatic decrease in benefits.

				Let’s all thank Mueller for his unbiased report on our President. Now, Mr. Trump can get back to doing what he has been doing all along since he’s been elected, and what he has promised to do. Bring back jobs? Yes. Lower unemployment? Yes. Building a strong economy after 8years of losses for our economy?? Yes Refusing to pay Iran billions of dollars for who knows what? Yes Deal with China,Syria,Iran,North Korea? Yes. Building the wall? Yes. Stop funding for Planned Parenthood and their abortions from my taxes??? Doubles yes.

				I believe it is time to accept that we, the people of the USA, elected Mr Trump.<br /><br />Not outside foreign influences, which is the excuse every third world country uses.

Let&#039;s see what we, the people of the USA, do.<br /><br />Also if 80% of our neighborhood is Democrat, that leaves 20% who aren&#039;t. Over 20,000 people who are our neighbors.&nbsp; That&#039;s actually a sizable number.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably time to accept that each and every one of our neighbors has a right to their political leanings without being &quot;hated&quot;.

And as you can see, have been doing so. The way to do it is by NOT INSULTING others. Even if insults are flung. Sticks and Stones etc. So, perhaps you might also refrain from &quot;middle school drama loving&quot; insults. Then you might also be free to exchange your ideas.&nbsp; <br /><br />Education is everything. And I now realize that learning how to exchange ideas on a forum is part of a person&#039;s education.

				&nbsp;Let’s go back to my original commentary of the day. I want to thank Mueller for the job that he did over the past two years and at a cost of $30 million to say that there was no collusion.

				my answer to your main question is &quot;any democrat aside from Joe Manchin or Tulsi Gabbard.&quot;<br /><br />but we still don&#039;t know what the Mueller report says. and, if the GOP has its way, we never will. because, apparently, Mitch McConnell doesn&#039;t want us to see the total innocence of the current administration.

				Jeanette <br /><br />The website realclimatescience is a cesspool of lies. it is created solely to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) about science that is settled. There is no controversy amongst people who actually study CC that it is real happening and manmade - and that it is an existential crisis for mankind. Any simplified headlines about floods don&#039;t take away from this fact.<br /><br />realclimatescience is founded by tony heller aka steven goddard, who is a paid for &quot;expert&quot;....by amongst other people, the heartland institute (part of a network of think tanks whose basic job it is to make fossil fuel investments&nbsp; safe for investors for a few more decades, at all our expenses....literally selling our children&#039;s future!). <br /><br />Except &quot;tony&quot; is not a climate scientist.....he is a retired software developer. He&#039;s not much of a scientist at all if you actually read his posts.<br /><br />https://tonyhellerakastevengoddard.com/who-is-tony-heller/<br /><br />-----<br /><br />People that promote this shit are literally dooming our earth. If you care about your kids and grandkids having a functional civilization and not dying in their millions due to flooded cities, low agricultural yields and countless other disasters....... rather than regurgitating&nbsp; propaganda from people who want to make money from oil companies before it all goes belly up..... use reputable sources.<br /><br /><strong>Answers to all your &quot;but what about the controversy&quot; are here:<br /></strong><br /><br />https://grist.org/series/skeptics/<br />&nbsp;<br />Any point &quot;tony&quot; can or has brung has been debunked above.

				<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">In a Functional Country, We Would Be on the Road to Impeachment<br /></span></strong><em>Mueller laid out the evidence for members of Congress to take action against President Trump. Will they?</em><br /><br /><strong><em>By Michelle Goldberg<br /></em></strong><br /><br />In 2017, a brilliant visual effects expert created a video montage called “It’s Mueller Time! Trump Administration Season Ending.” Set to the crooning of the 1963 song “From Russia With Love,” it shows F.B.I. agents rounding up the central figures who brought us Donald Trump’s presidency, culminating in Trump himself being led away with his hands behind his back.<br /><br />I’ll admit to having watched this over and over again; it’s one of the most satisfying bits of wish fulfillment I’ve ever seen. Wish fulfillment is all it was, though. It’s a national disgrace that Trump sleeps in the White House instead of a federal prison cell, but it has been a while since I had any expectation that the special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings, many of which were finally released to the public on Thursday, could set things right. Instead, I’d desperately hoped for something more modest: clarity. A rough public consensus on what happened in the 2016 election and its aftermath, akin to the Warren Commission report on the assassination of President John Kennedy, or the 9/11 Commission Report. A set of facts that serious people could agree on, leaving conspiracy theories at least somewhat marginalized.<br /><br />There are a lot of reasons Trump’s election remains a festering wound. It was a horrifying shock to many of us and, given his decisive loss in the popular vote, an insult to democracy. But there was also so much destabilizing weirdness surrounding it. Trump’s relationship with President Vladimir Putin of Russia has long been suspect; as Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who was the House majority leader at the time, told colleagues in a secretly recorded 2016 conversation, “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.” (He was speaking of Dana Rohrabacher, the slavishly pro-Putin former Republican congressman.)<br /><br />Several weeks before Trump was inaugurated, America’s intelligence agencies reported that Russia had engaged in cyberoperations to help him win. In the months that followed, there was one staggering revelation after another about secret conversations between Trump’s circle and various figures linked to Russian intelligence.<br /><br />At the same time, the new administration unleashed on the public a degrading cacophony of lies, of the sort many of us associate with authoritarian countries like Russia. The day after the new president was sworn in, Sean Spicer, Trump’s first press secretary, stood in the White House briefing room and insisted that the inauguration crowd had been unprecedented in size. This was terrifying, despite the petty stupidity of the untruth, because Americans were not yet used to being told to believe government diktats over the clear evidence of their senses.<br /><br />This quickly became our new normal. Once Republicans realized the power they could amass by collaborating in Trumpian mendacity, most of them gleefully abandoned any sense of epistemological solidarity with their fellow Americans. There’s a reason “gaslighting” has become one of the most overused terms of the Trump era. And perhaps the biggest lie of all was that Mueller’s investigation, rather than the events that precipitated it, was the real scandal, an attempt to frame Trump rather than an effort to get to the bottom of an assault on our democracy.<br /><br />It was probably naïve to think that Mueller could cut through such a thick web of falsity. But if anyone could have, it would have been him, the embodiment of a set of old-fashioned virtues that still ostensibly command bipartisan respect. Over the months of the investigation, he came to represent for many an ideal of manliness that rebuked Trump’s insecure machismo. He was a war hero, Trump was a shirker. He was a public servant, Trump a venal con man. He was honest, Trump a liar. America doesn’t have a Walter Cronkite anymore, a person whose word is trusted implicitly across the political spectrum. Mueller was as close as we were going to get.<br /><br />He and his team have now given us the clearest picture yet of the murky events surrounding Trump’s ascension. “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,” they wrote. The Trump campaign welcomed this interference, but, we now know, did not assist in it. “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” <br /><br />Once in office, Trump sought to thwart the investigation into what Russia had done. He believed — correctly, as it happens — that Russia’s actions cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory. The report says he may also have feared that what appears to be his advance notice of the WikiLeaks dumps of hacked Democratic emails and his campaign’s now infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian emissaries offering dirt on Hillary Clinton “could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.” Further, although “the President publicly stated during and after the election that he had no connection to Russia,” his company was negotiating to build a Trump Tower Moscow throughout most of the campaign, a fact that could have hurt him politically if it got out.<br /><br />Numerous commentators have said that the report reads like a road map for impeachment, and in a remotely functional country that’s what it would be. Mueller makes it clear that because of the Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, “we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.” Instead, the evidence is laid out for congressional action, or even for prosecutors to indict after Trump leaves office.<br /><br />The test for us now is how much evidence still matters. Before the report came out, William Barr, Trump’s attorney general, created a fog of disinformation around it, blatantly misleading the public about what it contained.<br /><br />Weeks before anyone else could read the report, he tried to close the door on obstruction, implying falsely that Mueller meant to leave the decision to him. In a news conference on Thursday, Barr repeatedly said that Mueller had found no “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller, however, never examined the case through the lens of “collusion,” which isn’t a term in criminal law: “In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of ‘collusion,’” the report says. Barr claimed that “evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.” The report is overstuffed with evidence of corrupt motives.<br /><br />But most people aren’t going to read the nearly 500-page report. Republicans have already seized on Barr’s words — and on the lack of criminal charges in a document that was never going to contain criminal charges — to claim total vindication for Trump. The president’s manifest disloyalty to the country in trying to halt an investigation into a foreign attack on an American election is, to the right, of no account. Nor are the counterintelligence implications of Mueller’s findings, which aren’t part of the report. In the eyes of the president’s supporters, his campaign did not participate in the criminal conspiracy that helped elect him, so no more needs to be said.<br /><br />The reaction to the report shows that between the minority of Americans who support Trump and the majority who do not, there may no longer be even the possibility of a shared sense of reality or national purpose. Even as exemplary a figure as Mueller cannot change that.<br /><br />Compounding the problem, Republicans are willing to act unilaterally on their perception of reality, but Democrats are not. As Hannah Arendt wrote in 1951, “Totalitarianism will not be satisfied to assert, in the face of contrary facts, that unemployment does not exist; it will abolish unemployment benefits as part of its propaganda.” The same logic underlies Republican threats to actualize fantasies about an attempted deep-state coup by opening an investigation into the Mueller investigation’s origins.<br /><br />Most Democrats, conversely, have facts on their side, but not conviction. They are reluctant to begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump because majorities, in polls, don’t support it, and there is no Republican buy-in. Whether or not this is politically wise, failing to impeach would be a grave abdication. If you want people to believe that the misdeeds enumerated in the Mueller report are serious, you have to act like it. To not even try to impeach Trump is to collaborate in the Trumpian fiction that he has done nothing impeachable. <br /><br />On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren took the lead among Democratic presidential candidates in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. Others should follow her. Mueller has given us the truth of what Trump has done, and in that sense the hokey faith the Resistance put in him was not misplaced. But right now only a political fight can make that truth matter.<br /><br />

				<br />Mostly provided by TIM DICKINSON<br /><br />HIGHER TAXES<br />Hikes for workers<br /><br />The $1.5 trillion GOP tax bill gives permanent cuts to corporations and millionaires. But the tax cuts for workers expire after just a few years. By 2027, 83 percent of tax benefits accrue to the top one percent, while Americans earning less than $75,000 – 86 million households in all – will face tax hikes.<br />Breaks for robots<br /><br />Trump billed his tax plan as a boon to workers: “Our plan can be simplified in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.” But the new law offers a deep tax cut for capital investments, creating a perverse incentive to replace workers with robots. If previously the cost of employing five people or investing in automation might have been equal, the tax break tips the economic scales to robots – and leaves workers holding pink slips.<br />Jobs sent overseas<br /><br />The Trump law taxes profits from American subsidiaries abroad at just 10.5 percent – half the rate for domestic corporate profits. That creates a powerful incentive to offshore factories and jobs.<br />LOWER WAGES<br />Overtime denied<br /><br />In 1975, 62 percent of salaried workers got mandatory overtime; today it’s just seven percent. A fast-food assistant manager making just $24,000 can be denied overtime pay. An Obama-era rule would have required overtime for anyone earning less than $48,000, boosting take-home pay for more than 4 million working-class Americans. But the rule’s 2016 implementation was blocked by a lawsuit. The Trump administration has refused to defend it in court.<br />Contract employees<br /><br />Trump ended Labor Department guidance that prevented many big corporations from classifying employees as “independent contractors.” The shift in status from employee to contractor will leave many workers without benefits – including unemployment insurance – and saddle them with self-employment taxes.<br />COSTLY LIVING<br />High housing costs<br /><br />In his first act as president, Trump blocked a rate cut on the federal insurance required for many mortgages. The move cost nearly 1 million American homeowners an average of $500 in 2017 alone.<br />Slashed deductions<br /><br />The Trump tax bill limits the deductibility of state property and income taxes to $10,000. In high-tax states like New Jersey, the yearly property-tax bill for a modest $400,000 home can easily top $10,000. That means middle-class workers will be subject to double taxation – long a Republican taboo – paying federal taxes on the money they used to pay off their state tax burden.<br />FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION<br />High investor fees<br /><br />Trump has blocked the “fiduciary rule” that would require many advisers to work in the financial interests of their clients, rather than maximize their own earnings through fees or juicy commissions. The rule would save mom-and-pop investors $17 billion a year.<br />Gutting consumers<br /><br />Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, now helms the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency conceived by now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Mulvaney is a fierce critic of CFPB, which he’s called a “sick, sad” joke, and he wasted no time in flipping CFPB’s mission statement, seeking now to identify and address “outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations” on business. In his short tenure, Mulvaney has blocked a crackdown on payday lenders and stalled CFPB’s probe of the massive data breach at Equifax.<br />No class action<br /><br />Trump signed legislation to overturn a ban on “forced arbitration.” This is a boon to bad financial actors like Wells Fargo, the bank that fraudulently opened accounts for thousands of its customers. Individuals seeking justice can now be forced into arbitration hearings, alone, against a giant corporation, and halted from banding together with others to sue in a class-action lawsuit.<br />Tax cuts for the rich<br /><br />Trump’s tax reform was supposed to ensure that “no corporation or individual, no matter how wealthy, is given an unfair advantage.” And he vowed to do away with the carried-interest loophole – a tax break for the wealthiest investors – insisting, “The hedge-fund guys are getting away with murder.” But Trump’s tax reform left the lucrative investor loophole untouched. The new law also created or expanded loopholes that will benefit the Trump family – including breaks for private-jet owners, real estate investors and heirs of the nation’s richest estates.<br />NO HEALTH CARE<br />Lost benefits<br /><br />The Trump tax bill ended the individual mandate to obtain health insurance under Obamacare. The mandate had spurred millions into plans that were highly subsidized – or free. Many lower-income working Americans, for example, do not realize they qualify for Medicaid. Without the push of the mandate, a projected 5 million Americans will drop off the Medicaid rolls, forgoing $179 billion in benefits. The tax bill will lead to 13 million Americans in all losing coverage.<br />Spiking premiums<br /><br />Ending the insurance mandate will lead fewer young, healthy Americans to enroll, leaving an older, sicker population in the Obamacare markets. This will drive a spike in premiums, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A separate Trump move – blocking reimbursements to insurers for mandated cost controls – has already caused the price of “silver”-tier plans to jump as much as 38 percent.<br /><br />DIPLOMA DEBT<br />Loan repayment<br /><br />Under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the administration has rolled back protections for students swindled by for-profit colleges. An Obama-era rule let student borrowers defrauded by for-profit colleges cancel their student-loan debt. DeVos is keeping the burden of proof on students to show that the college harmed them. She’s also moved to scratch an Obama-era regulation that forced for-profit colleges to demonstrate employment success for graduates or lose eligibility to accept federal loan dollars.<br />OPIOID CRISIS<br />Little done on drugs<br /><br />Trump made the deadly opioid scourge a focal point of his campaign, vowing to “dramatically expand access to treatment.” As president, Trump declared a national emergency on opioids – but made no moves on treatment, while placing an unqualified 24-year-old at a top post in the drug czar’s office. Trump championed GOP efforts to end the expansion of Medicaid, which funds addiction treatment for thousands. (It took more than a year, and the work of Democrats in the Senate, to appropriate $6 billion for the opioid fight.)<br />BURNING JOBS<br />Kneecapping solar<br /><br />In his first major trade offensive, Trump imposed a 30 percent import tax on solar panels. While doing little to ensure a future for U.S. solar-panel factories, the tax is projected to destroy 23,000 well-paid jobs among solar installers and the manufacturers of equipment needed to mount solar arrays and plug them into the grid.<br />Cruel cuts<br /><br />In his latest budget, Trump eliminates a rural-economic-development program, and cuts hundreds of millions of dollars from job retraining and programs for laid-off factory workers.<br />DANGEROUS WORKPLACES<br />Lax contracts<br /><br />Trump rolled back Obama’s “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” executive order. It had forced businesses seeking government work to disclose compliance with federal workplace-protection laws before getting a government contract.<br />Unsafe conditions<br /><br />The Trump administration has repeatedly favored corporate profits over human health. For the coal industry, the administration moved to weaken coal-dust standards, ended a rule to prevent mining waste from being dumped in streams and halted a study on the health impacts of mountaintop-removal mining. For Big Oil, Trump rolled back deep-water drilling protections designed to prevent another explosion like the one that killed and injured dozens on the Deepwater Horizon rig, and threatened to open drilling in coastal waters from California to Maine. ■<br />Sent from my iPad

Trump’s businesses were in far bleaker condition than was previously known.&quot;<br /></em><br /><br />By the time his master-of-the-universe memoir “Trump: The Art of the Deal” hit bookstores in 1987, Donald J. Trump was already in deep financial distress, losing tens of millions of dollars on troubled business deals, according to previously unrevealed figures from his federal income tax returns.<br /><br />Mr. Trump was propelled to the presidency, in part, by a self-spun narrative of business success and of setbacks triumphantly overcome. He has attributed his first run of reversals and bankruptcies to the recession that took hold in 1990. But 10 years of tax information obtained by The New York Times paints a different, and far bleaker, picture of his deal-making abilities and financial condition.<br /><br />The data — printouts from Mr. Trump’s official Internal Revenue Service tax transcripts, with the figures from his federal tax form, the 1040, for the years 1985 to 1994 — represents the fullest and most detailed look to date at the president’s taxes, information he has kept from public view. Though the information does not cover the tax years at the center of an escalating battle between the Trump administration and Congress, it traces the most tumultuous chapter in a long business career — an era of fevered acquisition and spectacular collapse.<br /><br />The numbers show that in 1985, Mr. Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his core businesses — largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings. They continued to lose money every year, totaling $1.17 billion in losses for the decade.

				you&#039;re correct -- it is hard to get passionate over Biden, who&#039;s the current front runner (like Jeb was at this point in 2015). he&#039;s not my top choice, nor is the other elderly gent on the D side...<br /><br />but every post-election analysis of the 2016 race refers to the number of people who voted for Donny because they hated Hillary Clinton with a passion, not because they liked him. i think enough people have that white-hot hatred for this incumbent to make a difference in 2020.

				IMO Mueller operates in a professional and diplomatic old fashioned way where everything he says is in the subtext.

That doesn&#039;t require interpretation.<br /><br />The White House is getting its message across clearly to most. <br /><br />Alas, the subtility of Mueller and his case confuses the public. It&#039;s as though Mueller is too fearful to say what he really thinks out loud.<br /><br />The White House is outmaneuvering Mueller to do with this investigation. The brazen approach seems to be what folks understand.<br /><br />

				i have to agree -- simplistic sloganeering is always more popular than thoughtful discourse. that&#039;s why dictatorial strongmen, from the right and from the left, manage to wrest and maintain power so readily. <br /><br />it&#039;s almost silly to counter shouted, monosyllabic lies with reasoned facts, but that seems to be the tack people are taking. it doesn&#039;t bode well.

				&quot;The debate has been clouded by the conflation of the phenomenon of concentration camps, which predate the Holocaust, and the death camps run by the Nazis&quot;<br /><br />https://www.jta.org/2019/06/18/united-states/the-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-concentration-camp-debate-explained<br /><br />Note the source. <br /><br />PS: I <strong>have</strong> visited Yad Vashem. Members of my family were killed in the Holocaust. <br /><br />So don&#039;t lecture me on what concentration camps are or are not. The racist dehumanizing poison that ran through the veins of nazis, at the moment, <em>in diluted form</em>, runs through the veins of dehumanizers - and apologists for dehumanizing people TODAY. Our job is to stop it concentrating and turn it back. <br /><br />&quot;Never again&quot; means for <em>anyone</em>, <strong>or it means nothing. </strong>

				Also it is all very well for childless folks to be blase about these issues. We are more likely to be immune to the allure of drugs. We can afford to be dismissive about it. Selfish, even.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — has become a definitional face for the party with a crucial group of swing voters.<br /><br />Why it matters: These Democrats are sounding the alarm that swing voters know and dislike socialism, warning it could cost them the House and the presidency. The poll is making the rounds of some of the most influential Democrats in America. <br /><br />&quot;If all voters hear about is AOC, it could put the [House] majority at risk,&quot; said a top Democrat who is involved in 2020 congressional races. &quot;She&#039;s getting all the news and defining everyone else’s races.&quot;<br />The poll — taken in May, before Speaker Pelosi&#039;s latest run-in with AOC and the three other liberal House freshmen known as &quot;The Squad&quot; — included 1,003 likely general-election voters who are white and have two years or less of college education.<br /><br />These are the &quot;white, non-college voters&quot; who embraced Donald Trump in 2016 but are needed by Democrats in swing House districts.<br />The group that took the poll shared the results with Axios on the condition that it not be named, because the group has to work with all parts of the party.<br />The findings:<br /><br />Ocasio-Cortez was recognized by 74% of voters in the poll; 22% had a favorable view.<br />Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — another member of The Squad — was recognized by 53% of the voters; 9% (not a typo) had a favorable view. <br />Socialism was viewed favorably by 18% of the voters and unfavorably by 69%.<br /><br />Capitalism was 56% favorable; 32% unfavorable.<br />&quot;Socialism is toxic to these voters,&quot; said the top Democrat.<br />Between the lines: Dems are performing better with these voters than in 2016 (although still not as well as in 2018). So party leaders will continue to try to define themselves around more mainstream members.<br /><br />The other side: Three members of The Squad — Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts — defended their approach while appearing in Philadelphia yesterday on a panel at the annual Netroots Nation conference, AP&#039;s Juana Summers reports:<br /><br />&quot;We never need to ask for permission or wait for an invitation to lead,&quot; Omar said, adding later that there&#039;s a &quot;constant struggle oftentimes with people who have power about sharing that power.&quot;<br />Go deeper:<br /><br />What you need to know about the 2020 presidential candidates, in under 500 words<br />2020 presidential election: Track which candidates are running

				Nothing new in Mueller&#039;s testimony.<br /><br />Which is what Mueller told us would happen.<br /><br />The whole thing, including the report itself, seems to have been an interesting exercise in futility.<br /><br />Folks simply don&#039;t seem to care enough.<br /><br />Much grumbling and that&#039;s it. <br /><br />Unlike in Puerto Rico where the people rose up to force the governor to resign. <br /><br />Now, that&#039;s an obvious case of folks caring.<br /><br />

Seeks Federal Loan in Biggest Deal in Decade, Sources Say<br /></strong>Lily Katz<br /><br />(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i3Mqq.4vdMRw/v0/-1x-1.jpg)<br />Kushner Family Pitches NJ Real Estate Development To Chinese Investors<br />Photographer: Spencer Platt/Getty Images<br /><br />Kushner Cos., the real estate firm owned by the family of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, has sought financing from federally-owned lenders for its biggest purchase in a decade.<br /><br />The company has been in talks with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about a loan for a $1.15 billion purchase of apartments in Maryland and Virginia, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction.<br /><br />Such a deal would increase Kushner Cos.’ exposure to government-backed mortgages at the same time its former chief executive officer is one of the most powerful people in the White House. Jared Kushner divested ownership in many of the company’s assets to close family members when he joined the government. Kushner Cos. had more than $500 million in loans from Fannie and Freddie at that time. Government-backed financing on this latest deal could more than double that figure.<br /><br />Spokesmen for both Fannie and Freddie said they had no information to share. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Jared Kushner’s attorney Abbe Lowell, said that Kushner has no involvement in the company’s management.<br /><br />‘Walled Off’<br /><br />“As part of an ethics agreement he has and has followed, Mr. Kushner has had no role in the Kushner Companies or its activities since joining the government over two years ago,” Mirijanian said. “He is walled off from any business or investment decisions and has no idea or knowledge of these activities.&quot;<br /><br />Laurent Morali, Kushner Cos.’ president, Emily Wolf, the company’s general counsel, and Karen Zabarsky, a company spokeswoman, didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.<br /><br />President Trump appointed Joseph Otting to oversee the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie. Otting previously served as CEO of OneWest Bank, founded by now-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, an ally of Kushner’s in the West Wing.<br /><br />Kushner Cos.’ latest deal is for 6,030 apartments across 16 properties in Maryland and Virginia from private equity firm Lone Star Funds, according to a representative for Michael Campbell of the Carlton Group, a real estate investment bank which is helping to arrange financing for the deal.<br /><br />Lenders’ Concerns<br /><br />Both lenders discussed funding the acquisition last year, according to people familiar with the matter.<br /><br />Even lenders that aren’t owned by the government have fretted about exposure to the White House. Executives at Deutsche Bank, the largest of the Trump Organization’s lenders, considered extending the terms of loans issued to the president’s company, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.<br /><br />Deutsche Bank Weighed Extending Trump Loans on Default Risk<br /><br />Officials at the German bank feared a public-relations nightmare would ensue if ever they found themselves in the position of having to collect on a sitting president. Government ethicists have raised similar concerns about Kushner Cos. and the federal agencies, for fear of the complications that could arise from refinancing or foreclosure scenarios.<br /><br />The purchase from Lone Star is the latest sign that Kushner Cos. is returning to its roots as an owner of suburban properties. It sold almost $2 billion of apartments in 2007 to help finance the purchase of 666 Fifth Ave. The company set a record with the $1.8 billion purchase of the 41-story Manhattan office tower, which was then plagued by outsized debt payments for more than a decade.<br /><br />Kushner Cos. reached a deal to sell a 99-year lease on 666 Fifth to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. last year, and has been pivoting back to the sprawling multifamily complexes that Charlie Kushner, Jared’s father, built his fortune on.<br /><br />In 2017, Kushner Cos. teamed up with Israel-based Psagot Investment House to buy Quail Ridge, a 1,032-unit complex in Plainsboro, New Jersey, that the Kushner family had owned until a 2007 sale. This past April, the firm bought the 360-unit Prospect Place in Hackensack, New Jersey.<br /><br />— With assistance by Patrick Clark, and Shahien Nasiripour<br /><br />Before it&#039;s here, it&#039;s on the Bloomberg Terminal.<br />

China has the vast economic power to start building super carriers with advanced fifth generation fighters. They are already violating freedom of navigation laws by claiming vast parts of the oceans as sovereign waters. They are also converting small sand bars into military bases.

Do you understand the difference between socialism and communism as stated by Marx and carried out since (i.e. in most of Western Europe.)? How are the universities promoting a &quot;communist agenda&quot; and what evidence do you have that they are doing so?<br /><br />My larger point is that there are people who love to call anything that they don&#039;t agree with as communist, socialist, fascist, anarchist (often conflating them as one and the same) but they don&#039;t fully understand what these labels imply. They are usually same people who try to claim that the NAZIs were socialist and hold on to the fact that the Democrats founded the KKK, but refuse to acknowledge the political shift that happened between the parties as a result of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965).

Twice I posted a YouTube video critical of the JusticeDems which demonstrates the intention to subvert our political and economic institutions.

				I believe that because we live in NYC, our view of the USA is far more diverse than the USA actually is.<br />From my research, <br /><br />Total population % of Latinx in the USA = 18%<br />Total population % of African-American in the USA = 12%<br /><br />I realize that living here our view of the USA is skewed (for the better, let me add)<br />but the hard numbers show that in its entirety the USA is mostly White. <br /><br />AOC is looking at the USA thro a Queens/Bronx lens. In which it appears that a great majority are Latinx etc...<br /><br />And that might be the flaw in her logic/viewpoint... when it comes to extrapolating to 100% of the whole USA population.<br /><br />I also think Trump possesses a similar flaw in his view of the USA since he&#039;s from New York. <br />Population % of Jews in the entire USA is 2.1%... Trump also apparently sees the USA thro a NYC lens. <br />

In which it appears that a great majority are Latinx etc...<br /><br />And that might be the flaw in her logic/viewpoint... when it comes to extrapolating to 100% of the whole USA population.<br /><br />I also think Trump possesses a similar flaw in his view of the USA since he&#039;s from New York. <br />Population % of Jews in the entire USA is 2.1%... Trump also apparently sees the USA thro a NYC lens.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Further thinking about this. This is the trouble with identity politics. It doesn&#039;t factor in that the identity of the majority of the USA&nbsp; is not so diverse. (Outside of NYC, that is.) And if Democrats like AOC set the game as identity politics, the rest of the USA will also play identity politics. White identity politics. And that&#039;s the majority in the USA. <br /><br />Thus identity politics is a losing strategy. From the get-go. (Outside of NYC)

Retail rents in JH are extremely high. Retail planners look at JH and see, statistically, a relatively impoverished neighborhood compared to much of the rest of NYC, because the co-op population is a minority in the area. The rents and the statistics that you get out of retail-planning GIS systems don&#039;t match up and so higher end chains don&#039;t come in. The result is that you mostly get local small businesses where the site planning is not happening hundreds of miles away in front of a computer screen, especially ones who have a personal, family, or ethnic relationship with the local landlords and so can argue for a break based on personal connections. Maybe an actual small-business owner, like Dudley, can comment further.

				Besides creating even more entrenched ugliness, which is pointless,&nbsp; I believe the whole impeachment process won&#039;t change a thing.<br /><br />The rules of the game were permanently upended by the President in 2016.<br /><br />The President doesn&#039;t care in the least that folks want him impeached.&nbsp; These issues are like water off a duck&#039;s back. <br /><br />Previous Presidents had a sense of &quot;shame&quot; or something like that.<br /><br />The new man in the top office doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />We need a unifying leader to emerge.&nbsp; And there ain&#039;t one.

				Sometimes I wish everything in Congress required a 2/3 majority.&nbsp; If a new law, bill, or rule isn&#039;t good enough to capture a supermajority then perhaps it&#039;s less beneficial or generally acceptable to the population than its proponents assume.&nbsp; This would also force both parties to compromise and work with each other or they will accomplish nothing, and hopefully then voted out of office.

				I believe there are some big things that require 60 votes in the Senate to pass, though I&#039;m not certain what the Senate rules are on that.&nbsp; Personally, I believe &quot;the rules&quot; in the House and the Senate need to be addressed.&nbsp; Seems to me the party in power is sometimes able to change or manipulate rules to suit their needs.&nbsp; Also, why does the Senate Majority Leader have so much power?&nbsp; Able to bring up votes on the floor.....or not.&nbsp; These rules need to be addressed with fairness, instead of power, leading the way.&nbsp;

				I have been watching some of the impeachment proceedings and it&#039;s becoming pretty obvious that something fishy happened. Some quid pro quo situation.<br /><br />However, one question lingers. Why on earth was Hunter Biden on a Ukrainian Gas Company board?<br /><br />The only reason I can imagine is an attempt by the company to influence his father, the Vice-President and thus US policy.<br /><br />I mean, no one has ever approached me to be on a Ukrainian Gas Company board and paid me $50K a month. I suppose my father needs to be elected Vice-President first. <br /><br />The only answer to the question I am posing about Hunter Biden is that &quot;no corruption was found&quot;. But the optics look very bad. Boards on companies exist to advise the organization. And who knows what conversations go on between a father and son @ Thanksgiving dinners etc?<br /><br />I always say two wrongs don&#039;t make a right.<br /><br />And, at the moment, my observation of the entire impeachment brouhaha is that two wrongs happened. One on each side...<br /><br />So I am looking forward to far more clarity concerning why Hunter Biden was on a Ukrainian Gas Board and paid $50K a month. Was he there for for his genius guidance? Or simply because of &quot;dear ol&#039; Dad&quot; and the chance to influence US policy..? <br /><br />I suppose we will hear more about this when the impeachment moves to the Senate. (And, I figure, gets defeated as the numbers aren&#039;t there to impeach.) <br /><br />So, in my mind, what I really see, currently, is that no side has squeaky clean hands in this messy matter of a Presidential impeachment. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

High crimes and misdemeanors, as the Constitutional framers intended, includes abuses of power that arise from holding office. It&#039;s been proven Trump abused his power. The facts aren&#039;t in question. The Senate Republicans aren&#039;t making the argument that what he did was peachy keen and a-okay. They&#039;ll vote against conviction not because Trump was acting appropriately. They&#039;ll vote against conviction with the argument that it doesn&#039;t rise to the level of removal from office. Didn&#039;t you read Lamar Alexander&#039;s statement?<br />

The House voted for impeachment, therefore he&#039;s been impeached. You should look up what that word means if you&#039;re going to keep using it. There are no witnesses because the Senate, which handled the trial that occurs once there has been an impeachment, voted against allowing witnesses. The Senate could not have done so had impeachment not occurred.<br /><br />Whether or not there was an actual personal gain is irrelevant, just like it&#039;s a ridiculous and wholly without merit defense to argue if a mugger pulls a gun on you but fails to get any money or items of value from you therefore no crime was committed against you. Being incompetent at abusing power doesn&#039;t mean we overlook the intent and effort to abuse power.

				Well...I suppose the one positive thing in this whole impeachment fiasco... is that by going after Biden, trying to dig up dirt there in Ukraine...Mr Trump was going after the wrong candidate. It was the wrong&nbsp; call. And really was a huge waste of time and energy for Mr Trump that blew up in his face. <br /><br />Biden is definitely not the Dem candidate who will face Mr Trump.

				There are lots of places in this country that are great for many different reasons.&nbsp; In fact they are great because they are NOT NYC, just as NYC is great because it is not them.<br /><br />Besides, I don&#039;t think the rest of the country wants to be New York, California, or Chicago (I&#039;m sure Jhx had a typo there).&nbsp; these places are ridiculed for all the right reasons.&nbsp; Because, despite their many good points, they also suck hard at other points.&nbsp; Ahh the duality of life.

				&nbsp; Feeling like Joe Biden is really the ticket here. He is a balm for most people in being reserved and thinking long term. The Tara Reade accusation is probably true as some kind of situation but I have doubts about the timing right now after he&#039;s been so public for so long and this seems meant to tip the scales. I still like Joe and think he&#039;s going to rally the troops. Trump&#039;s egoism has gotten to many of his supporters it seems. And giving Jared the car keys on so many issues has been profoundly stupid on his part with deadly consequences in the mismanagement of the PPE supply chain lately.

				Guidelines have been released today for the safe opening of religious organizations. They should be followed like any other business. They don’t allow many people to a liquor store or supermarket, they will do the same with the church. It is the first amendment. And I wouldn’t take one church in Arkansas to be the end-all for everything. Churches and mosques and synagogues must be reopened. And they are being opened today. If Long Island can open the bars, restaurants, and beaches, surely they can open a church. Under the safety guidelines.

				Benoit, I think many of us are as confused by you as you are with us. Every time trump does something insane, I think his devoted followers can&#039;t possibly continue to support him. But so many do, including you.<br /><br />For you and the few others on this forum that support him, I have the following questions.<br /><br />1) Why do you support trump?<br /><br />2) How have you benefited from his policies?<br /><br />3) Why do you live in Jackson Heights? <br /><br />It seems that the very nature of our neighborhood would go against what I <strong>imagine</strong> would appeal to a trump supporter. We are one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the city, and likely the country. We have immigrants, large LatinX and Asian communities, lots of LGBTQ people, and so many different languages spoken on our streets. The people of Jackson Heights are one of the many reasons that I love our neighborhood. trump&#039;s policies marginalize myself and so many of our neighbors which is why I find him so menacing and intolerable. As horrible as his first term has been, if reelected his second term would no doubt be worse for myself, our neighbors, our city, our country, and the world. I know you won&#039;t agree so I&#039;ll add a fourth question:<br /><br />4) How will a potential second term for trump benefit myself, our neighbors, our city, our country, and the world?<br /><br />You&#039;re obviously not going to change my opinion and I&#039;m obviously not going to change yours, but I am genuinely interested in your answers.

				<strong>&quot;America will never be a socialist country&quot;.</strong><br />It comes down to a president who has their country&#039;s interests at heart, or a president who willingly sells their country out.&nbsp; This has exactly 0% to do with where you live, who you have sex with, what your native language is, or how much melanin your skin produces.&nbsp; But I find discussion beyond that is rather pointless, as everyone is living in their own individual constructed realities in 2020.&nbsp; We can&#039;t even agree what is real and what isn&#039;t, let alone discuss the intricacies of one political viewpoint over another.

				Ben Ghazi isn’t insane? Monica Lewinsky isn’t it insane? Highest level of black unemployment is not insane? Wiretapping a political opponent isnt insane? Working with China behind Americas back, is not insane? The vice president son on the payroll of a Ukraine oil company? Making 50,000 a month. That’s not insane? Back handrailings with Iran? That’s not insane? Stagnant economy for 16 years? That’s not insane.&nbsp; And I can go on, and on, and on. There is a huge investigation and has been for the past couple of years about Hillary Clinton, and Obama. In September, you will know a lot more. She will testify. And Obama probably will be called also. Now that all this this declassification is coming out, you will all see what liars and crooks they are. Well you will not actually see it, because main stream fake news media will never show it. They are all behind Clinton. Huge donors. It all started because she wasn’t supposed to lose. And they will do anything to get him out of office. As will her followers. They hate trump so much, that they will do anything and say anything to take him down. From the collusion, to the quid pro quo, to the supreme court hearings, why I wouldnt be surprised if this whole flu was to take him out. Dr. Fauci was working at Wuhan on this exact virus five years ago. Without permission from this country.&nbsp; Do you know gates, Zuckerberg, CEO of Twitter, all huge donors to her. Which is why you only see the negative things about Trump, and nothing positive.&nbsp; Fortunately&nbsp; for us, his rallies are coming back, and that will stir the emotions once again. Let your man Biden hide in the basement. It’s much better for the country. And I can’t believe that is who you want to run the country. He cannot even say a sentence Without forgetting what he’s even talking about. Let him stay in the basement and sniff his wife and daughter. That’s where he belongs with the rest of the Democrats who are rallying behind him.I will always defend this country, and stand for the flag.&nbsp; Go ahead to defund the police, look at Cuba, they defunded the police. Same thing with Argentina. Doesn’t matter anyway, he will win by a landslide, and Clinton will be in prison. Along with her cronies and the whole Russian collusion delusion cohorts. Bailreform? How is that working out. Do you feel safe now?&nbsp; And your girl Catalina, she is saying that there is already too much police in Jackson Heights. I’ve seen many threads on this forum from people clamoring for more police presence from 78th St. and Roosevelt all along Roosevelt and look at Northern Boulevard. That’s where the Democrats are taking this country and that’s why I am for this president

				Benoit, is it fair to summarize your response to my first question (Why do you support trump?) as a general distrust of the Clintons, Obama, Biden and anyone associated with them? That seems like a fair response although I can&#039;t say I feel the same or agree with your assessment. I definitely think it is fair and necessary to question what the motivations of politicians are. Have you ever questioned trump&#039;s?<br /><br />Chingwa, It wasn&#039;t clear to me in your response who you support. Is it fair to say that you see this election as a choice between capitalism and socialism?<br /><br />And what about the remainder of my questions?:<br /><br />2) How have you benefited from his (trump&#039;s) policies?<br /><br />3) Why do you live in Jackson Heights?<br /><br />4) How will a potential second term for trump benefit myself, our neighbors, our city, our country, and the world?<br />

They use fear and anxiety to keep people watching. I find this as true of CNN as it is of Fox News. It&#039;s not a political thing, it&#039;s the business.

				I hope all you never Trumper’s in this group will take the time to watch the real news tonight during his rally. 70% of the fake news media is owned by anti-trumpers. The line already started last night for his rally in Tulsa. There were 1 million request for tickets to hear him&nbsp; speak. The truth needs to be spoken, and he is the only one speaking it. No need to make negative comments.Watch the rally, and then comment. And if you don’t watch the rally, then think about the syndrome. And think about the alternative to President Trump. Do you really want Joe Biden leading this country? Do you all hate trump so much that you would rather this&nbsp; country be run by a bunch of criminals with their own agenda that doesn’t include keeping America great?&nbsp; What’s happening in Seattle, without Trump, will happen across the country. Everybody on this site was all upset about the riots that were supposed to happen on 37th ave. Without Trump in charge, that will be an every day occurrence. That’s what the democrats wants. Riots, civil unrest, and defending the police. That is the agenda. And if you still believe in the Russian collusion delusion, you seriously have TDS.

				I am devoting some time and energy to get-out-the-vote drives in swing states and making modest contributions to Biden and some Democratic Senators. The local races here are a very low priority for me and I frankly don&#039;t even know whether there is any important reason to vote, other than some abstract civic duty and my interest in adding to the popular vote majority for Biden.&nbsp; I assume AOC is going to win. Are any of the local races contested or of vital importance? Are there ballot initiatives that are consequential? I can&#039;t find anything on line that gives people in JH a really good reason to vote, whereas if we lived in Georgia or South Carolina or Ohio, it would be obvious.
