				Besides the fresh bread I&#039;ve bought at Cannelle and the greenmarket, I&#039;ve just discovered a new favorite loaf. It&#039;s a seed and grain bread from the health food market. The label shows it comes from New Warsaw Bakery in Middle Village.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/zK93Z5P.jpg)<br /><br />Anyone have other favorites?

				Appetito, which is closing as soon as the owner (the blonde lady who&#039;s always there) can sell it, has some good ryes and coarse breads. Variety, up on Northern and 81st (80th?) has a decent Italian loaf, but I&#039;d love a warm, out of the oven, hero some days.<br />

				Hello! Kim Joseph here!<br />Many thanks to Ed and Shelby for the shout outs!<br />If anyone is looking for fresh sourdough bread, I&#039;m your bread woman!<br />Every week I bake 2 types of bread- plain multigrain and baker&#039;s choice (flavors according to whats in season and where my creativity takes me). I tend to lean more towards ancient grains and whole grains, so here is where you will find nourishing hearty whole grain crusty loaves, all baked after hours in the pizza oven at The Queensboro! <br />I am at the Queensboro on Thursday evenings from 5-8 pm for bread pick ups. Most of the bread is by order to avoid waste, but I do try to bake extras, which go quickly. <br />I take orders weekly until 5 pm on Tuesdays, because that is when I make the dough. <br />You can find my weekly bread and most up to date info on Instagram and Fb, and of course my website at https://www.littlewildbranchbakery.com/<br />You may also text me your orders at 347 553-7708<br />Wishing everyone a lovely weekend.<br />Warmly, <br />Kim Joseph<br />

				&nbsp;Kims bread is delicious. Sourdough stays fresh for so long and toasts very well. She adds interesting ingredients too if you<br />like variations and we have felt much healthier since eating her breads gut wise.<br />

				I like that seeded bread at Downtown - thanks for the recommendation, Shelby.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying Farine&#039;s foccaccia when they open. Not crazy about the greenmarket or the one they sometimes have at Foodtown. I&#039;ve been stocking up and freezing from Zabar&#039;s, which is delicious, but a bit of a trek!<br /><br />Planning to try some of the other suggestions too.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				lost bread is selling this really tasty -- but pretty pricey -- pretzel shortbread. sampled it a couple weeks ago and splurged today. salty/sweet squares, somewhere between dessert and drink accompaniment. they end up being about $1.25 each, but one is enough to satisfy. bag of eight.
