				Does anyone know what is being built at this location? The building seems to be commercial but if I recall correctly it&#039;s zoned R6.<br /><br />Also is anyone active with CB3? I called them about this but they never got back to me. Does anyone have any idea how active the Board is and what effect they have had on monitoring and shaping future development in JH?

				Good question. Searching by address (83-01 Roosevelt Ave) and block/lot # (1471/46) on the DOB website does not turn up any permits for a multi story building of any kind there. I&#039;m not sure how often the DOB updates this site, though there are some recent violations noted, just no permits that would suggest what is actually happening -- I see a demolition permit, a permit for a one story building to be repaired, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;d guess I&#039;m just not reading this right or the system is wildly backlogged. Maybe someone more familiar with the DOB can take a look? I&#039;ll try to walk by this week and see if I can get any more info from the posted permits...

				I thought the building behind the downtown platform on the 52nd Street station had a bad location as some apartments have totally obstructed&nbsp; views and one floor in the front of the building is only about 2 feet from the wall of the station platform, but this new building is really puzzling.<br /><br />This has to be one of the worst locations as it is right against the rear of the downtown platform.&nbsp; One apartment will have its window right against the station platform, removing any privacy!&nbsp; &nbsp;Whoever gets this one will always have to have their windows covered.&nbsp; The same for the apartment above it.&nbsp; The apartment below it will have its view obstructed by the track steel structure.<br /><br /><br />

				Hmm, half a year later and they seem to be stalled on this and the building is getting covered with graffiti. Anyone know what&#039;s going on?

				Hi guys! Anybody knows what the use will be for that new commercial-looking building on Roosevelt Ave and 83rd St? It looks like it&#039;s either gonna be offices or stores, or maybe a gym on one of the floors? Anybody has a clue?

				Anyone know what will become of this building?&nbsp; Looks like nice long island city-style glass-walled condos on the upper floors with two lowers floors of retail space.&nbsp; It&#039;s all empty right now though.&nbsp; Any info on this?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em>note: moderator merged similar threads -- at least I think you are all talking about the same building...</em>

				I spoke with the owner and toured the facility last week.<br /><br />The 3rd and 4th floors are residential, with 5 units on each floor, they are model after manhattan apartments<br /><br />One apartment on each floor has a manhattan view as well<br /><br />They are all 2 bedrooms, and are going for $1,700 a month<br /><br />The 2nd floor will be doctors offices<br /><br />The 1st floor after a lack of success with banking tenants, will be a Cell Phone Provider from the South.<br /><br /><br />I am also trying to get the parking reinstated for the area, as 8 spots are being lost because of construction zone signage
