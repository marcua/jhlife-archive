				No, they did not.&nbsp; Guess &quot;their&quot; dog didn&#039;t mean that much to them, that they wanted to get the cops involved.<br /><br />My husband was incredibly upset by this weird experience.&nbsp; If I am ever approached by these woman, I will immediately call the police.

				Sounds like a scam to steal the dog, or possibly distract your husband while one of them tried to pick his pocket ???

				i&#039;d bet on the latter. something similar happened to a friend of mine who lives in hell&#039;s kitchen, but she was also able to get away from the couple.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3517.msg23031.html#msg23031">Quote from: Aronan on October 23, 2009, 08:21:57 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sounds like a scam to steal the dog, or possibly distract your husband while one of them tried to pick his pocket ??? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				While we&#039;re talking about this particular nut-job of a woman and dogs, I think it&#039;s worth mentioning that I think it is <span class="bbc_u">very</span> risky to tie your dog outside of a neighborhood establishment and go inside if you can no longer see your dog once there.&nbsp; There are several dog-nappers in the city and there have been dogs stolen in the neighborhood. They especially like smaller, pure-bred dogs but they have also taken larger breeds.&nbsp; They will even take a mixed breed occasionally.&nbsp; Some take them for resale, some for ransom and others...who knows why.&nbsp; I know how broken-hearted I would be if I ever lost a pet so I want to remind people to be careful.

				Thanks to all who replied.&nbsp; My husband didn&#039;t describe the women to me.<br /><br />The suggestion that it might have been a scam where the two women were trying to distract him so they could steal his wallet makes sense.&nbsp; The other suggestion that they might have been trying steal makes sense too because he is an unusually good looking dog and we&#039;ve been stopped by people who offer to buy him or breed their dog with him.&nbsp; People are always asking &quot;how much did you pay for him&quot;.&nbsp; He is a rescue dog and he is absolutely priceless to us.&nbsp; My husband guards him his own life.<br /><br />We would never leave our dog unattended (tied-up outside a store) because 1) we would never take a chance with our dog&#039;s safety and security 2) it would upset him; 3) he would make a lot of noise because he&#039;s upset (which doesn&#039;t seem to bother some people but we have respect for others) .&nbsp; We walk him at a heel and don&#039;t talk on cell phones while doing it.&nbsp; The walk is about his well-being and spending some time together, especially after he&#039;s been alone while we&#039;re at work.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t seem to be a universal practice in JH either, as people let their dogs literally have &quot;free rein&quot; while they chat away on their phones.&nbsp; By the way, the law says that a dog can&#039;t have more than six feet of leash while you&#039;re walking him/her. <br /><br />New York Cityâ€™s Leash Law? According to Section 161.05 of the New York City Health Code, your dog has to be kept on a six-foot long leash when itâ€™s in a public place: <br /><br />&quot;A person who owns, possesses or controls a dog shall not permit it to be in any public place or in any open or unfenced area abutting on a public place unless the dog is effectively restrained by a leash or chain not more than six feet long.&quot;<br /><br />The dogs are all over the place.&nbsp; In any event, my two cents. (as I try to maneuver down the side walk without running into an unattended dog who wants to get into my dog&#039;s face. Enough, thanks for letting me blow off frustration.)<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that if people are motivated enough to be reading this blog they are motivated pet owners and respect their dog and others on the street.&nbsp; Take care of your dog, respect the neighborhood and your neighbors and JH will be a great place to live.&nbsp; And watch out for crazy/and or crooks whatever they are after.&nbsp; Thanks again.

				&nbsp;I hear so much of animals being treated as if they were accessories or commodities that it really warms my heart to know of people who treat their pets with the sensitivity and love that they deserve.&nbsp; Lucky doggie!&nbsp; :smitten:

				We consider ourselves a family.&nbsp; When we first got our dog he didn&#039;t know how to walk on a leash because he had just been chained up in a backyard. (or basement) When people adopt these beautiful dogs as puppies, they are not prepared for the work involved.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the leash, he pulled and jumped and ran all over the place.&nbsp; We worked with him and though it was tough at times, he&#039;s turned into the most loving sweet dog.&nbsp; He is a gift and we appreciate his devotion to us too.&nbsp; That is why this strange event was so upsetting to us, we couldn&#039;t imagine life w/o him now.<br /><br />thanks again.
