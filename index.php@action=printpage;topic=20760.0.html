				&nbsp;There is already one at the Bulova Park, near Home Depot, and it&#039;s great.

				I guess it took &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; to make soccer finally popular in the U.S.!&nbsp; ;D

				&nbsp;Have you ever been on Roosevelt Ave or 37th Ave when the South American Leagues are playing? Or in Astoria when Greece&#039;s team is competitive? Or in Woodside when the Ted Lasso&#039;s type leagues are playing? Flushing Meadows any day of the week playing lots of games next to the hulking tennis and baseball stadiums. Hiding in plain sight is one way to look at it. Seriously, go check out some games. Ted Lasso is such a fun show!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;As an immigrant community for decades, Queen&#039;s has an enormous soccer base. The US&nbsp; hasn&#039;t figured out how to monetize the sport yet but a number of professional athletes here have become owners of soccer clubs elsewhere. And not for nothing, moms seem to love their boys and girls playing soccer over many other choices now! Outdoors, lots of running, many different positions, frequent substitutions, lots of playfulness, less head injuries. We even drove past a boys on one side/girls across the street games in a rural farming area a few weeks ago that you would assume was football but no - soccer!

According to the link you posted, the project has been completed. The mini-pitch at Moser Playground is the only local project mentioned. The local CYO soccer teams have been very successful over the years and there are some men&#039;s leagues that have been playing in the schoolyards at IS 145 and Garden School. M Clancy also has had a successful Girls soccer team since they went co-ed, and Lexington School has a nice pitch. It would be nice if these facilities were available for soccer development programs, but insurance and legal considerations may make that unlikely. Nevertheless, soccer has been strong in the neighborhood for as long as I remember.
