				Chipotle has pioneered the improvement of fast food and is widely seen as one of the reasons that McDonalds is experiencing difficulties. <br /><br />Last week&#039;s Welcome Conference included talks by Steve Ells, CEO of Chipotle, as well as by Danny Meyer, Eleven Madison Park&#039;s Daniel Humm, the General Manager of Claridge&#039;s Hotel in London and others. <br /><br />There&#039;s a good summary of what Ells and others had to say here: http://www.eater.com/2015/6/15/8783757/highlights-from-the-second-annual-welcome-conference<br /><br />Probably the best message to come out of the conference was Danny Meyer&#039;s assertion that being right is less important than being generous. That idea will be part of staff training for the restaurant that I&#039;m opening this fall in Jackson Heights.

				I like Chipotle well enough...but I&#039;ve had two different jobs in the last 8 years in NYC in two very different neighborhoods in different boroughs. One thing that unites them is that Chipotle opened within a few blocks of my office in both locations. To me Chipotle is just another reminder that NYC neighborhoods are becoming increasingly similar. See the funny mashup image of corporate logos that someone posted in the Bruson building thread.

I wasn&#039;t bashing how they source their ingredients, I just didn&#039;t like the food. And I&#039;m not about to compare anything to &quot;black beans instead of blobs of brown stuff that is probably powdered crap&quot;. I assume you&#039;re referencing Taco Bell, which I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve eaten in at least 15 years, and wouldn&#039;t again unless I had no choice. It&#039;s pretty much Rosa Mexicano, Dos Caminos (I can&#039;t vouch for their food sourcing, but it tastes good). There&#039;s a great place in LIC called Casa Enrique which is just off the 7. Granted none of these are &quot;fast food&quot;, but I don&#039;t patron fast food much because it usually sucks. I&#039;m sure others could rattle off 5 times as many places we should patron before Chipotle.<br /><br />Again, maybe I just had them on an off day, but I was expecting it to be much better than it was after all the hype when I finally&nbsp; tried one. I would definitely go there before Taco Bell, there&#039;s no doubt about that.

				Re: Saltiness - I am extremely sensitive to salt.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat at the vast majority of indian places in JH for that reason - most of them are just too salty for my palate. But I eat at the chipotle next to my office once in a while and have never found it to be too salty for me, which is saying a lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />For fast food, it&#039;s a much better alternative than a lot of what else is out there. But don&#039;t do them a disservice by comparing them to an actual restaurant - that&#039;s not what they are nor is it what they are trying to be. I just wish they had some cilantro-free salsa.

				&nbsp;I think it&#039;s a fine addition to our neighborhood cuisine. It is welcome for people that need to customize their diets and <br />cannot eat the ingredients that some local restaurants use (tastily!) but may not disclose. I believe the use higher <br />quality&nbsp; meats and oils. Know lots of young people who eat here for the known healthy options and affordability.

				I wouldn&#039;t jump up and down for the opening of a new fast food joint, but I actually like Chipotle.&nbsp; I usually get the salad, which is essentially the same as the burrito just without the wrap.&nbsp; Tastes good, ingredients are locally sourced (they actually DO run out of things when they are not locally available, as they have in the past) and fewer chemicals.&nbsp; Just slightly more expensive than the rest of them, but tons better than McDonald&#039;s.

				Is anybody ever happy with what comes into the neighborhood? Lots of non chains, home cooking can involve tons of salt as well. You might want to add fat, sugar and the list goes on.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s definitely a step up from Taco Bell, and it involves fresh ingredients. <br />

				&nbsp;At a large meeting last week, (20+) we had Chipotle catering and it went over really well. Big step up from the previous<br />pizza and water cooler that this group usually has and it was surprising to see people new to this cuisine enjoy it so much.<br />They have a whole catering menu and packaging too at least at the one we used in Manhattan. Just make sure to add some<br />bowls as a number of people prefered to skip the flour tortillas. Not a local Mexican restaurant but possibly the next best<br />thing.

				First time EVER eating Chipotle and really enjoyed it.&nbsp; Love what they did to the inside and the food I thought was fresh and delicious. Nice addition to the hood.

				they are STINGY with the meat though, well with everything actually besides the lettuce...lol. It was the smallest burrito bowl I&#039;ve ever gotten at a Chipotle...was still hungry after. hope it was a one time thing. Would hate for them to become like Subway who became the stingiest fast food restaurant i have ever seen.

				the huge number of locations, the careless shipping and the all-natural product makes for a perfect storm. mcdonald&#039;s can ship pre-fabricated, embalmed patties of meat and other substances without risk of contamination. chipotle is more at risk sending around actual food in the same manner.

				Chipotle has done everything to correct the situation, yet it continues, one episode on the heels of the last. That&#039;s what seems odd.<br /><br />there are many opportunities for fecal material to enter the prep station: workers&#039; hands, the soil, water/ice, machinery and trucking.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />McDonalds uses fresh lettuce and toms too. Almost no food joints, even hi-end restaurants (where&#039;s Stew when you need him?) wash the veggies, or wash and protect them sufficiently. <br /><br />Chipotle is actually prepping non-&quot;embalmed&quot; meats alongside veggies? seems unlikely as they would have been cited a zillion times for that. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see how McDs&#039; &quot;embalmed&quot; meats could have protected their veggies for so many years with comparatively no e-coli problems. <br /><br />just a few more thoughts.
