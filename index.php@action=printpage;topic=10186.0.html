				so the scumbags who tried to beat the union and gave up before slinking away to sell their lease to Key Food went out with a sickening bang this morning -- shutting down overnight without telling employees anything.<br /><br />walked by this AM and saw a dozen or so workers standing outside talking, and saw a big CLOSED sign on the door. asked what happened, and one of the gentlemen told me the story of how they were not given even one day&#039;s notice, and, naturally, no severance.<br /><br />saw the d-bag manager leaning on a counter inside smiling, and flipped him the bird. if i&#039;d had a rock, i&#039;d have used it.<br /><br />the key food management had better at least talk to these unjustly fired workers or i will personally lead a boycott.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I agree, Chingwa. i&#039;m not sure what the ownership is. if, in fact, all the trade fair locations are owned by the same person/people, I sincerely hope they crash and burn one by one. or, if they&#039;re selling off, I hope they invest their cash in a next big thing that goes belly up in a hurry.

				Union reps on hand today leading a protest. The scumbag management told the workers &quot;you can always apply for jobs at the new store.&quot; No offers of help, just smirks as they walked away.

				http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131211/jackson-heights/trade-fair-supermarket-abruptly-closes-doors-tears-down-sign<br /><br />JACKSON HEIGHTS — A controversial Trade Fair supermarket abruptly and mysteriously closed its doors Tuesday, blocking workers from coming in and confusing shoppers who said they didn&#039;t receive any warning.<br />&nbsp;<br />Employees of the store on 37th Avenue between 76th and 75th streets came to work Tuesday morning but were not let in, according to a representative from the employees&#039; unions.<br />&nbsp;<br />And the red &quot;Trade Fair&quot; sign on top of the 24-hour store was torn down letter by letter that evening.<br />&nbsp;<br />Jack Caffey Jr., a director of the United Food and Commerical Workers Local 338, said the union wasn&#039;t given any information about the sudden closing. The workers were told to go home after arriving to work Monday night and Tuesday morning, he said.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;The store had no respect to tell their workers that they&#039;re closing the store,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s right before Christmas. It&#039;s right before the holidays.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />A man who answered the phone at the store said it would re-open Wednesday, but as of the morning it was still closed.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;We have some — we have a little problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#039;re doing inventory here.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Trade Fair&#039;s attorney, Frank Graziadei, said the store closed, but did not elaborate.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;All I can tell you is that the store closed,&quot; he told DNAinfo.<br />&nbsp;<br />Victor Fuentes, who identified himself as the manager, said Tuesday he had &quot;no comment&quot; on what was going on.<br />

				Wow that&#039;s despicable. At the protest did they ask people to take any action against the owners? I would definitely support a boycott and call the owners directly if possible. I would also contribute to a fund for the workers.

				As outrageous as this all seems, and as bad as I feel for the workers and their families, this is actually pretty standard practice across retail. The thinking behind it is that if workers are notified in advance that they will be losing their jobs, they will loot the store for goods and cash before departing. It is crappy that they were given no severance and/or a deal was not worked out with the new owner to keep them on, but the lack of notification is a reality of the industry.

				frankly, i think that these particular employees -- screwed over at every turn by an employer that refused to treat them fairly, threatened them for trying to unionize and on and on -- had every right to loot that place to the bare walls. hopefully, someone will find a way to take economic retribution on the former owners in some way, perhaps a legal one, perhaps not.

				If they had a union contract there should be a section pertaining to layoffs and reorganization. If they had that section MGMT is likely in violation of some aspect of the contract. Erica, that may be how the non- union private sector world works(sadly) but union workers have rights allotted to them through their contract.

				the owners locked out some workers for a long period some months back because of attempts to unionize. i stopped going there then, and declined to return when they reached a &#039;tentative&#039; settlement, but kept hanging posters accusing their workers of wrongdoing (not to mention having a goon on standby to threaten anyone with a camera).<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks for these articles. I am not happy with the way the transition has happened so far. Trade Fair has now been closed for a couple of weeks. The produce is still on the shelves, sure to be thrown out. Workers are out of work. In the meantime, we all are expected to crowd into the Met, which is already crowded and understocked. What gives?

				Why would the former owner leave food in his store?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t he own a bunch of other stores he could&#039;ve moved that stuff to?&nbsp; Did he do this on purpose?&nbsp; Rotting produce is not a nice welcome.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait til Key Food opens, not because I plan to shop there but so that it relieves the Met of overcrowding so I can shop there again.&nbsp;

				he probably figures that his insurance will cover his losses, which he&#039;ll inflate by whatever exponent. the entity that owned the place -- &quot;man&quot; doesn&#039;t seem to fit -- has no respect for anyone or anything. it&#039;s sad that he&#039;s able to crawl away with a profit.

I will say Trade Fair had a slightly divergent beer selection, the two of them together had a great beer selection between them. :P
