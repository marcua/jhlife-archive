				Now that school is in session, the poor elementary school students at PS 69 get to see an ever growing group of drunk men expose themselves while they urinate in the street . We must call 911 every day until these men get the hint that this is not tolerated.

				&nbsp;I walked by yesterday afternoon and thought the same thing. Somewhere I heard of an arrangement with those housing insecure folks that they can stay at night but during the day, particularly the school hours, they need to be in a different place. Maybe this is one way to approach the JH Post Office situation?

				There was a recent thread about the drunk men congregating on 37th Avenue, and 82nd street (in front of the old Burger King).&nbsp; &nbsp;The thread went on for months, and nothing was done about the men.&nbsp; I walk by the men every morning on 82nd street going to the subway.&nbsp; They are usually passed out, with bottles of vodka and beer cans strewn about, and rivulets of urine streaming down to the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got tired of calling 311 and nothing happening.&nbsp; &nbsp;Calls to local pols went unheeded.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Occasionally, some of the drunks will be carted off by the EMT, but they seem to flock back upon their release.

				Curious if is it legal to piss and and drunk in public.&nbsp; Not sure if these men fit the bill of housing insecure.&nbsp; Previously someone on this chat was upset by referring to these men as drunkards.&nbsp; Homeless I see in other neighborhoods do not seem to be the same brazen drunks that are congregating here in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It is a shame our community leaders are mum on this...

				The situation is horrifically sad. Just because something is “legal” or decriminalized (ie public urination), doesn’t make it right.<br /><br />I’ve lived in this neighborhood for 5 years and while we’ve always had some vagrancy, it’s never been this bad. Walking from 72nd street past the post office, up to 88th street, I must have encountered a dozen (at least) drunk men. One got in my face aggressively to ask for money, one was crawling by the 82nd street bust stop bc he was too drunk to stand. An older man was sprawled out unconscious, contorted in such a such a way, clutching a vodka bottle. <br /><br />These were only a few of the encounters just yesterday. It’s unacceptable.

The level of street litter and random drunk men pale in comparison to here.<br /><br />Actually come to think of it, Hudson Yards is as clean as a whistle. Soho and West Vill looked pretty great the last time I was there. Hmm…

We in Jackson Heights must face this challenge. And not dysfunctionally simply accept and live with it.<br /><br />It&#039;s much the same as having an alcoholic in the family. The entire family is affected...and the family, the non alcoholics, must bend to accommodate horrific behavior. Until that horrific behavior becomes the norm...and the family becomes twisted (and unhealthy) in its outlook. <br /><br />Again, it takes a stranger from the outside to see what those who have become blind can&#039;t.<br /><br />The only way to stop this shocking situation is for the liquor stores of Jackson Heights to stop selling alcohol to these substance abusers.<br /><br />The problem would be resolved in a New York minute.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I do hope you love it here as this is such a vibrant community...it&#039;s part of the reason that we moved here and why I am so fired up over this issue. <br /><br />Who to call has been a thorn in the side of all of us here who care about our beautiful streets. Some thoughts:<br />- Danny Dromm and Francisco Moya - but don&#039;t get your hopes up because these two have proven to be pretty useless<br />- 311: The more calls/complaints logged the better - it focuses the city&#039;s attention on this issue<br />- Community Board 3 - as I posted on the other (now locked) thread, other city community boards have been transparent about homeless outreach. Ours has not. <br />- 82nd Street BID<br />- 115th Precinct - for those that exhibit violent and/or lewd behavior. Hearing that they are exposing themselves to children makes my blood boil.<br />

				It’s a shame that we can’t have nice things in this neighborhood. Maybe the solution would be to remove the benches from in front of the post office . Or maybe we can flood the 115 precinct with calls to clear these men out . I live on 79th street and while there was always one or two vagrants on the benches , the number has gone up exponentially and quickly. The word is out that you can lay around and drink all day in front of the school without anyone hassling you. It’s a disgrace .<br />

I’m sure it can go on. But all these issues have essentially been addressed not over night but gradually. So I applaud you for killing the “CHARM!” in the neighborhood.

How do you know when Alphabet Person landed in Jackson Heights? Or are you making an assumption based on their history of posting on this forum?<br /><br />2. Why do you assume that people who have a problem with the men who congregate and drink themselves into oblivion daily, urinate and defecate on the sidewalk, make lewd comments to women and young girls, and occasionally expose themselves have a problem with these behaviors simply because these men are Latino? Have you entertained the possibility that these behaviors have serious implications for public health and safety, and that these behaviors are generally not tolerated in most societies?<br /><br />3. Why do you assume that the people who have a problem with the the fact that there are at least three of these groups of men between 78th Street and Junction are &quot;colonizers,&quot; which by the way, is a not so veiled euphemism?<br /><br />4. Considering No. 3, why do you assume that members Latin American and South Asian community do not have a problem with the presence of these men? How do you square this assumption with the fact that yesterday I saw one of these men start following a woman, who then started yelling at him in Spanish, drawing the attention of others on the street who also started yelling at the man in Spanish, one of whom I know quite well and has lived in this neighborhood for a long time?<br /><br />Look, I agree with you that the infiltration of national chains, and rising rents are a big problem for the neighborhood, but your logic on this particular issue is seriously flawed.<br /><br />To the person who asked what we should do, our elected officials are basically useless, but call them anyway. Also, make reports to 311.

				Why does no one blame the police, who are clearly dragging their feet? (instead of fighting each other.)<br /><br />I&#039;m born and raised here, and while some homelessness has always existed in the neighborhood, it has never been this bad. EVER. Trust me I&#039;ve seen bad, growing up up the block from the Adult ambulatory home on 80th and 45th ave, which is technically Elmhurst. <br /><br />There is a reason I bought my place in the Jackson Heights historic/landmark distract. It was nicer and cleaner, comparatively. And it pretty much always has been. So what has changed? When did these homeless drunks start congregating in large groups in multiple spots? (and this isn&#039;t even including the 3-4 individual homeless people who have decided 37th ave is a good place to be.)<br />When people started demanding accountability from the cops for their actions.&nbsp; <br /><br />And for the love of god, can people stop buying the homeless on 37th ave food. They are not going to go away when they know they are going to get a free meal. In fact word will get around that there are people in jackson heights who will offer to buy the homeless food. If you are feeling charitable, donate to a soup kitchen. <br /><br />

				The 115 precinct has surrendered. Last week I called 911 when I saw one of these men defecating in full view of PS 69. The one cop car that came an hour later came for a Starbucks run across the street . No one came to address the problem . The guy went right back to sleep on the concrete. We need to call 911 daily, not 311. We need to post on the NYPD 115 precinct page and call them directly . Maybe embarrassing them will make them react. If I was more tech savvy , I would upload a video of the drunks across from the elementary school and send it to the local news. The police and the politicians need to be embarrassed in order to finally do something. And BTW, I am a Hispanic immigrant and I don’t care if these men were any race, it is disgraceful to have to see this day in and day out.

				for better or worse, the government cannot simply grab people off the street -- even homeless people -- and force them into programs of any sort against their will. they can arrest them if they&#039;re committing egregious crimes, but not minor offenses.<br /><br />&nbsp;it&#039;s awful to see these guys harassing women (as they have been known to do), but if we&#039;re going to jail them for that, we also have to jail &quot;regular guys&quot; walking down the street for that same thing. that might be worth considering.
