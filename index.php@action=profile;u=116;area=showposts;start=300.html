					There&#039;s quite a lot that could be done to beautify that plaza and perhaps increase sales or foot traffic.&nbsp; There are only 4 big tables in the plaza, yet there&#039;s room for plenty smaller and nicer looking ones.&nbsp; Take a look at any of the many pedestrian plazas in Manhattan where they&#039;ve done an amazing job with the spaces.&nbsp; Take a look at the upcoming Queens Plaza greenspace.&nbsp; I am hoping that come this spring, the city would be willing to invest in planters, trees, chairs, tables, trashcans, and cleanup crew - to make it a more welcome, inviting place.&nbsp; The other night I did not see many trash cans at all, despite the volunteer crew that was said to come in this past weekend.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s increasing, but I&#039;m noticed a few more beggars hanging around the area of the plaza now. The plaza is not that inviting of a place with all the trash, lack of seating, and concrete barrenness.&nbsp; It&#039;s not someplace I would seek to hang out in - and I&#039;m clamoring for greenspace to even just sit down and read a book in.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has nothing - no greenspace at all.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it be wonderful if it did?&nbsp;

					Hey guys.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s already a thread on here about this but Astorians.com does.&nbsp; A very well dressed young gentleman got into my building twice and has been knocking on doors saying he&#039;s from Con Ed and asking for their bills.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not give him your bill.&nbsp; These guys are not from Con Ed nor are they authorized to do this.&nbsp; The trick is they&#039;ll say they&#039;re from Con Ed and are trying to help you save money.&nbsp; They&#039;ll ask you to sign something and in reality you are allowing them to switch you to another electric company and your bills will go up.&nbsp; This is a well documented scam and Con Ed is aware and has warned the public.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t open my door the first time around but he came again in the evening and I got mad.&nbsp; I opened the door and told him he needs to leave the building and stop conning people.&nbsp; I told him he&#039;s not from Con Ed and Con Ed did not authorize him to come.&nbsp; He tried retorting with a dumbstruck look but I shut the door in his face and told him to leave.&nbsp; Ugh, these people are such scum.&nbsp; He must be canvassing Jackson Heights - be warned.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thread on Astorians.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=21772.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=21772.0</a>

					I&#039;m glad someone brought this up.&nbsp; To my knowledge, Jackson Heights is severely lacking in green spaces.&nbsp; You have Travis Park where the greenmarket is, but it&#039;s just blacktop.&nbsp; Those in coops have nice gardens to sit in, but those of us in apartments have nowhere nice to go and sit.&nbsp; This pedestrian plaza is a nice idea but it&#039;s ugly.&nbsp; It&#039;s as if the city could care less what Jackson Heights gets.&nbsp; Here you have these nice green spaces in Manhattan set up with planters, trees, and nice tables and meanwhile, Jack Hts gets some leftover tables and no maintenance men.&nbsp; &nbsp;If they&#039;re going to bother setting up a plaza, we should at least get the same treatment Manhattan gets.&nbsp; I&#039;m not exactly surprised.&nbsp; At the same time, there are definitely people here with little respect for their neighborhood.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell you how many times I see dirty diapers just left in the street for people to walk over.&nbsp; I mean, come on!&nbsp; It&#039;s disgusting.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure if we did have a nice plaza that people would even care enough to respect it.&nbsp;

					Looks like the tower has moved on to another neighborhood.&nbsp; It was gone this evening and parking restored.

					Two weeks ago there was a burglary of a first floor apartment in my building just around the corner from 37th and 81st.&nbsp; I believe this happened during the day.&nbsp; The police stationed at 37th are not just in the tower but on the ground as well.&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s not going to stop all crime.&nbsp; But it can help.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen this tower in other areas as well.&nbsp; I agree it&#039;s probably on rotation.

					Thanks for letting us know.&nbsp; I pass that cart all the time.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be sure to steer far clear of the asshole.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it was up the night your friend was harassed, but there&#039;s a cop stationed at 37th and 81 street and I often see a few on the ground talking as well.&nbsp; She should definitely report this.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newbie here in Jack Hts and while I&#039;m still learning more about the area, I definitely get hit on a lot more here, followed home, catcalled, etc.&nbsp; It might be that I&#039;m female and Latina, who knows.&nbsp; And no, I don&#039;t dress provocatively.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter with these pervs.&nbsp; There are a fair amount of shops here with ridiculously proportioned mannequins and stripper clothing, as well as a fair amount of &quot;cabarets&quot; where you can pay girls to &quot;dance&quot; with you.&nbsp; Finding a &quot;massage&quot; isn&#039;t too hard either.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason I think of it as the red light district of NYC.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said, there&#039;s a lot to love about Jackson Heights and that&#039;s why I would stress the importance of reporting such harassment.&nbsp; We can avoid the guy, but he&#039;ll still be free to do it to the next girl.&nbsp; You do have a right to live without such harassment.&nbsp; Reporting the guy will help make Jack Hts a better place to live.

					I will listen to your advice, thanks!&nbsp; Glad to know it&#039;s not just my impression of Roosevelt - it really does remind me of Queensboro Plaza back in the day and the seedy Time Square before Disney hit it.&nbsp; So strange - it&#039;s just that one street and the rest of Jack Hts is quite nice looking.

					Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; Yeah, I&#039;ve learned to keep a low profile here, so as not to draw attention from anyone.&nbsp; As soon as I get off the train at Roosevelt after 10pm, I immediately leave that area and walk down 37th, keeping a low profile, but at the same time being completely aware of my surroundings.&nbsp; I get on the phone if necessary, and I have my keys at the ready.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do find Jackson Heights pretty on the side streets and on 34 and 35 aves - it&#039;s just Roosevelt that irks me, and I wish more bodegas or eateries would be open after 10/11pm on 37th.&nbsp; It would seem less desolate that way.

					I moved to Jackson Heights in June and I&#039;m still getting used to it here. &nbsp;After midnight, Roosevelt appears to become the red light district, the paddy wagons are out, &nbsp;and my boyfriend has been solicited by prostitutes on several occasions. &nbsp;After 10pm, &nbsp;37th Avenue closes down and not even a bodega appears open. &nbsp;It&#039;s pretty desolate. &nbsp;I&#039;ve been followed and harassed by drunken men on multiple occasions on 37th and the surrounding side streets, to the point where I fear for my safety when I walk home after 10pm. &nbsp;Having more of a police presence is a welcome thing for me. &nbsp;It won&#039;t stop everything, but it can help deter.&nbsp; I may not want to have to worry about crime but as a woman, it tends to come with the territory. &nbsp;I too wish for the day when a police presence isn&#039;t necessary.
