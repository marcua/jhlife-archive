				I went by there this afternoon to take a look. You can&#039;t see inside the store with paper on the windows and the gates down. But the exit door was clear. I stood at the door to look inside and a nervous looking guy was in there and spotted me. He just stood there with a look like &quot;what do you want here, go away.&quot;

				As much as I&#039;d like the new store to open, I am glad that the labor disputes need to be settled first. I am hoping that they will renovate the store as it was in bad shape, which does not appear to be happening at the moment. I also hope that the new store is open 24 hours like Trade Fair was and as some Key Food locations are.

				I&#039;d rather Key Food open sooner rather than later, so as to thin out the crowds at Foodtown. <br /><br />I do hope they rehire the workers from Trade Fair&#039;s meat department because they did a fantastic job. Although I don&#039;t understand why this is affecting Key Food. I would think this would be a dispute against Trade Fair and not Key Food.

				When I passed by this morning I noticed that there were fruits, vegetables, and other perishable goods being brought in. I&#039;m guessing this means they will open this week. It seems the store won&#039;t be renovated unfortunately, but hopefully it will be open 24 hrs.

				I stopped in Foodtown on my way home tonight - while waiting in the long line I noticed signs over the registers announcing new closing hours: Mon-Sat until midnight and Sun until 11:00. It looks like they will be giving Keyfood (or Global Market) some competition for the late night shoppers. <br /><br />I too have noticed increased prices at Foodtown since they changed from Met Foods.

				If the &quot;goons&quot; are the same as before, then presumably they are staff getting their jobs back.

				Well, these are still the Key Food people, Mr. Haque.<br /><br />The shame also is that the store does not bear the Key Food name, I know Key Food and they are a strict cooperative, now all my hopes are gone since this will be called Global Supermarket.<br /><br />I am displeased with his lack of effort to accommodate some workers as he promised, and intend to attend the rally tomorrow.<br /><br />My story about supermarket workers goes deep for me, as my mother was a supermarket cashier who was booted by new ownership of her store due to the fact that she refused to take a pay cut from $6.50 to the minimum wage of $4.00.<br /><br />But she was lucky in a sense, the previous owner heard of this and offered her a job at his main store, which unfortunately was too far to travel, and since she did not accept aided her in getting unemployment benefits from his corporation.&nbsp; This was a generous owner, and an excellent union, Local 1500.&nbsp; Ironically, this generous man was Gerald Mandell, who is one of the sons of the founder of Key Food.<br /><br />The displaced workers at Trade Fair were not as lucky as my mother.<br /><br />I truly am upset by the continued negative events happening at the former Trade Fair.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11126.msg54642.html#msg54642">Quote from: Beech Court on January 28, 2014, 06:24:57 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Beech Court <br /><br />Re: Trade Fair - 75st/37ave. to become Key Food <br />November 29, 2013, 02:17:12 AM <br /><br />I&#039;m hearing that there is no truth to this story and that Trade Fair is here to stay.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />erospolitico <br /><br />Re: Trade Fair - 75st/37ave. to become Key Food <br />November 30, 2013, 01:47:18 AM <br /><br />I am sorry to say that who ever told you that Trade Fair is here to stay is not being truthful.<br /><br />- There is an application for a new Grocery Beer License for the location - pending with the NYS Liquor Authority<br />(Please note: these applications require a bill of sale for a temporary license, and the lease transfer to issue a permanent)<br /><br />- I have spoken to the landlord&#039;s rep, and he confirmed it<br /><br />- Employees have acknowledged their transfer to another Trade Fair location, as the store is being sold<br /><br />- Tenants in the building where Trade Fair is located have been informed of the change by Trade Fair employees<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Well, Eros?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Other than taking a quick look inside, I haven&#039;t shopped at Global, but someone told me that they are only accepting credit card for purchases over $10.<br /><br />It&#039;s getting to the point of hilarity. The new supermarket is already a disaster because of the labor dispute, and it continues to do everything possible to make sure it never succeeds; first, by not hiring enough workers and now, this asinine credit card rule. They are essentially saying to the neighborhood that they don&#039;t want our business and want to fail. <br /><br />Foodtown is probably loving this. For the time being, it seems like it will always be crowded there.

				Good for Foodtown... I have always liked shopping there (they have the exact same staff still from when it was Met) and they are always friendly and smiling, everyone has bad days so I forgive the uncommon one-off which almost never happens.<br /><br />I never noticed the price-hiking people were saying was happening, not saying it isn&#039;t I just haven&#039;t noticed.

				Does anyone know what is happening with the labor dispute? I haven&#039;t seen protesters in awhile - any chance that management worked things out? I am desperate to stop shopping at Food Town.

				The situation at the trade fair - face it, it&#039;s still trade fair - has not changed. Protestors were, in fact, there at least three days this week, though they only had the giant rat twice. Thankfully, it seems nearly deserted inside
