				My building is undergoing a coop conversion and the prices they want are ridiculous. They are attempting to get historic district prices (even higher than that, actually) for a non-historic district building with no garden or parking.&nbsp; We were first given notice about this close to two years ago - including the &quot;insider&quot; price for our apartments. Now that they are getting closer to the actual conversion, we received updated prices for our apartments. Mine increased by $130,000. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Moderator note: This is a new thread created from splitting some posts from another thread. </em>

				i&#039;ve noticed a huge uptick in solicitation mailings from brokers with the standard &quot;if you&#039;re thinking of selling&quot; notes. a couple of the more aggressive ones have quoted prices that are off the chart -- even knowing that apartments in our building have certainly appreciated in value over the past couple of years.

				They have set up apartment C53 as the sales office. That&#039;s a renovated 2 BR 1 BA apartment with an outsider price of $567,800 (according to the black book). On the same floor, there&#039;s a renovated 3 BR 2 BA apartment that is priced at $929,050.<br /><br />The sign out front advertises &quot;Private Garden, Fitness Center, Stately P/T Attended Gatehouse.&quot; Which is quite a distortion. The central courtyard is nice--I love the fountains--but it&#039;s hardly private in the way that the historic buildings&#039; gardens are private; it&#039;s private because it&#039;s on private property. There&#039;s no fitness center yet, as far as I know, but when it does arrive, I&#039;m sure it will be in the basement. Prospective buyers: If you&#039;re imagining you&#039;d use the fitness center in the evening, you&#039;d better ask how late it&#039;s going to be open. (Currently the basement is locked down by 8:00 every night.) And I wouldn&#039;t deny that the gatehouse is stately, but if there&#039;s rarely anyone in it, it&#039;s not a big sales feature.

				Oh, and about that locked-down basement: If you use a wheelchair, you can only enter through the basement. So unless the basement hours are changed, you&#039;ll have a heck of a time getting in (or out) of the building after 8:00 p.m. <br /><br />If the managing agent and landlord are smart, they&#039;ll go ahead and change the hours and keep the basement open later. Otherwise they might get pesky questions about what made them start locking it down so early....

				The apartment C53 is a junior 4, the second bedroom is has entrances to the kitchen and to the living room and is quite small. $567.000 is probably 30-50% overpriced, as compared with another Junior 4 apartment that was sold within a block of Washington Plaza.<br /><br />When I lived in Washington Plaza for about one year and a half, in the beginning I always made the mistake of trying to use the basement entrance when I came back from work late at night.

				If these 2 BRs are newly renovated and the building is accepting 10% down, it would not be surprising for them to fetch $550-600. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the price on the 3 BR...but then again I don&#039;t know anybody who is looking in the $900K+ market in JH!

				They want $412K for my one-bedroom. That&#039;s the &quot;insider&quot; price.&nbsp; The outsider price is $456K, which is hilariously overpriced considering the state of the building and apartment (needs a lot of work). It faces 73rd and is extremely loud and we get tons of plane noise on the weekends the planes are routed over JH.&nbsp; The electricity sucks. The basement closing at 8pm is an annoyance.&nbsp; I like the idea of a fitness room!&nbsp; The garden is not private and there are no benches. <br /><br />The gut renos they are doing for the vacant apartments are in the 50-75K range. People who already live there won&#039;t get renovated apartments, and when you look at the prices, we aren&#039;t really getting an insider discount at all - new buyers are basically getting the same price with the cost of the reno tacked on. <br /><br />Simka - I never thought about the lack of wheelchair access after 8pm - that can&#039;t be ADA compliant. I&#039;m surprised that it&#039;s allowed. And it&#039;s such a pain not to be able to get to the laundry room at night.

				Lilybell, I read a few weeks ago here on JH&#039;s Life that the sponsor/owner has 62 empty apartments.&nbsp; Since none of these will sell at the outrageous asking price he can rent them at full market rent and sell sometime in the future.&nbsp; Considering your location being so close to the 74 street subway they&#039;ll rent quickly especially if they&#039;re renovated.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Alot of people will value the amenities, subway proximity, and already done renovations more than they would an old pre war apartment. Stratford Hall is a condo but it gets some outrageous prices for apartment&#039;s that look very average. I would be curious to see what the floorplans look like also. Are they are large open apartments?<br /><br />The Continental conversion in Elmhurst was fetching about half a million for 2 bedrooms, and over 300k for 1 bed&#039;s last year and JH certainly has more appeal than Elmhurst.<br /><br />starting so high gives them room to negotiate some also, but I could see them getting close to asking depending on the floorplans and how they renovated the apts and building.

				This same realtor, Nu Place Realty, handled the sponsor units that were sold in the Birchwood House in 2008. Same MO of slick advertising and office set up on site. Couldn&#039;t tell if they did the Continental in Elmhurst, but the sponsor was the same as the Birchwood.<br /><br />Nu-place sold dozens of apartments in the Birchwood in a month. The Continental also sold. These guys know what they&#039;re doing, so don&#039;t be surprised if they make a killing on this building also!

				Oh, look at this!<br /><br />&quot;The conversion of this pre-war Art Deco gem in Jackson Heights will bring spacious one- to three-bedroom apartments asking from $375,000 to the market. The conversion&#039;s selling points are its proximity to Manhattan (a 12 minute subway ride from Midtown), the building&#039;s architect Sylvan Bien who also designed The Carlyle Hotel, and private landscaped gardens for residents.&quot;<br />http://ny.curbed.com/maps/new-nyc-developments-for-sale-rent/washington-plaza<br /><br />I would <em>not</em> call Washington Plaza an Art Deco gem. It&#039;s got some nice period touches but isn&#039;t quintessential Deco style, like the great Deco buildings on the Grand Concourse. And unfortunately any Deco touches that ever existed inside the renovated apartments will be long gone by the time they&#039;re ready for sale.

				I presumed that the conversion was to a coop. If the plan was to convert to a condo, the sponsor can definitely get more money as more buyers would be willing to pay a higher price for a condo. Why wasn&#039;t the landlord converting to a condo?

So in a build after 1991 shouldn&#039;t have steps in to the lobby, or to the elevator, or a basement ramp with an incline that would be dangerous for wheelchair use and you should find doors that are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. But owners of older building can&#039;t be forced to bankrupt themselves retrofitting to be ADA compliant.

Same MO of slick advertising and office set up on site. Couldn&#039;t tell if they did the Continental in Elmhurst, but the sponsor was the same as the Birchwood.<br /><br />Nu-place sold dozens of apartments in the Birchwood in a month. The Continental also sold. These guys know what they&#039;re doing, so don&#039;t be surprised if they make a killing on this building also!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, Nu-place did sold out many of the Birchwood apartments in 2008. However Birchwood was a really nice building and sponsor owns most of these units. I think it&#039;s different story than Washington Plaza, where most of them still rent stabilized tenant. And buyers need to think about if they want to buy in a building that is mostly owner occupied or renters. It matters a lot when it&#039;s a co-op. Especially if the compelx has a hundred something units and they don&#039;t even own more then half of these units. However, if they are offering 10% downpayment and fully move in ready renovation. I think that&#039;s the catch people are willing to go for. It&#039;s not easy to save up 20% down payment with the recent sales prices plus a extra 50-60k cash side aside to renovate a unit. <br /><br />The same thing happen to Birchwood house, a studio apartment range from 187,500+. And that was 8 years ago&#039;s price. It&#039;s actually pretty expensive for a studio apartment. However it was renovated and required only 10% down and no board approval. <br /><br />

				I remember quite a few years ago looking at an apartment in WP.&nbsp; I know several people who live there and really like it.&nbsp; It is NOT Art Deco, but beautiful in its own right.&nbsp; I love passing and seeing the interior garden and water feature.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little oasis. It sure is close to the subway.&nbsp; You would certainly &quot;NOT&quot; see a city view from all floors and streets.&nbsp; This is true anywhere.&nbsp; If you go to LIC, they show spectacular waterfront views, but not every apartment has that. When they do, you can bet they are paying a premium for it.&nbsp; In WP, the fact remains that there are several apartments where the view of the Manhattan skyline is really great. Interior renderings are just that.&nbsp; They are renderings and so personal taste accounts for the pictures they are presenting. The apartment is the canvass and you can decorate as much or as little as you&#039;d like. I had always thought that this was already a coop. Did they attempt a conversion before? Whatever the case,&nbsp; you&#039;d be hard lucked to find an apartment with such square footage at a lower price and it is not out of line with what apartments are going for especially when one considers pricing in&nbsp; Brooklyn and Manhattan. Yes they are expensive. Yes, it is&nbsp; all an exaggeration, but that would be true in almost any conversion or &quot;sale&quot; as the object is to sell.

No, not that either! They have part-time gatehouse attendants, so during certain hours, someone is on-duty. But they don&#039;t sit at the window (as depicted); they&#039;re doing things, like monitoring camera feeds or delivering packages to residents or turning sprinklers on or off. Often there&#039;s a note on the gatehouse door saying &quot;In the lobbies&quot; or &quot;In the basement.&quot; And I have no problem with that, because I was never told the guys would be sitting there all the time and greeting residents and screening nonresidents.<br /><br />I guess the sponsor may be planning to increase the coverage of the gatehouse. If so, I hope that&#039;s already been allowed for in the maintenance, which is awfully high already.

				Hello LillyBell, the tenants association have an Attorney who wrote a letter to the sponsors Attorney explaining that if the tenants were given a 30% discount on their insider price, many would be interested in purchasing their units. This letter went out last week and so far we have not received a response. <br />Jackson Heights as you know is the next it place and very in demand because of its many subways lines and relatively quick commute to midtown. Prices have been going up in the nabe so if we can obtain our discount I believe it would be a good opportunity. If you want more info on the status of our negotiations e-mail me anytime.<br />Thanks <br />Raf

				The thing about renderings is that they are almost always out of touch with the current reality. Only a fool would think that every apartment is going to have a Manhattan view. Only a fool would think that every unit is going to match the rendering on a real estate listing for a new build or conversion. Renderings of new builds or new conversions is not terribly different from a model home. If one tours a model home and thinks the quartz counter tops, high end appliances, and hardwood floors aren&#039;t an upgrade, that person is either very naive and inexperienced, or the sales person did a fantastically horrible job at explaining what is standard and what is an upgrade. <br /><br />I just don&#039;t think the market is that foolish or naive or comprised of that many giant suckers by and large. I mean, these renderings are so obviously computer generated, I just don&#039;t see how a modern buyer could miss it.

				A rising real estate tide floats all boats, except the ones of people who can&#039;t afford rent or have to save up until they are 40 to buy their first property. Or the couple who is ready to upgrade to a two bedroom, but find they can no longer afford the neighborhood they spent the last seven years in a one bedroom as owners. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, as an owner I&#039;m thrilled my investment has appreciated considerably, and I&#039;m happy that New York real estate suggests the value won&#039;t decrease. But, I&#039;m not blind to the real problem of the lack of affordable housing in NYC. If we want the businesses and services that make our life nice - restaurants, hotels, schools, taxi drivers, etc. - there has to be a place for the employees of those businesses to live that doesn&#039;t involve a 60+ minute commute.

				I&#039;m sorry, but $250K for a one-bedroom in a post war building is not middle class prices. That&#039;s a $50K down payment plus money in the back afterwards. And that&#039;s this neighborhood, not shiny new condos in LIC. And it&#039;s also not something that someone earning $45K a year, and also paying back student loan debt, is going to have saved up before the age of 40.<br /><br />If we want to be a viable city, we have to actually have places for people earning $15/hour (or less) to live. Those people are the ones doing our laundry, preparing our food in restaurants, stocking the shelves at the stores we frequent, etc. And they aren&#039;t earning $45k a year, that&#039;s for sure.

				In NYC, about 70% rental units and 30% owner occupied units.&nbsp; There are some people, who can afford buying a coop but choose to rent by choice.

				I think it&#039;s less of an issue of can they afford to buy in NYC, but can they afford to live in NYC, period. <br /><br />Before most people buy, they have to rent, unless they are lucky enough to be able to live rent free with their parents. A rising tide raises all boats, except for the school teacher and cop earning $45k a year (and that&#039;s a typical starting salary for those solidly middle class professions), who have to shell out $1800 a month to rent a one-bedroom in Kew Gardens, that doesn&#039;t leave a lot left over to put in to savings to buy a down payment. And if one doesn&#039;t partner up, that person is almost guaranteed to be living with roommates well in to his or her 30s. Wages have been stagnant for decades, so the middle class actually isn&#039;t doing better than their parents and grandparents did a generation ago. The middle class is worse off.<br /><br />When it becomes impossible for the people who educate our children and serve us in law enforcement to afford living in the city, let alone the people prepping your food at the restaurants we frequent, it&#039;s apparent there&#039;s a problem. I don&#039;t have the answers, but affordable housing is a must. A city simply can&#039;t function if only the upper middle class and rich can afford to live in it. Someone has to clean the streets.

				I&#039;ll add to what abcdefghijk said.&nbsp; It&#039;s only a matter of time before we hit peak oil and raising energy cost will make living in a city with a well developed transit system even more desirable.<br /><br />The median household income of Brooklyn in 2000 was $31,315.&nbsp; In 2014, the income increased to $44,850, but when adjusted for inflation, the increase was negligible ($44,178 is the amount $31,315 becomes after inflation).&nbsp; So its not that there is more wealth in the borough, its just more inequitably distributed.&nbsp; That&#039;s an issue bigger than what they city can fully address.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its population increased by 130,000 people (5% of the whole borough), putting further pressure on a relatively static inventory.&nbsp; Supply and demand.<br />

				A lot of those luxury apartments are bought by overseas investors parking their (often shady) money, or by people that are new residents in the city, so don&#039;t do much to alleviate the short supply.<br /><br />The only way you could create more affordable housing in NYC would be to build tens of thousands (maybe a few hundred thousand) of new units. But NIMBYism is strong and current residents will oppose most such developments. This recent NYTimes article about San Francisco is interesting:<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html<br /><br />The Northern Boulevard corridor and Sunnyside Yards could likely support such a building boom.&nbsp; Would likely require massive rezoning so housing could be built on commercial space (i.e. all those crappy car dealerships). The M / R stations in that corridor are much less crowded than others in Queens and could support the increase.

What is being discussed is people who provide the services that you want in your city being able to afford to live in the city and how completely out of touch with reality it is to suggest they can just live in the suburbs (which they already can&#039;t afford) and commute a couple hours each day to serve the upper middle class and rich. Care to address that?

				^Comparing the riots in the suburbs of Paris to the 9/11 terrorist attack is profoundly ridiculous (and quite disrespectful to the people who lost loved ones in coordinated attacks that killed over 2000 people) Just stop. The suburban riots of Paris are tied to a number of things, two of which is economic disparity, and immigrant population that is discriminated against and feel marginalized. That you see this as a model for how cities should function speaks volumes. None of it is good.

				This, by the way, is what is being described as Paris working just fine. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/nothings-changed-10-years-after-french-riots-banlieues-remain-in-crisis (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/nothings-changed-10-years-after-french-riots-banlieues-remain-in-crisis):<br /><br /><em>More than 4.4 million people live in the toughest parts of the banlieues classed as priority zones, where, segregated along race and class lines, they face what Hollande has called “unbearable discrimination”. Grigny, a town of more than 27,000 people in Essonne, south of Paris, is at the sharp end. Three in five children live below the poverty line, unemployment – at 22% – is twice the national average, rising to more than 40% among young people. Almost 90% of the population live on two notorious estates: La Grande Borne, where a large refurbishment project is under way, and the high-rise “Grigny 2”, where private slum landlords have been taken to court for housing people in fetid conditions. Like in Clichy-sous-Bois, where the riots started, most feel that building renovation alone – though much needed – will not solve the problems of unemployment, education and the lack of a proper social mix on so-called ghetto estates.</em>

				We may have the same reputation, but it is categorically false to say that NYC has experienced the kinds of recent periodic riots fueled by economic disparity and racial discrimination that have occurred in the Parisian suburbs. <br /><br />If your argument about how awesome the city would be if we just had everyone who doesn&#039;t have money live in the suburbs (which are already expensive) and commute several hours a day for the privilege of serving you coffee at your favorite cafe relies upon falsehoods (e.g. It works just fine in Paris!

				The point of your posts are these:<br /><br /><em>I am confused as to why folks are worried about it. </em> -- You don&#039;t understand why people are concerned about affordability for the middle class and those who don&#039;t make enough money to be considered middle class<br /><br /><em>And folks with less money might be laughing and luxuriating in their space in the suburbs (living THE AMERICAN DREAM of a generation ago)...and scratching their heads as to why the middle class pays big for cramped conditions and less square footage in apartments... and hanging out in cafes.

				Well...getting back to Washington Plaza, I noticed that on the NuPlace site, all mentions of the &quot;gym&quot; are gone from the listings. I thought perhaps they were tired of fielding disappointed feedback from potential buyers who wanted to take a look at the facilities, and decided it was better to hold off on mentioning that particular amenity. But that probably isn&#039;t it, since the Washington Plaza site actually has a diagram of it.... <br />http://www.wplazanyc.com/wp-content/themes/washington-plaza/assets/img/amenities/fitness_center.jpg<br /><br />And it&#039;s got windows! That&#039;s a plus--not as claustrophobic as an interior basement room. Maybe it will even have direct access from the outside, so the closing time of the basement will be a moot point.

When I&#039;ve looked at apartments, I&#039;ve never compared median prices for entire boroughs; I&#039;ve compared prices in specific neighborhoods. Using median prices of any kind also disregards a lot of mitigating variables, such as the desirability of the neighborhood, whether a building is an established coop/condo or a conversion or new construction, what the maintenance charges are, etc. I might look at Jackson Heights because the prices are lower than neighborhoods I&#039;ve checked out in other parts of the city. But then, once I started looking here, I&#039;d compare the prices to other apartments here.<br /><br />We can debate whether the apartments are priced too high, but ultimately that will be answered by whether the sponsor gets those prices. It will be interesting to see.

Of course people who come to the building will see the reality. As I stated before, I&#039;m not saying anyone&#039;s being defrauded. It&#039;s just that personally (emphasize that &quot;personally&quot;), I wouldn&#039;t cotton to that kind of thing as a potential buyer--I&#039;d rather see something closer to reality. Have you been inside the buildings at Washington Plaza? Nothing here, except the garden with its fountains, bears a fraction of a resemblance to the slick renderings. So as a potential buyer, if I saw the renderings and then saw the reality, I would be a little suspicious--like, &quot;Is this place ever really going to look like they say it will?&quot;--but also I would just feel turned off because the fantasy they&#039;re presenting isn&#039;t even the kind of place I&#039;d want to live. <br /><br />It&#039;s been said here that fantasy renderings are done all the time. Well, not necessarily. They&#039;re done all the time for new construction. For buildings that already exist, and are converting, I don&#039;t know. Maybe it&#039;s done, but I haven&#039;t seen it. I have seen buildings with pictures of newly renovated empty apartments. And personally, I&#039;d rather see that.<br /><br />So, bottom line, it&#039;s not just that they&#039;re showing slick renderings that are far from the reality that surrounds me and others living here. It&#039;s also that because of my own turned-off reaction to them, it&#039;s hard for me to imagine them appealing to other people. Certainly my friends have reacted similarly, so I&#039;ve gotten some support. :D&nbsp; But hey, we don&#039;t like slick. We don&#039;t like seeing fake views out of windows. I&#039;m not saying there aren&#039;t people who do.

				^^I still don&#039;t see the issue. Renderings are just that. Renderings. It sounds as though the apartments being shown are renovated apartments based on the renderings. If someone feels tricked by the renderings, I think it sounds like that person is very naive. A conversion is similar to a new build when amenities are being added. Owners of new builds frequently have to wait longer than they expected to move in due to construction delays and once they move it it is not uncommon for amenities to come later. Again, if folks find that sort of thing as trickery, I would suspect they haven&#039;t spent much time looking at the market.

As I said, the way these apartments are being marketed is simply not my taste, and it&#039;s not the kind of approach that would appeal to me. <br /><br />

				Renderings aren&#039;t meant to reflect reality. If the intent was to reflect reality, the realtor would come take a photo of what is actually there. (And many, many photos, since not every unit can have a Manhattan view). It&#039;s just weird to register an objection to a rendering that is meant to depict *what is to come.* You don&#039;t buy a new build or conversion from a rental to a luxury coop based on what&#039;s currently in place. You buy based on what is to come. Until someone invents a time machine, renderings are how it&#039;s done.

There is. http://villagefeatures3d.com/blog/2014/6/9/why-graphical-renderings-help-sell-luxury-real-estate (http://villagefeatures3d.com/blog/2014/6/9/why-graphical-renderings-help-sell-luxury-real-estate)<br /><br />You&#039;ll have to talk to a realtor about why they don&#039;t include fantasy elements in to the tools they use to market their properties. My guess as a marketer in another space is that they are trying to give potential buyers a rendering that approaches what can be and will be accomplished with a space in order to facilitate sales. If renderings didn&#039;t help them sell, they wouldn&#039;t contract out with the firms that provide this service. In this instance the renderings seem to depict what has been done to the apartments being renovated or will be done to the ones that are under renovation, what will be done with the lobby and with other amenities, and including fantastical elements such as unicorns, Jetson style features, a mountain view, backing on to a golf course, etc. would be rather pointless and harmful to sales since potential buyers know unicorns don&#039;t exist, Jetson Style features don&#039;t exist, there are no mountains to provide a view in NYC, and there aren&#039;t any golf courses in Jackson Heights. If it doesn&#039;t help them sell or hurts their ability to sell, realtors aren&#039;t going to do it.<br /><br />The whole business plan for the developer it to get as many apartments sold at top dollar as quickly as possible for top price. They aren&#039;t going to wait until everything is 100% complete before showing the apartments and property. Renderings aid them and the realtors they have hired in showing potential buyers what is to come and help sell units in a new build or conversion before the renovation is complete. Developers like that.<br /><br />Renderings are common in the luxury market.

Maybe you&#039;re imagining that they&#039;re going to do a complete overhaul of all common areas to make them match the renderings? Replace all of the elevators and the building entrances? If they do, and if they install a full-time doorman, it may <em>approach</em> luxurious. Of course, the shareholders will find their maintenance going up even higher if that happens.<br />

				So, what we&#039;ve established here is that a rental conversion to a luxury building isn&#039;t often the norm. And because of that you&nbsp; (Simka) aren&#039;t familiar with the use of renderings, because you don&#039;t look at listings for luxury conversions very often. That means the criticism of use of renderings is moot.<br /><br />Now, you guys can disagree whether or not the building will be up to &quot;luxury&quot; standards.

Even the new build hallways aren&#039;t anything to brag about. Industrial carpets and modern light fixtures, and walls with only one layer of paint. Wow, how luxurious. <br /><br />FYI, the website does not claim it&#039;s a five minute commute to Manhattan. It claims a 12 minute commute. That&#039;s a pretty hopeful regular commute from 74th Street, but it&#039;s actually a reality on the best days.<br /><br />Honestly, it sounds to me like you guys are just bothered by the first big harbinger of gentrification for the coop market in Jackson Heights.

				It&#039;s almost like you think Simka there&#039;s some industry standard on what &quot;luxury&quot; means. There isn&#039;t. Or that Nu-Place has defined what &quot;luxury&quot; means to them. They haven&#039;t. They&#039;ve simply used the term in their marketing copy. The word &quot;organic&quot; is probably better defined. It&#039;s for the market to decide if the apartments and building meet the market&#039;s understanding of what a luxury pre-war building should offer. That will be decided by how successful the realtors are in selling the units for asking price or above. Stayed tuned.<br /><br />Luxury is by definition, as it&#039;s being used here, a marketing term. Claiming a 5 minute commute to Manhattan when that&#039;s impossible isn&#039;t &quot;marketing&quot; it&#039;s deceptive. Because it&#039;s a lie. Just like rendering in a golf course backing up to the building would be a lie. Calling a pre-war building, with high end finishes in newly renovated apartments, with nice appliances, crown molding, high end cabinetry, a gatehouse, renovated common areas, and a fitness center a luxury building isn&#039;t a lie. That&#039;s pretty much what the market expects for a luxury pre-war building. That you Simka expect differently suggests to me you might not be that familiar with many pre-war buildings that market themselves as &quot;luxury.&quot; (Note, new &quot;luxury&quot; builds have different standards. Sure the market demands high end finishes, nice appliances, etc., but the standards for size are different, and modern conveniences like a washer/dryer in the unit, in-unit temperature control are expected).<br /><br />Where I do think what the market expects in a pre-war luxury building and what the floor plans of the available apartments show don&#039;t match up might be the smallest units currently shown on the site. The floor plans show an 8 X 13 bedroom with one closet. That strikes me as a rather small bedroom for a one bedroom. The dining room looks a little small to me too, and kind of seems like an extension of the foyer. My guess is it would make a fine office space and to shift the dining area to space right by the kitchen with small wall left intact.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=14641.msg70679#msg70679">Quote from: Simka on May 02, 2016, 12:31:15 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I know you&#039;ve proven yourself immune to understanding this, but to me, that approach is laughable <strong>and misleading</strong>....But by patiently hanging in there and refusing to accept that I found the listings hilarious...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What part of your description of the marketing of this building as misleading and getting responses from me disagreeing with your stated assessment of the building do you find so hard to understand?No kidding you find it &quot;hilarious.&quot; You also have stated it&#039;s &quot;misleading.&quot; Synonyms for &quot;misleading&quot; would include deceptive.

And I doubt that any of the floors have been redone since the occupants moved in. These discrepancies should add up to a discount of way more than 10 percent.<br /><br />A 900+-square-foot apartment that&#039;s being sold as a one bedroom goes for way less than a 1,000-square-foot one bedroom that&#039;s been reconfigured to have a small second bedroom.

				@Simka - FYI, that XKCD comic applies to you as well. <br /><br />Someone reminded me recently that the early buyers in a new build often have a harder time getting a mortgage since there is a lower owner occupancy rate, and when they get one, higher rates. Which is why it&#039;s not uncommon for early buyers to get a discounted price. (I assume that applies to conversions as well.) <br /><br />I&#039;m unclear how long the units on the market have been available. At some point though if they aren&#039;t moving, renters who want to buy their units may be able negotiate a further reduction in the insider&#039;s price. If the developer has misjudged how hot the Jackson Heights market is, getting current renters transformed to owners will make selling the renovated apartments at asking or above easier. Of course, inventory in Jackson Heights is kind of low too right now, so if there is a pent up demand for apartments, renters hoping to play chicken with developer on price could lose.

				No need to give me the benefit of the doubt Simka, as I&#039;ll tell you I did see your response.<br /><br />The thing about renderings is that no one really expects them to convey the beauty of oak floorings, or to look like anything more than simulations. (The renderings are done before the apartments are finished being renovated because the developer has a strong financial incentive to get units sold quickly). It&#039;s not the uncanny valley, but renderings look like, well renderings. Even the ones that simply place furniture in an empty room for an online listing look fake. Nobody would object to a 3D model in the sales office, and base their objection on it not looking like reality. It&#039;s not supposed to. Renderings are a digital tool in the same way a model is, that aids in online marketing, And with the flood of real estate porn on HGTV people are pretty familiar with.<br /><br />There&#039;s a one-bedroom in Dunnolly Gardens that I think has been on the market for over a year. I get periodic notifications about open houses. What it doesn&#039;t have is any photos of the actual apartment. I can&#039;t help but wonder if renderings would do any good (assuming the place it a total wreck and that were acknowledged in the MLSLI listing.)

				Keep telling yourself that @Simka.<br /><br />How does the maintenance compare to Carlton House? The amenities on the website for the building says gatehouse personnel at key hours, which means it won&#039;t have 24-hour staff. That sounds similar to Carlton House, which has a part-time doorman. If I recall correctly, the maintenance always seems kind of high at Carlton House, which I&#039;ve attributed in part at least to paying the salary of the doormen.

The ones that are closer in price tend to be tiny (I see so many 750 sf 2-bedrooms for sale in Bklyn in the 600K range) or in need of updating.

				Yes, I moved here three years ago, and at that time I was looking for a large one-bedroom/small two-bedroom for $250K-$300K. They existed, but I wasn&#039;t in a big hurry since I was tuckered out from selling my coop and moving and I had a one-year lease on my apartment. I continued looking but didn&#039;t find anything I liked enough to make me want to move, since I liked my apartment at Washington Plaza (and also had pretty specific wants re coops). Well, prices have steadily moved upward since then. What was in my price range then is in the high $300s to mid-$400s now.

				I think realtors are looking to position JH as the next Park Slope. A couple years ago Sunnyside was getting lots of attention as the next big neighborhood. Prices went up. 15 years ago Astoria saw a jump in prices, as it became a popular destination for young professionals working in mid-town. Prices went up. We&#039;re coop-ville here versus a larger stock of one, two, and three family homes in Astoria, Sunnyside, or Woodside, so I see the appeal (and in fact, that was one of many reasons I decided to buy in the neighborhood).

				I don&#039;t think the market for JH is in Park Slope. (Except for maybe renters there who have hung on to the same rent stabilized apartment for the last 15 years.)&nbsp; Brooklyn has been a thing for a long time, but now that more and more of it has been gentrified, people are turning to Queens. And let&#039;s face it, Queens isn&#039;t known for its beautiful architecture. JH is actually quite a physically attractive neighborhood.

				Nu-Place Realty seems to achieve excellent results with its PR.&nbsp; They even managed to get several paragraphs (!) in an article about Elmhurst in the NY Times this week in a &quot;Living In&quot; article: NY Times: Elmhurst, Queens, a ‘Crossroads of the World’ (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/realestate/elmhurst-queens-a-crossroads-of-the-world.html?mabReward=CTM&amp;src=rechp&amp;WT.nav=RecEngine&amp;module=Slide&amp;region=SlideShowTopBar&amp;version=SlideCard-10&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Real%20Estate&amp;slideshowTitle=Living%20in%20Elmhurst%2C%20Queens&amp;currentSlide=10&amp;entrySlide=1&amp;pgtype=imageslideshow)<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>&quot;</strong></span>According to the 2013 edition of “The Newest New Yorkers,” published by the New York City Department of City Planning, in the period 2007 to 2011, 71 percent of Elmhurst’s residents, or 77,100 people, were foreign-born. But brokers said newcomers from Manhattan, brownstone Brooklyn and Forest Hills, Queens, were also trickling into Elmhurst, drawn to its low-rise, lights-out-early streets, lower housing costs and proximity to the subway.<br /><br />Among them are Jenny Oliver, a 31-year-old physician assistant, and her husband, Gareth Oliver, 35, who works in finance in Midtown Manhattan. The couple had a baby last year and were outgrowing their one-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side, which cost $3,500 a month. They were also paying $500 a month to park their car.<br /><br />In November, the Olivers moved into a gut-renovated, two-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot co-op in the Continental Park on 51st Avenue in Elmhurst, paying $452,000. Common charges are $950 a month, and they park free on the street.<br /><br />“Before we put an offer in, we came out and walked around at night and on the weekend, and found a lot of families, and liked the diversity,” Ms. Oliver said. “In Manhattan, everything we saw was so tiny and so expensive.” She was also delighted to discover Elmhurst Park, on Grand Avenue, where 9-month-old Jake can play.<br /><br />Yael Goldman, an associate broker with Nu-Place Realty, said her company had sold almost 60 apartments in the last year in the 153-unit Continental Park. Developers had bought 79 sponsor units in the 1962 co-op and overhauled them while modernizing common areas; the renovated apartments went on the market in 2014.<br /><br />“People who are priced out of Brooklyn and Manhattan and looking for an urban feel are coming to Sunnyside and Woodside, and now farther east is catching up,” Ms. Goldman said. “There’s great food of all kinds and shopping nearby, and they’re seeing it as hip.”<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>&quot;</strong></span>

I continued looking but didn&#039;t find anything I liked enough to make me want to move, since I liked my apartment at Washington Plaza (and also had pretty specific wants re coops). Well, prices have steadily moved upward since then. What was in my price range then is in the high $300s to mid-$400s now.

				I think the only way JH is going to gentrify is if something drastic happens to lower commercial rents. And I don&#039;t see that happening unless there&#039;s a major demographic shift in our neighborhood which makes South Asian business owners no longer want to open up here.

				Gentrification may not be the right word for this neighborhood. JH around the historic district seems solidly middle to upper-middle class. (At least for coops.) Whatever word you choose though, property values are going up. <br /><br />When I came to the neighborhood two years ago, a one bedroom apartment was within the price range I was comfortable with. Now the asking prices are higher than I would have been comfortable with, and comparable to the prices I was seeing in Sunnyside two years ago, when I decided to look outside of that neighborhood.

This is not just a theory; it&#039;s what I was told directly from the lender and he showed me documentation to prove it. They are providing conventional fixed-rate mortgages at a very competitive rate - I&#039;m already pre-approved and I&#039;m not planning to pay 100% cash for an apartment. <br /><br />The complex will reach the 50% sold benchmark at about the same time that they reach the &quot;15% bona fide purchaser&quot; benchmark (the 192 units are used for that calculation - they will reach it at 26 units. There are a few rent controlled units that don&#039;t count towards the goal).<br /><br />Part of me wonders if the owner is going to completely blow off our group request and not even bother to reply to it within the 90-day time frame. I think she&#039;s confident she can hit the necessary percentages without us. She is under no obligation to reply to our request if she&#039;s not interested in negotiating with us. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if she has an investor or two ready to snap up the rent-stabilized units that aren&#039;t purchased by the tenants and doesn&#039;t give a crap if any of us buy or not.&nbsp; Obviously, we would have a lot more leverage if the 192 figure was used for the 50% benchmark. <br /><br />There are now 6 listed as in contract but there are at least three more sales that I know of that aren&#039;t shown on the website.

You seem very enthusiastic about the building now, even though in the beginning of this thread you said it was overpriced. You said: &quot;My building is undergoing a coop conversion and the prices they want are ridiculous. They are attempting to get historic district prices (even higher than that, actually) for a non-historic district building with no garden or parking.&quot; <br /><br />Now, you are quick to spread rumors about how many apartments you think are sold and seem to act as a cheerleader for the owners. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Latest figures posted: There are 14 &quot;executed agreements&quot; for bona fide outside buyers to purchase coops at Washington Plaza. So far there are 0 executed agreements for tenants to buy any. (I wonder if a tenant buying a different apartment is counted as a non-tenant? I imagine so....) I think 14 is about half of the 15 percent necessary for the coop plan to be declared effective.

				Hi Simka,<br /><br />You are right - they are only counting tenants who purchase their own apartments as &quot;tenants&quot;.&nbsp; So if a tenant buys a renovated unit instead, they will be treated like everyone else and have to put 20% down (instead of 10%) and pay two month&#039;s maintenance at closing (instead of one). <br /><br />There must have been a flurry of activity after the 90 days were up - I ran into the sales agent putting up signs saying that they extended the sales office hours on the 90th day; I am so curious as to how many tenants made offers.

				Apt #C51 is such a beautiful apartment. However I think the maintenance is a bit too high at $1787 in compare to most of the three bedrooms co-op in JH. With a listing prices at $935k. A 20% downpayment will be $187,000. And that’s not including closing cost yet.&nbsp; With the current mortgage rate at close to 3.5 for 30 years. Added the maintenance. Your monthly payment will be $5146 PER MONTH. And if you are lucky enough to saved up to 30% downpayment which is $280,500. Your monthly payment will be reduce to $4690 PER MONTH. However you still want to have a little bit saving left after you shell out almost close $300k of downpayment. I have to say who ever move in to those three bedroom apartments in WP has to have a really high income, or dual income, or even saved up a lot a lot money. Paying five thousand something a month just to live seems like a lot. Even you do pay down 50% of downpayment at $467,500 (which is a lot money o save).&nbsp; Your monthly payment will still be $3860. A little better now consider people are paying $3200 for one bedroom rental in Williamsburg.&nbsp; But it’s still a lot. Just my thought.

				The super mentioned that quite a few tenants disappeared in the middle of the night after not being able to pay rent when they were taken out of preferential rent. The guy next to me was one of them. <br /><br />The owner is going to hit her numbers any day now - they are up to 17 in contract and 8 or 9 more are about to be signed.&nbsp; <br /><br />simka, are you sure about the drywall/plaster?&nbsp; Aren&#039;t they only re-framing internal walls that are moving?&nbsp; The apartment next to me was renovated and I did an experiment - I blasted my tv and then snuck into the apartment next door and put my ear up next to the wall near my tv on the other side and I could barely hear it. And I had it on really loud; much louder than I would ever play it normally. <br /><br />edited: I live in one of the lines where the dining area is becoming a second bedroom (I think there are at least two lines doing it, not just one like mentioned in the article).&nbsp; It makes sense for my apartment because it&#039;s a one-bedroom that is over 1100 square feet.&nbsp; The rooms are ridiculously large - I can fit three 9x12 rugs in my living room/foyer.&nbsp; The bedroom was only made a tiny bit smaller in order to enlarge the bathroom a bit. I&#039;ve seen the new floor plan in person and it&#039;s still pretty spacious as a two-bedroom.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought when they wrote about preserving the space and original grandeur that they meant things like the moldings and archways, which they&#039;ve pretty much kept in all of the renovations.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad they didn&#039;t chop the 1-bedrooms into 2-bedrooms.&nbsp; If you look in Brooklyn, you see tons of &quot;two-bedrooms&quot; for sale that are 700 sf converted 1-bedrooms and I&#039;m grateful they didn&#039;t go in that direction. <br /><br />The courtyard is looking so pretty lately! <br />

				You can count on pretty much anything in the Real Estate section to be a puff piece. It&#039;s all articles featuring NYTimes advertisers, so you&#039;ll never see them point out things like high maintenance fees. <br /><br />Admittedly, for the Manhattan-centric readership, the fees might not seem like a big deal, but if it were a section that weren&#039;t so obviously beholden to advertisers, the writers would probably be more inclined to take a look at what other pre-war buildings with similar amenities maintenance fees are.

I know I would. People own a lot more stuff these days. I think it was a good move. Generally people don&#039;t need that much space in a bedroom for furniture, a 12x12 bedroom can accommodate a queen bedroom set. but closet space is always at a premium.<br /><br />But they refrained from chopping up the apartments into extra bedrooms and making dining rooms bedrooms. So it&#039;s a good compromise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To each his own. I would prefer to have a large bedroom, but then, I live here and I know the closets are very roomy. The two in my bedroom aren&#039;t walk-ins, but seriously, I don&#039;t need to actually step into them to use them. And I have two other very deep closets and one that&#039;s smaller.<br /><br />And about the kitchens and dining areas, if a property developer wants to follow the modern preference for open floor plans, fine, but just say that and don&#039;t pretend you&#039;re honoring the original design. What they&#039;re doing is taking down walls and opening up hallways while actually making the kitchens themselves smaller. But if they put it that way it won&#039;t sound anywhere near as lofty as &quot;respecting the space&quot; and &quot;preserving the grandeur.&quot; (And sure, Lilybell, preserving the moldings and arched doors is part of that, but I still feel like it&#039;s mostly RE bull when they take a prewar apartment and make dramatic changes to the floor plan but still try to trade on the prewar charm.)

I&#039;d say I&#039;m pretty reasonable about the need to update appliances, add AC, make a home more energy-efficient, and so on. But (in my opinion), changing the look by pulling down walls and changing the room sizes and proportions, and getting rid of curved walls and arches (or adding them, if they weren&#039;t there in the original), or, say, exposing brick when the brick wasn&#039;t exposed in the original home (not at WP, but done a lot) is not honoring the original design or &quot;preserving the grandeur.&quot; I understand why a realtor or architect would make that claim, since Jackson Heights is known for its lovely, classic prewar buildings.

				It&#039;s unlikely you have to pay $$$ to be featured in the section since the NY Times needs to maintain some credibility that a wall between editorial and business exists. But, it&#039;s commonly understood that wall for really advertising reliant sections (real estate, automobiles for example) is quite low.<br /><br />My guess is that someone from the developer or real estate agency contacted the section. To me in seems like a slam dunk for coverage - neighborhood that has easy and fast access to Manhattan; great visuals for the apartments and the fountain; prices that are a steal by Manhattan standards; increasing interest in the neighborhood as Western Queens prices rise.

				Me too!&nbsp; My TW internet is slower than it&#039;s supposed to be and my cable bill creeps up back to the same price no matter what I do to lower it. It&#039;s like they have a &quot;magic number&quot; they want me to pay and if I get rid of one service, they just increase the price of something else within a couple of months to make up for it. <br /><br />I noticed that the most expensive two-bedroom (674K) was listed as in contract a few days ago (apt. A24). It looks like a few more one bedrooms sold as well. I&#039;m curious to see how many sales are listed in the new document that will be posted in the lobby this weekend. If it&#039;s over 20, I think there&#039;s a decent change that they will start closings by the end of July (the attorney said they will probably start closing when they hit 35% renovated units sold instead of 50%).<br /><br />Have you heard anything about how many tenants are planning to purchase their apartments?&nbsp; I guess July 8 is the new deadline. I know of three in my building - but I don&#039;t really go around asking people about it so there might be more. However, there are quite a few elderly folks in my building who I know aren&#039;t planning to purchase.

Even sweeter, the 1,500-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath, repped by Nu-Place Realty, has an asking price under a million: $935,000 to be exact. <br /><br />Apartments in the Art Deco prewar building, built in 1940, has classic features from that era, like high ceilings, crown moldings, and archways. The Italian-style kitchen in this apartment will have solid wood cabinetry, Caesarstone countertops and stainless steel appliances, and the bathrooms have Grohe Grandera accessories.&quot; click link above for article<br /><br />(http://www.brickunderground.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_primary_image/public/blog/images/Washington%20Plaza%20C51%20Living%20Dining%20.jpg?itok=PXNgkZAT)

				Hey Simka! <br /><br />I ended up purchasing a renovated unit because buying my current unit would have left me with a $900 maintenance fee and I wanted to get away from facing 73rd.&nbsp; The unit I bought is a bit smaller than what I have now but I really didn&#039;t need an 1100 sf 1-bedroom.&nbsp; I&#039;ll missing having 5 closets but I won&#039;t miss blowing a fuse multiple times a day. I have to decide between lights and a/c when I get ready in the morning because I can&#039;t have both!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m so glad I purchased before they raised the prices. I think they have hit the 15%. My guess is that they will start closings with the current tenants first. There are two renovated apartments on my floor that have been finished for months except that they don&#039;t have doors for the bathroom vanity yet (what used to be the metal hamper).&nbsp; <br /><br />I was given an estimate of late Sept. for my apartment but I don&#039;t think it will be ready until around Thanksgiving. <br /><br />Are you going to purchase your unit? (I won&#039;t be hurt if you prefer not to answer that!)<br /><br />

				I&#039;m sorry to hear that, jleach!&nbsp; I already live in the building so I sat and studied the floor plans for hours and hours and made an offer on a specific apartment that hadn&#039;t been listed for sale yet. The only reason they negotiated at all (but I still paid full price) is because they want my current apartment. <br /><br />The owner really understands the market and is willing to wait to get the prices she wants. It was a bit of sticker shock at first, but like Rhino wrote, I&#039;m looking at the long term.<br /><br />NY1 mentioned that the prices in our part of Queens have gone up by 36% in the last quarter.<br /><br />simka: I totally get why you didn&#039;t buy - those 2-bedrooms are $$$$! <br />

				Hi, the apartments going for 455K are between 886-916 sf.&nbsp; They were lower a couple of months ago (the one I bought is 916 sf but I paid 418K). The maintenance varies depending on if you face the street or the courtyard but is around 780 - 800 for that square footage.<br /><br />Here&#039;s link to what&#039;s for sale - the square footage and maintenance is listed for each one. You will see a discrepancy in prices - the lower ones were purchased early. http://www.nuplacerealty.com/?page=properties&amp;status=1&amp;agentid=11 (http://www.nuplacerealty.com/?page=properties&amp;status=1&amp;agentid=11) - I tried to link directly to washington plaza apartments but if it goes to the main page just do a search. <br /><br />Everything listed for sale there is a renovated unit.&nbsp; At some point they will start selling the unrenovated units that have rent stabilized tenants in them, but the tenants don&#039;t ever have to show anyone their apartments if they don&#039;t want to - but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the owner sells them in blocks to investors.

				simka, this is so interesting! I remember doing research early in the process and finding something that led me to believe that people WOULD have to show their apartments (I can&#039;t remember where I saw it but it might have been the red herring prospectus). I brought it up at one of our meetings and everyone disagreed with me.&nbsp; If it&#039;s true, then I agree with you and the attorney that they won&#039;t be purchased by investors - I thought that because I couldn&#039;t imagine anyone else who would be willing to buy an apartment without seeing it.

The photo/illustration of the living room is wrong for that apartment. If you&#039;re looking at the living room from the foyer area, as in the photo, there is no way doorways can be leading off to the right. That side of the living room is adjacent to the apartment next door. The listing doesn&#039;t give a floorplan for C32, but there&#039;s one in the new amendment, and it doesn&#039;t show any rooms or hallways going off the right side of the living room, either. Also, the $615K price doesn&#039;t match the price for C32 in the amendment. In fact, I didn&#039;t see any apartment listed that had an outsider price of $615K.

Seemed like a hassle, especially on days where you might have to throw out the trash 2-3 times. Much prefer a chute. <br /><br />Maybe some newer pre wars have chutes, IDK.

				Why do you say that?&nbsp; They hit their 50% goal quickly.&nbsp; The larger apartments will take longer to sell because of the price, but the one-bedrooms are going fast(except for a few that have awkward floor plans).&nbsp; There are quite a few apartments that haven&#039;t even been released for sale yet because they are renovating them in batches. <br /><br />The owner doesn&#039;t accept offers lower than the asking price. She&#039;d rather wait for a full-price sale and she&#039;s in no rush now that the conversion has been approved.

				Closings started last Wednesday. I have a new neighbor across the hall but I haven&#039;t met him yet. I have a walk-through in a few weeks and I assume I&#039;ll close the week after - probably right before or after Thanksgiving (finally! I was given a closing estimate of late Sept. when I signed the contract).&nbsp; My renovations are supposed to be completed in the next two weeks but I&#039;m not holding my breath. Just my luck that I&#039;m in the batch that&#039;s way behind schedule.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m off to streeteasy to look at sales prices!&nbsp; <br /><br />Edited: OK I&#039;m back and confused about the one-bedroom that sold for higher than the asking price. I think newjhuser might be correct that it was bought at the amended price. It was probably first listed at 428K (in april) and then was one of the ones that had the prices raised in early June. It went into contract after the owner raised the prices on a bunch of them so maybe that explains it. We should be able to figure it out after a few more closings.

				Oh, I didn&#039;t realize you had also purchased a unit!&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess it depends on when you went into contract along with how far along they are with renovations (unless you are one of the people who moved in and are renting while waiting to close).

				How can one building drive up prices?<br /><br />That&#039;s impossible.<br /><br />A &quot;thing&quot; is only worth the amount others are prepared to pay for it.<br /><br />If folks are prepared to pay the price...that&#039;s the price.<br /><br />If they&#039;re not prepared to pay that price...they won&#039;t buy it.<br /><br />This applies equally to shoes, bagels and apartments...etc.<br /><br />As well, my guess is that Washington Plaza is pretty close to the main transit hub. And folks might pay more for that convenience. <br /><br />

So that may be partly why the prices are higher than you think they would normally be for apartments like this. Also there may be potential buyers with plenty of money who actually wouldn&#039;t be able to pass a board, due to working freelance or other reasons.

				I think a gut reno would be way more than 100K. The Washington Plaza renos are going down to the studs and includes a lot of electrical work.

I think you&#039;d be hard pressed to spend 20k to renovate a 7x5 NYC bathroom unless you were getting everything completely custom made and fancy imported tiles or something. Looking at the WP reno&#039;s I seriously doubt they spent anywhere near 100k per apt on the reno.

But the kitchen is usually the biggest expense. <br /><br />personally I like 80th street much better, I find the lower 70&#039;s to be congested, and kind of dirty and foul smelling in the summer. But i realize that&#039;s just a matter of preference.

				I&#039;m supposed to close a few days after Christmas. The renovations are pretty much done (still need a few random things like a toilet seat and a door knob on the front door). I received a walk-through notice for before Thanksgiving but no one bothered to order the appraisal or send a notice-to-close. I&#039;m not sure if they forgot, but my gut says that they didn&#039;t think the renovation would be done in time for the walk-through (it wasn&#039;t). They then tried to give me a closing date a few days before Xmas but I&#039;ll be out of town. I&#039;m returning a couple of days before the closing and am crossing my fingers there are no storms to keep me stranded out of town. <br /><br />The apartment looks great. The only thing I don&#039;t like is the tile they chose for the bathroom floor but they wouldn&#039;t let me get a different color (I was willing to pay more and to get the same brand and tile size - I just don&#039;t like grey). But the real estate agent refused to find out. I wish I had pushed her a bit because I have a feeling the owner would have allowed it.

				Oh, I realize that I didn&#039;t really answer your question (I misunderstood you).&nbsp; The original completion date was supposed to be October 7!&nbsp; Then it got moved to November 11.&nbsp; Still wasn&#039;t ready during the walkthrough the week after. They never actually told me those dates - I only knew them because I asked the super.

				I&#039;ve been lurking on these boards (and on this thread) for about a month now, and figured it was good time to come out of the shadows, considering my wife and I have just entered into contract. Specifically, on the unit I think some people might have been watching (and was posted about in this thread): E61/62. The 4BR/3BA.<br /><br />We want this to be our &quot;forever home.&quot;<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m looking forward to joining the Jackson Heights community. I think many people had this notion that the folks who were going to buy the more expensive units were going to come from Manhattan or Brooklyn. But my wife and I (along with our two year old), live in LIC now. And before that, we lived in Jamaica, where I went to school (St. John&#039;s). So, we&#039;re coming from having experienced living at various ends of the Queens spectrum.<br /><br />All that being said, I&#039;m a bit in the same boat as Lilybell (who seems to be the matriarch of this thread — hi!). I get the impression it&#039;s a long road ahead before our unit will be complete. There are literally no walls in there right now. So, we&#039;re taking the &quot;it&#039;ll be done when it&#039;s done,&quot; approach. We&#039;re deeply invested in LIC as civic leaders in the community. So, there&#039;s really no rush for us to pick up and leave. We kid of expected to wait about six months. Until I read Lilybell&#039;s surprisingly long timeline for what is a smaller apartment. You are like a Buddhist monk.<br /><br />Nice to meet you all!<br /><br />P.S. My handle is MrPlaza because my last name is Plaza, not because I&#039;ll be living in Washington Plaza. Haha.

				Welcome, Mr.Plaza! Congratulations on your purchase of what is going to be an absolutely gorgeous apartment when it&#039;s finished. The renovations are supposed to take 4 months start to finish but I have a feeling it will be longer than that for the 4-bedroom since it&#039;s a merge of two apartments and more complicated in general. Mine took longer than usual because I made an offer on an apartment that wasn&#039;t for sale yet, so it had to catch up to others in the same &quot;batch&quot; (they renovate in batches). <br /><br />newjhuser, I am also moving to the A building and have a feeling you might end up directly above me! I&#039;m going to be in A52. I hope you like bagpipes; I just started taking lessons and love to practice all hours of the night. <br /><br />I&#039;ll see if I can find out when they are going to start on the gym - the super mentioned it but I already forgot what he said except that it&#039;s going to be in the basement of the D building (around the corner from the door with the ramp). <br /><br />I think a get-together sounds great and am really looking forward to meeting my new neighbors.<br /><br />(just kidding about the bagpipes)&nbsp;

				Thanks for the warm welcome, all. We look forward to meeting you all. My wife and I are uncommonly friendly. As a testament to that, the officiant at our wedding was actually a couple we sold a desk to over Craigslist. And two of our closest friends are people who joined us for the tour of our current apartment three years ago. We also like to entertain. I make craft cocktails as a hobby and my wife likes making cheese and fruit plates. And we both like to drink wine. Haha. So, we&#039;re definitely people persons, and really want to get to know our neighbors. And since we&#039;re only having the one baby, it&#039;s important to us that he grows up being sociable.<br /><br />So, all that to say: 100% down for a get-together!<br /><br />Since we&#039;re talking about timelines, there were a couple of questions that I had been wondering: <br /><br />1) I&#039;m also curious to know about the gym, but all the common areas in general. My understanding is that everything is being renovated. I read somewhere that the courtyard will be as well, which was confusing. What about it is being renovated?<br /><br />2) Somewhere on this thread someone said the building was being wired for Verizon FIOS. Is that true? Is that still happening? Because we&#039;d be leaving behind RCN — which we LOVE — for what appears to be TWC/Spectrum. Which feels like a special kind of torture.

The management will not sign off on it. They are waiting until after the halls are renovated. (which seems odd. Why would they want the mess AFTER the halls have been renovated?)<br /><br />Verizon said that even after management signs off on it, it could take a year to get it installed since they have a long waiting list.<br /><br />Welcome to the building.&nbsp; :D

				Hi fellow neighbors!<br />I, too, like Mr. Plaza lingered on this post for the past 5 months and now I&#039;ve finally joined in to say...HELLO! I&#039;M genuinely excited to be part of the Washington Plaza family and part of this amazing neighborhood&#039;s fabric!<br />I&#039;m so glad to hear that I&#039;m not the only one that painfully endured a long process from the date of offer being accepted to actually closing. I bought my 2 bedroom in the D building in May and finally moved in November. It was seriously the longest few months bc I was just looking forward to being in this neighborhood! I&#039;m a Queens gal through and through. Lived in other places and Queens is where I always come back to as HOME. Being in JH has even reaffirmed that notion. <br />I would LOVE a get-together as I&#039;m really looking to build a community within the building and make new friends in the hood. I&#039;m a single mom of a daughter who is by the way looking for babysitting gigs. She&#039;s responsible, so good with kids, smart and very mature. Also loves to sing, a lot and all the time, so we apologize in advance if you hear her. She will be 12 this Sunday! You may see us together like sisters, she&#039;s a super kid!!!<br />I&#039;m so excited to learn that the gym will be in the D building! I can&#039;t wait for this to be finished but I heard that may be the last phase which seemed like another year of constant construction. <br />So far, I&#039;m so happy about the purchase. I love the neighbors I have met this far. The staff here is by far the best group of such hard working, sweet and helpful people. We feel very lucky. <br />As far as the courtyard, I heard that they wanted to restone the fountain edges and just update the gardening. <br />I also thought I&#039;d be super upset about losing FiOs but TWC must have some amazing deals with WP bc my network connection speed is super fast! I don&#039;t own cable so I&#039;m only dealing with the internet and I can&#039;t complain!<br />anyway, we can&#039;t wait to eventually meeting all of you! <br />Good night!

				They said 50 apartments sold give or take. We can check what&#039;s been listed on Streetyeasy (31 for sale), so I venture to guess 19 of them went to renters at the inside price? The complex also holds around 190, so 25% of the apartments have been sold to people leaving 75% in the hands of the owner.

				&nbsp;I meant mortgage approval for the apartment. My understanding is a rate is only locked in for 90 days.

Missing words, perhaps? <br /><br />&nbsp;Given that 22% of the JH population is below the poverty level, it&#039;s safe to assume that there is significant doubling and tripling of families in those rental apartments. 59% of those people are rent-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on rent. Because they are often sharing apartments, their numbers aren&#039;t showing up in your count of the &quot;slim&quot; number of rental buildings. Rental buildings, of course, include the many illegally subdivided multi-family houses in this part of Queens. <br /><br />I understand that you want your million plus apartment to increase in value, and that requires more luxury conversions. But just know that your desires (your ilk will probably get what you want) are going to cause real harm to the most vulnerable among us. <br /><br />Nope, nothing wrong with cured meats at all. But it is kind of odd that you&#039;ve brought up your love of it so frequently, given that it&#039;s so uninteresting.

And, why at this price?<br /><br />I too like charcuterie but this is a Tikka and Churro neighborhood now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First off: Happy New Year, all! I appreciate you asking kindly, jh35. I&#039;d be happy to give you a little more context.<br /><br />Some background: My wife and I (along with our 2-year old) are coming from renting in Long Island City. We&#039;ve lived in one of the towering new constructions in Court Square for three years now. To be frank, we were saddened by the prospect of leaving because we also happen to be the founders of the neighborhood civic association; which was founded to help guide — and when necessary stand up to — the rapid development taking place here. So, forgive me, frances, if I find it a bit jarring to be accused of being ignorant to how neighborhoods are both developed and torn down. That being said, change isn&#039;t categorically bad. Jackson Heights itself was not always the community it is today. It was built explicitly as a place for middle and upper-middle class whites, and was fairly exclusionary to that end. Then...over several decades, it changed into the community you&#039;re saying my &quot;ilk&quot; is destroying. Some would say that it changed for the better to include more diversity. Others might say it&#039;s a travesty that destroyed the foundation on which &quot;The Garden City&quot; was built. I fall on the side of the former, but it really is a matter of perspective.<br /><br />Back to the point: When my wife and I decided that we wanted to own, we concluded we couldn&#039;t afford anything here in LIC that&#039;s larger than what we have now (2BR/2BA). And it didn&#039;t make sense for us to leave our large rent-stabilized apartment, pay more per month, and in several cases lose up to 100 sq. ft. in the process. <br /><br />So, we broadened our search to include other neighborhoods within Queens (which was important for me as someone who spent much of his life in and around the borough). We lived in Jamaica before this, and knew we didn’t want to go back to living that far out. Furthermore, coming from living in Court Square, a place with at least two train options was preferable. Initially we were fairly adamant about staying in our community/council district (26) as it would have allowed us to remain more involved in our local politics. But we found ourselves unable to afford Sunnyside either, without buying something that would have required renovation work. Renovation work means more money after closing. And we were already scraping together everything we had to afford a down payment. Doing any kind of renovation work was out of the question. It needed to be to our liking out of the box. And considering we’re coming from a luxury building, we wanted a degree of finish (and if at all possible, amenities) that made leaving behind everything we had in LIC, worth it.<br /><br />Enter Washington Plaza and Jackson Heights. It is just outside of our district, but the schools have solid marks; it’s very similar to Court Square, in the sense that it’s rich in train options; the units are being brought to the same level of finish as you would find in a decent LIC condo; and for the same price that we would pay to get a shoebox 2BR/2BA in our neighborhood, we were able to get E61/E62. And without going into details, I’ll add that the more expensive units have greater price flexibility. The final X-factor was the neighborhood of Jackson Heights itself. Court Square is an acquired taste. It’s chockfull of high-rises, artist studios, empty industrial streets, few restaurants/bars, and even fewer green spaces. Frankly, it’s a challenge living here sometimes; but it was our challenge. We believe it will reach its full potential one day, as a community, and not just a neighborhood. But that’s years off. Jackson Heights — being an older neighborhood — already benefits from having that community. Everything from the soon-to-be renovated Travers Park, to the greenmarket, told us that JH was already a great place to live, but was poised for even greater heights.<br /><br />So, we took the leap. It was expensive. But no more than staying in LIC. And if we were going to move, we might as well move to the one building, in a culturally and transit-rich neighborhood, that was going to remind us the most of our home today, without us doing the work to get it there.<br /><br />I hope that answers your question.

				What&#039;s up everyone!&nbsp; Happy New Year!&nbsp; I was away for a couple of weeks and then I came back and closed on the apartment and moved.<br /><br />I closed on the 29th and still cannot get the damn punch list guy to do anything. He is absolutely non-responsive and I am fed up. I&#039;ve been patient so far but that&#039;s about to change and now I&#039;m going to be a huge pain in the butt until they fix what still needs to be done.<br /><br />I think I have defective kitchen counters -there are weird white marks all over them (and at least 10 chips). I am not going to accept them in this condition. It took over a week to get a toilet seat and I only got one because the super took care of it (which is not his job but he is so good to me). I&#039;m missing a window screen, there are a lot of scratches on the wood floors (I&#039;m willing to live with the scratches except for one huge one that is really obvious). The door of the bathroom vanity doesn&#039;t close. They never put shelves in my pantry. And there are lots of little things that I&#039;m just going to give up on (paint touch-ups, etc). <br /><br />I was so stupid because I decided to just have movers come for the furniture and decided to move everything else myself in a big shopping cart because I didn&#039;t want to deal with packing boxes. What was I thinking!&nbsp; I was already exhausted from painting the bedroom and living room and I drastically underestimated how long it would take and how much crap I had in the other apartment (you can fit a lot into 6 big closets). So now I have stuff strewn all over my floors waiting to be put away. I was so physically tired that I think I had an out-of-body experience on Monday. <br /><br />But as stressful as it&#039;s been, it&#039;s a beautiful apartment and I know I&#039;ll be thrilled once I get everything put away and get my new furniture delivered. And curtains!&nbsp; I am living like a college student with sheets taped up over the windows. Oddly, none of my blinds from the old apartment fit this one - you&#039;d think they&#039;d have the same sized windows in all of the buildings but I guess not. They are all about&nbsp; an inch smaller. <br /><br />babycakes mama - I wonder if I lived next to you for a couple of weeks before I moved to the new apartment. If your neighbor was making a lot of noise with a shopping cart over the last week at ridiculously early hours (and swearing a lot), that was me!&nbsp; I know a woman with a daughter moved in next to me and I have a feeling it might be you. But I was out of town for two weeks and I guess we never ran into each other. <br /><br />But welcome to all of you! I&#039;ve met a few of the new owners and everyone has been really nice so far (and one has an adorable new puppy). <br /><br />Off to send a passive aggressive email to the punch list guy!

So, I&#039;m curious to know how difficult it is from start to finish — and if there are any tips for getting things done faster. Once you&#039;re settled in, take photos for the rest of us! Haha.

				Hi MrPlaza!&nbsp; I think my mistake with the punch list guy was that I was too patient and nice and didn&#039;t cc the owner in the first few emails. I sent a polite email every few days. I didn&#039;t get a chance to send a passive-aggressive email yesterday but I just sent one a few minutes ago. I was much firmer and showed my frustration this time, which I hope helps. It takes a lot to piss me off, but when I get to that point I will make a nuisance of myself. Not sure what I&#039;ll do if I don&#039;t get a response - maybe go make a scene in the sales office? It&#039;s not my style but I&#039;m starting to get fed up. <br /><br />The super and the seller&#039;s attorney both warned me that the punch list guy is very non-responsive, so if I were you, I would use that knowledge to your advantage early on and get something in writing at the closing with a date limit on how long they can take to get the remaining items finished. Or you could tell them that you refuse to close before they finish the punch list. They had over a month from my first walk through and they barely did a thing during that time. They did nothing at all between my final walk through and actual closing (it was only two days). I have a feeling they might be more efficient with you because you bought one of the largest apartments. <br /><br />I&#039;m also wondering if I have so many punch list items because they rushed towards the end as to not have yet another delay. The finish work was almost shoddy in some areas (paint drips, scratches, dried plaster smears, chips in the counters and bathtub - things that come from rushing and not paying close attention). <br /><br />I&#039;m so happy it&#039;s a long weekend so I can use all three days to finish putting everything away.

				This punch list story is calling up memories of when I was in a similar situation many years ago, buying a newly renovated apartment in a new coop conversion. The takeaway lesson was: insist on everything being finished before you close and before you move in, because the likelihood of these things being done afterwards goes down dramatically despite their promises. The things that I wanted done/fixed were much more minor than what you mention, but I believe they never were done and I just gave up finally. Same situation when we renovated our kitchen. The counter top was not cut properly to fit around the stove, but we were never able to get the company to fix the error. They paid lip service and promised to call, promised to come, then they simply didn&#039;t call and didn&#039;t come to whatever appointment we had made. There is no way to force them to do these things short of a lawsuit, which is unaffordable. Just a bit of advice for anyone in the process of buying: don&#039;t close until the renovation is finished and the punch list addressed.

				Today I was walking doing errands and passed WP and decided to stroll inside the interior garden. Wasn&#039;t sure if this is allowed but with all the talk about the building on this thread said what the heck. I wanted to say how surprise I was to find such a beautiful, peaceful setting. I had friends who lived there many years ago and don&#039;t remember it being so lovely. It truely is an oasis and must be really soothing and tranquil&nbsp; in the warmer months.&nbsp; Pretty impressive considering the crap you find elsewhere.

				Hey Lilybell, did they make a complaint if you moved stuff yourself? I was thinking of moving in a table and rug myself. I don&#039;t know if they were making a stink about it. I also see people leaving stuff out in the hallway? Is that allowed? I thought the bylaws were very strict on that.

				petster, I don&#039;t think there are any rules against non-tenants walking through the grounds.&nbsp; <br /><br />hi newjhuser, I don&#039;t think they care at all if you move items yourself. I only used movers for my furniture. Regarding stuff in the hallways - I never used to see it in my old building but I see it in my new building - there&#039;s a kids bike in the hallway upstairs and my neighbor left his ladder outside his door for a few days. The ladder wouldn&#039;t bother me but a permanent bike would. My guess is that things will start to get more strict as more and more people move in (and once there&#039;s an actual board instead of just the owner).<br /><br />ljr, I sure wish I had done exactly what you recommend (regarding punch lists). I still haven&#039;t heard back from the guy, except I did get an email from the owner over the weekend expressing her concern. So that is somewhat of a relief that I&#039;m not just going to be ignored forever. <br /><br />I was so happy to have yesterday off - I got so much put away and finally got my living room curtains up so I no longer feel so exposed.&nbsp;

				Thanks for sharing all these details with us, Lilybell. I shared the information with our lawyer just to see if there was any protection we can provide ourselves with regard to closing with a finished punch list. It&#039;s interesting that the owner is allowing such poor management of something as simple as a punch list. Definitely something to keep an eye on as we draw nearer to closing sometimes this Spring/Summer.

				Hi, to be fair, I got a response quickly once I cc&#039;d the owner on my email to the punch list guy. She then personally emailed me twice to apologize and tell me that she told him to get in touch with me. And it worked - I think I am going to see him today or tomorrow. <br /><br />It&#039;s not that the punch list guy is lazy - he is just overwhelmed with work and probably deals with the pushier people first. So I had to switch my normally laid-back manner to become one of the pushy people. And he was on vacation for a couple of weeks, so his &quot;to-do&quot; list is probably ridiculous. He&#039;s actually a very nice guy and I like him; I just wish he had more people to help him.

				My apologies if this issue has been covered earlier in the thread (it&#039;s a long thread!): Streeteasy just showed four 2 bedroom units having closed in the last day or so at Washington Plaza.&nbsp; Two of them appear to have sold for about $450,000 and two of them sold for well over $600,000.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure out from the listing info what the key differences are to warrant such a discrepancy.&nbsp; It&#039;s true that the cheaper ones are listed as 4.0 rooms and the more expensive as 4.5, and the difference here seems to be an eat-in kitchen. But the square footage listed is pretty similar. Just curious!<br /><br />Here are a couple of links: http://streeteasy.com/sale/1256081<br /><br />http://streeteasy.com/sale/1256625<br />

				The 450K one was originally a one bedroom apartment and then it was converted to a very small 2bedroom apartment by putting the kitchen in the middle or original living room, the current living room is very small about 10x10. While the 600k one was originally a big Junior 4 apartment, which can be converted to 2 bedroom apartment easily. Other than the window facing eat-in kitchen, the living room is the regular size 10x20.<br /><br />The total area for the 600K is probably at least 20% greater than the the 450K and it is a fact that large apartments demand more dollars per square feet. so it works out probably right. If you check the maintenance fee, it&#039;s1200 against 880, which is the same ratio of the price 600K vs 450K<br /><br />

				I thought I had internet issues until I bought a new computer. That fixed everything! I don&#039;t have any problems with Time Warner (except for their exorbitant prices). We went through a period a few months ago with multiple outages but that was because workmen accidentally cut a cable or something (I can&#039;t remember the exact problem). It was very frustrating but I haven&#039;t had any problems since. I had an outage a few days ago, but that wasn&#039;t just Washington Plaza - when I called TWC I got that &quot;there&#039;s an outage in your area&quot; recording and it was fixed by that evening. <br /><br />I wonder if it&#039;s just one building that has issues and not all six. <br /><br />Not sure when we&#039;ll get Verizon Fios - the punch list guy told me it would be a few months.

				Most of the time the internet is acceptable. There have been many problems in the past that were always blamed on building problems. For years after I moved in, the TV was terrible and the internet was abominable. The internet would work for a few seconds and stop for a second. Then they fixed it and for a while (years) it has been ok. Now, it seems to me, based on the speed test, that the modem is dropping multiple streams when the internet leaves NYC. And, as I said, the cable card drops the EMM&#039;s.<br /><br />Also, the laundry room card machine is out for the third week in a row. There is a sign on it saying they are working with Verizon. The phones went out a few months ago and Verizon put in a new cooper cable from the Central Office. <br /><br />This is a nice building but it is a solidly middle class, middle service, certainly not luxury as they seem to portray it now. There have always been heat, electricity, water, and gas service problems that have been mostly fixed when they renovated the apartments. It will be interesting to see how they maintain the building now that people have spent so much for the co-ops. <br /><br />The renovations that they did were not what they could have been. The water pipes are narrow, especially to secondary bathrooms. The electrical boxes in the basement were not upgraded after they changed the risers to the apartments. <br /><br />Let&#039;s not even mention the constant mold problem. <br /><br />All in all, I like living here, although it sounds like I do not.<br /><br />I await FIOS which is in the basement, but management will not let them wire the building (yet?).

They modified the house rules where you can request approval for pets, but I&#039;m afraid that would just tip them off.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a new house rule that forbids smells in the halls, including food. That seems like an excuse to hassle minority renters that cook ethnic food.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know where to find your email address or know how to msg you from here.<br /><br />House rules do NOT apply to renters. You can cook any smelly thing you want to. You only follow the city and state laws and your lease. In other words, if you pay your rent, you can do almost anything. That is a strange thing about co-ops. You pay more and you have to follow more rules than the renters. <br /><br />I saw a woman openly walking her dog the other day. I had never seen her before. <br /><br />Regarding your cat, I think there is a rule giving the owner some time to object and after that they can not.<br /><br />

				Hi gsmayes!&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought you moved out; it&#039;s nice to see you here. <br /><br />First, most of the house rules are the same as what&#039;s already on the rental leases. The cooking smell rule is new and stupid. It&#039;s not our fault we have crappy ventilation and it feels a bit &quot;the more affluent owners that will be moving in might not like the odors from ethnic food&quot; to me. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about having a cat! I&#039;ve seen so many new dogs in the building and there are quite a few tenants (not owners) who were able to get pets allowed - they&#039;ve completely changed the rules.. If you know the guy in D in the big one-bedroom on the 5th floor who has a new-ish dog (I feel like I shouldn&#039;t write his name here), I&#039;d ask him what he did. At first they tried to make him get rid of her but he worked it out and is now allowed to keep her. <br /><br />You are NOT going to be evicted when your lease is up. They have to renew your lease until your rent goes up to market rate, which is $2700 I think? The only people they are trying to evict are a few illegal subletters (there are 5 illegal subletters shoved into the small one-bedroom next to my new apartment). I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they also throw cash at a few problematic tenants to get them to move out, but you aren&#039;t in that category. <br /><br />They can take you out of preferential rent but once you aren&#039;t in preferential rent, they can&#039;t raise your rent higher than whatever percentage rent increase was decided by the Rent Guidelines Board that year. <br /><br />They used to allow pets until someone was found to have a bunch of decomposing cats in his apartment (over 10 years ago) and that caused the rule change. I&#039;m pretty confident they are going to relax the pet rules quite a bit - they might have a problem with large dogs or a loud parrot but you won&#039;t have a problem keeping your cat. <br /><br />I found this article on preferential rent to be very interesting:<br />https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160419/central-harlem/heres-why-some-rent-stabilized-tenants-are-seeing-huge-increases (https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160419/central-harlem/heres-why-some-rent-stabilized-tenants-are-seeing-huge-increases)

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />I had my mortgage through Chase - we had no choice but to use them until the building hit 50% sold. After that, people were able to shop around for a lender. I was not very happy with Chase either, noob - the guy was very nice but his assistant was a total flake. And there was a screw-up with my rate lock that ended up raising my rate by a half-percentage point, but that&#039;s a confusing story I won&#039;t go into here (and it was half my fault, half theirs).&nbsp; <br /><br />My appraisal was for the exact same price I paid for the apartment. I don&#039;t think anyone has to worry about a lower appraisal. But I&#039;m not sure what article from DNAinfo you are discussing.&nbsp; Totally unrelated, but I don&#039;t understand why streeteasy shows that I paid more for the apartment than I really did. <br /><br />MrPlaza, I&#039;m sorry to hear about your delay!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m still having some new-owner issues - I&#039;ve come home 3 times now to find my front door wide open even though I locked it before I left. Something is just not catching properly and when a door slams elsewhere it pops my door open. Thank god my neighbors are trustworthy! But now it&#039;s yet another thing I have to complain about. I still haven&#039;t heard back about my dishwasher (which I think was installed improperly) and they are supposed to come sand my counters but it&#039;s been another two weeks of radio silence. Time for another passive aggressive email! <br /><br />But just so I&#039;m not full of complaints when I post here: I love that every single light has a dimmer (except the foyer) - even the lights under the kitchen cabinets. My new neighbors are really nice. The guy who moved in upstairs around the same time I did is very quiet and I can rarely even hear him walking. It&#039;s not as hot as my former apartment, thank god. And the best part - there is SO MUCH LESS STREET NOISE on 74th compared to 73rd. It has really affected my quality of life for the better. <br /><br />

				Yes, they&#039;ve sold more like 70% or more by now and the conversion was made official a few months ago. Please take this with a grain of salt because my knowledge is lacking in this area, but I&#039;m pretty sure you can change your lender -it might cause delays in that you&#039;d have to order a new appraisal, but Chase didn&#039;t order my appraisal until the last minute so yours might not have been ordered either. If there has already been an appraisal they can charge you for it if you switch lenders, but it doesn&#039;t sound like you&#039;ve had one yet. But one good thing about Chase is that the person who does the W. Plaza appraisals for them is pretty much just appraising them all for the sale price.&nbsp;

				I knew that Citizens Bank was an option when we visited the building the first time, but the Chase banker who was there kind of steered us away by insisting that no one knows the intricacies of a co-op sale as well as them. And that&#039;s citizens bank would end up stalling out at some point. I guess the scare tactic worked, because we ended up working with chase for our mortgage. It&#039;s been &quot;okay&quot; so far. Some pockets of unresponsiveness. But it&#039;s not been that way the whole way through.<br /><br />Really getting worried about a long punch list, Lilybell.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I just randomly happened to come across this site, and as a new resident of Washington Plaza, I wanted to introduce myself on this thread. My wife and I, along with our 2-year-old son, moved into our unit in the B building at the end of December, and I have to say that we couldn&#039;t be happier. Everyone we&#039;ve met has been so friendly and welcoming (including you, Lilybell...I believe we met in the laundry room once). I look forward to meeting the rest of you soon, and am very excited to raise my family here.<br /><br />As an aside, for those of you concerned with your appraisal, my unit was actually appraised for higher than my purchase price! Talk about instant equity!<br /><br />- Dan

				I&#039;m looking at the offering plan, and I saw something about the co-op complex having a first mortgage which matures on 12/1/19, at which point the principal balance of ~$6M will be due (if the co-op cannot arrange for an extension or refinancing).&nbsp; Apparently if such arrangements are not made, the co-op will be responsible for paying this $6M amount, which may result in a special assessment for each shareholder.&nbsp; This is all on page 6, paragraph 18 of the offering plan.&nbsp; Does anyone know anything about this and/or has anyone had discussions about the implications of this with his or her lawyer?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I am not a lawyer, but it is common for coops to carry mortgages. Assuming the financials of this coop aren&#039;t garbage, they should be able to refinance that $6M at a low rate.<br /><br />The tax deductible portion of your maintenance may include your portion of the mortgage interest and property tax (prorated by # of shares you own).

				I received my initial estimate of March when I was going into contract in November.&nbsp; That seemed reasonable to me (I admittedly know nothing about construction timelines) because my apartment had not even begun renovations.&nbsp; I reached out to the broker in March and was told things were running behind a little behind schedule and now I was looking at a June appraisal and move in per the construction team.&nbsp; I assume these new estimates are realistic but I haven&#039;t verified anything.<br /><br />Luckily my current landlord is flexible and I can wait it out.&nbsp;

They had the work crews running from apartment to apartment doing the renovations. <br /><br />The major work seems to be done based upon the observation of fewer workers running around and less noise and filth in the halls. I am sure it is hard to coordinate all of the deliveries and installations even after the walls are finished.<br /><br />Now, they have offered buy-outs to the existing tenants and I wonder how many people have accepted this. I hope it does not start another round of renovations since this round has lasted for about 3 years. <br /><br />Also, did anyone check the amperage of the apartments? They never seemed to install new electrical boxes in the basement.

				We just did our initial walkthrough this week and will close May 31st. We bought what was the construction office so when we saw it it was already renovated. It was full of boxes of supplies though. We had also seen the complex twice for different units in the middle of winter after snowstorms. It was dirty snow covered and gloomy but we decide to place an offer on the second unit we saw. When we walked into the complex this week it was green and beautiful with full bloom landscaping.&nbsp; To be honest we were afraid we&#039;d walk in to the unit and ask &quot;what did we do&quot;. Instead we thought how beautiful. It was bright with natural light and beyond what we remembered in terms of details and finish. We&#039;ll move in the end of June. I hope everyone feels the happiness we did about seeing the final product.<br /><br />I was told the gym may or may not be done by the end of the year. Sorry I can&#039;t be more vaugue.

The buyout offers were so low, I imagine that the ones who took it were already wanting to get out.

The cost of renovating the apartment? If that&#039;s it, yeah, I realize that. But they are also getting huge profits in return. The $20K-$40K the sponsor offered (average payout $28K, with most between $25K and $35K) is measly compared to what they will make on the apartments, even factoring in the renovation costs. But the real issue is whether that figure would make it worth it to the renters to move. If the tenant wasn&#039;t already looking to leave, probably not. These are nice apartments and convenient to Manhattan and they&#039;d need more than $35K to find anything comparable.

But in the hallway...it&#039;s not that uncommon. The building we currently live in in LIC has carpenting in the hallways. Perhaps the upside is that our carpets are regularly cleaned by one of the many porters employed by the management company. Probably won&#039;t be as consistent here, which could lead to some messy halls...

				carpeting in the hallway reduces noise in the hallway. And if the carpeting is the squares, it means sections of the carpet can be easily replaced.

				What&#039;s up everyone!!!!&nbsp; Work has been insanely busy so I haven&#039;t been here for at least 3 months.&nbsp; I have so much to say.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The hallway reno photos above - I&#039;m pretty sure that is not the finished product and that there will not be carpeting. I&#039;ll see what I can find out. <br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are going to have to offer higher buyouts if they really want to get rid of tenants.&nbsp; <br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to all of the new people - and Dan, it was nice to meet you in the laundry room even though I was dressed like a hobo. <br />4.&nbsp; &nbsp;I closed three months after the estimated date (for those of you who are still waiting for your renos)<br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr P - I have photos to send you and will email them today or tomorrow. <br />6.&nbsp; I am still waiting for some of my punch list items to be completed.&nbsp; I just got a working dishwasher a few days ago (I moved in the first week of January so it took a long time). I feel very sorry for the owner because the contractors are useless jerks and it&#039;s been difficult to get them to be responsive. She is going to have to get tough with them.&nbsp; I hope she has different contractors doing the lobby and gym.<br />7.&nbsp; The gym is going to be in between the D and E buildings around the corner from the trash room, I think.&nbsp; I hope we will have access to the basement for longer hours.&nbsp; I would prefer to use the gym before 6am (the elevator doesn&#039;t go to the basement between 9pm and 6am).&nbsp; <br />8.&nbsp; Every board officer works for or has a relationship with Washington Plaza. I don&#039;t know how long their tenure will be - I missed the first owner&#039;s meeting.&nbsp; There&#039;s another owner&#039;s meeting next week. <br />9.&nbsp; I had even worse luck with my furniture order than with my move-in date.&nbsp; It was all custom made, took 2 months longer than they said it would, and the delivery truck didn&#039;t show up three different times.&nbsp; And then it showed up with crooked cushions and I am returning it all.&nbsp; Grrrr. If any of you are thinking of getting furniture from joybird.com BEWARE.&nbsp; <br />10.&nbsp; Advice to new owners:&nbsp; make friends with Robinson (the super).&nbsp; He is a great guy and is naturally helpful but he is swamped right now with all of the changes. He works for the tenants but he is always willing to lend a hand if you are friendly to him and tip him when he is helpful to you. He has been an absolute lifesaver to me and has taken care of most of my punch list problems instead of the contractor. <br /><br />I hope you are all doing well!&nbsp; <br />

				It&#039;s great to have you back Lilybell! I can&#039;t believe your punch list still isn&#039;t done! I&#039;ll be surprised if the carpeting isn&#039;t the reflective of the final product. Why put it down in the first place then? Finally, I&#039;m excited to see the photos! They said they would finish in June. Despite this, however, given what I saw a few weeks ago, I&#039;m also expecting a three month delay to September (putting me at an October move).

The fact that those apartments are then turned into renovated coops that command high prices is another. And the success of the WP conversion will encourage landlords of other Jackson Heights rental buildings to see whether they can do the same thing. So, yeah, bad news for people who are priced out of the neighborhood.

As you can see, it is set up as smaller buildings inside. They are only connected in the basement. Since there are so few apartments on each floor, especially in the A, B, E and F buildings, the quality of life depends on who your neighbors are. My floor is quiet and peaceful. <br /><br />What do you mean how is it for young couples? We don&#039;t have bikini pool parties. Starbucks is blocks away. I hope you like getting up in the middle of the night for prayers. (blah, blah, I always get woken up.)<br /><br />The management office doesn&#039;t directly get involved much with the tenants.&nbsp; They apply for increases when they think they deserve them and leave the rest to the Super. The management office is not overly aggressive. <br /><br />Before the building went co-op it was nicely maintained. Since the renovations started the building has been a noisy, filthy, dusty, mess. They clean often but the job is overwhelming. The renovations may continue for years. <br /><br />The new halls, as you can see in the test version in Building C, I think 4th floor, are, in my opinion, cheap and tasteless. <br /><br />I can not comment personally on closings, but others have said they are months late. Has you apartment been renovated? Is it finished? If it is finished, you may not have a probem with the closing. <br /><br />In my opinion, if you like the neighborhood, like the apartment, and the price seems reasonable to you (it is overpriced for this neighborhood) then go for it. <br /><br /><br />

So, jh35 and I are coming from different places.<br /><br />As suggested, renovations have generally been behind schedule to-date. Several months in most cases. Though, they picked up the pace on our unit in the last two months. So, I&#039;m hoping to close by the end of July and move sometime in August. I could imagine that given the scope of the project (and the fact that they&#039;re converting the building phase-by-phase), there is likely to be construction somewhere in the building(s) for the next several years. Whether it&#039;s construction on someone&#039;s apartment or one of the common areas. That being said, if you&#039;re planning to set down roots for the long haul, such as us, it&#039;s a temporary inconvenience.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard much negativity about the management company, though I can&#039;t speak from firsthand experience. When it comes to the day-to-day, most of your interactions will be limited to the Super and any extended staff. And just with any other building, the golden rule applies. The better you treat them, the better they&#039;ll treat you. We&#039;ve always been very friendly and appreciative of our current building&#039;s staff, which is why we have always been treated especially well.<br /><br />As for how it is for young people: Hard to tell from an outsider&#039;s perspective. My wife and I are young parents — 33 and nearly-30, respectively, with a 2.5-year-old boy. We know we skew on the younger end of the spectrum for the building/neighborhood. But we generally believe that you make it what you want. We&#039;re not far from our old hood (LIC). So, friends will still visit, and we&#039;re pretty social anyway. I think we&#039;ll always land on the edges of the age bell curve, because of the inherent barriers to ownership. But we suspect &quot;younger&quot; 30-somethings will make up an increasing number of people moving to (or within) the neighborhood/building if that&#039;s what you&#039;re asking.

				83 does seem high but I guess it&#039;s not impossible. I know there are more than 55 now that more people have moved out but I don&#039;t know the exact figure.&nbsp; I think there are only two or three available right now - my former apartment is the only one listed as for sale on streeteasy right now. There are two other ones shown as available on the washington plaza site by nu-place (wplazanyc.com).&nbsp; V<br /><br />I found out that they will definitely have carpet in the renovated hallways - I was hoping that was temporary. <br /><br />noob, the shower bar is pretty high but I guess they had to do it that way because it&#039;s easier than drilling it into the tile. Mine has fallen a bunch of times.&nbsp; Now that I think about it, it was the same height before renovations as well. I bought a normal shower curtain and it&#039;s fine (72x72).&nbsp; <br /><br />

So while it may be too late for llh and his wife and their baby, anyone considering moving here should seriously consider choosing an apartment that&#039;s surrounded by either already renovated coops or tenants who are firmly in place —that is, who can afford their rent and are not in danger of being forced out by a sudden rent hike.

What I said yesterday was based on what the two workers told me. Since then I&#039;ve heard (through the building grapevine), that the WP gardner tried unsuccessfully to reason with the managing agent, saying that the issue could be addressed by topping off the tree. The person who told me that also reported that the tree was cut down because it interfered with someone&#039;s view of the courtyard. I don&#039;t get why one person&#039;s view would trump everyone else&#039;s view. Well, I mean...I can see why, from the manager&#039;s POV, an owner&#039;s view would trump a renter&#039;s view. But even if the complainer was an owner, there are a number of owners affected by what&#039;s done in the courtyard. Why obey that particular owner&#039;s wishes and not consult all owners?<br /><br />Right now the WP board is controlled by the sponsor. Over time, as more apartments are purchased, the board&#039;s makeup will shift, and hopefully owners will have more say in matters like this.

Again, as an owner, I believe if you bought a unit with a tree outside of your window, you should have to live with that tree outside of your window. Petition for it to be trimmed, sure. But cutting it down should have never been an option because of one person&#039;s view. And not to gloat about it, but outside of the sponsor, I believe my wife and I will be the second largest shareholders. We would have never supported this action if shareholders were ever asked for their perspective. There are other ways to address obstructed views. Cutting the tree down altogether should have only been done if it was dying and/or infested and posed a danger to residents.

				Racism is discrimination and <em><strong>prejudice</strong></em> towards people based on their race or ethnicity.<br /><br />Many people, especially people from groups against whom stereotypes are used, view stereotyping as racist behavior. <br /><br />Your statement led with the fact that it was about a certain group. Couple that with the entirely negative associations/judgment about tree-cutting you have made abundantly clear in this thread (hence why I also quoted the statement about so-called quality of people) makes it hard to believe that you&#039;re not implying some type of inferiority on people who are inclined to cut trees, even all the while saying that particular group of people do it for cleanliness. <br /><br />And you know, feel free to have that opinion but let&#039;s not make it about PC or un-PC. That would be the same ruse that Donald Trump uses.

				People have been asking for that bush/tree to be drastically pruned or cut down for years.&nbsp; And it&#039;s people who rent, not new owners. The tree brushed up against the windows of a few of the corner 2-bedrooms in C and D. There are only a few of those apartments that are going to be sold (most of the tenants chose to remain renters) and the ones that are going to be sold haven&#039;t even been renovated yet, so there&#039;s no mysterious new owner with nefarious tree-hating tendencies causing problems.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad it&#039;s gone - I didn&#039;t like it.<br /><br />There&#039;s a pigeon who hangs out on my a/c and I think he&#039;s trying to move in as well.&nbsp; I&#039;d be up for it if he could be housebroken! <br />

				I lived next door to a house on a corner lot that had a lovely and healthy Magnolia tree in the front yard. The house was sold and the new owners poured concrete over most of the garden along the side of the house, over which they added a wooden deck, and were considering cutting down the tree because it was &quot;dirty.&quot; Thankfully another neighbor talked them out of it. Some folks just don&#039;t appreciate trees that make any kind of mess. I guess they are good with pine trees?

The &quot;It was really a bush&quot; argument seems laughable to me. This was what looked exactly like a tree, with a tall center trunk and limbs growing off that trunk. It reached to at least the top of the fourth floor. It was an evergreen of some sort. I guess I&#039;ll have to educate myself on the difference between bushes and trees now. <br /><br />And I&#039;m really surprised to hear about the pigeon, because what I heard, from a couple of different people, over the weekend, was that the tree was cut down because SQUIRRELS were getting into people&#039;s apartments. They chewed through screens and walked right in. One supposedly started making a nest. I can believe squirrels chewed through people&#039;s screens, but I can&#039;t believe that cutting down the tree will stop that sort of thing. I don&#039;t think it will stop birds from flying in through the windows, either, though keeping the screen closed ought to stop that (unless the pigeon flew in through a massive hole chewed by a squirrel).

But I can&#039;t help being logical about the pigeons and squirrels. The pigeons will not go away because the tree&#039;s gone. NYC pigeons don&#039;t depend on trees like other birds do. They roost on buildings. And if a pigeon flew in someone&#039;s window, it could have flown in from anywhere. If the residents don&#039;t want any more pigeons flying in their windows, I&#039;d advise them to keep their screens closed.<br /><br />And the cutting down of the tree surely caused squirrels to lose their homes, but they can still get up and down the building. The tree wasn&#039;t crucial to their doing that. <br /><br />I just hope this is the end of it. I like the trees that are left. I&#039;d hate for more of them to be cut down.

There are trees all around the building. All the squirrels need is to go up a tree and jump over to a fire escape, and they can scamper about freely.

				We did it! We closed! It&#039;s been a long nine months, but we finally made it! Hahaha. Looking forward to meeting all of you as well. We won&#039;t be moving until September 21st. We&#039;re going to have some additional work done before we move (paint, shades, etc.). It really turned out amazingly well. So happy with it. Just a few odds and ends to finish up, and we&#039;ll be on our way.

The day I came to do my final walkthrough, my arm actually got snagged on it pretty badly heading back to the train. I’m fine, but I’be got what seems to be a large permanent scar now&nbsp; :( The fencing has to go. Also, as for the gate, they ARE eventually upgrading all of the buzzer systems.

				My apartment had multiple delays and I didn&#039;t close/move in until 5 months after the date I was given. My guess is that they&#039;ve gotten better at estimating since then (I was one of the earlier purchasers so maybe they&#039;ve stopped promising dates they know they can&#039;t deliver). <br /><br />Does anyone know if the work stoppage is over? There was loud music blasting from the apartment below mine last week and I know no one has moved in so I thought it might be workers (and I&#039;ve seen more dusty footprints around).

				You could just ask the management company. I think the issue is probably since water is included in the maintenance, in theory, you could be using more than your fair share. In my mom&#039;s co-op, for example, the management company tacks on an extra charge to your maintenance for a portable washer to account for the water usage.

				Re: carpeting - <br /><br />Most people just get area rugs, not installed wall-to-wall carpeting.&nbsp; The building isn&#039;t very strict about it being 80%.&nbsp; I have rugs in my dining area, living room and bedroom. Not in the hallways or kitchen.&nbsp; It&#039;s really about a noise buffer for your downstairs neighbor. If you are on the ground floor then don&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The dude above me moved in a year ago and still hasn&#039;t bothered to get any carpets and it&#039;s starting to get on my nerves.&nbsp; My ceiling light makes jingling noises every time he walks across the dining area and he puts a fan on the bedroom floor that makes my entire ceiling vibrate.&nbsp; It&#039;s ridiculously loud when he vacuums.&nbsp; I gave him a grace period but it&#039;s been a year now so I&#039;m fed up.&nbsp; Oh, and he&#039;s a heavy walker, ugh.

				Ha, I just realized only one of the photos I posted is my actual apartment (the top one that I accidentally posted sideways).&nbsp; The other one is a different unit and the wall curve is more pronounced.&nbsp; I used to go around snooping in the empty apartments while they were being renovated and must have taken photos of one with a similar floorplan. <br /><br />Joyce, thanks for posting your photo - I have a round table as well and a buffet against the part of my wall that is still straight (you&#039;ll see my wall isn&#039;t quite as curved).&nbsp; <br /><br />Noob, my former apartment in the D building had a round dining room but they made it into a 2nd bedroom and got rid of the curve to add more space for a closet.&nbsp; I think they did that with a few of the apartments. <br /><br />toque, I considered built-in seating but the placement of the ceiling light would have made it look weird.

				toque and Lilybell, what about a swag type lighting fixture to adjust light placement over a table? Just a thought. <br /><br />I love thinking about this curved wall problem. It such a unique feature. Personally, I&#039;m obsessed with banquette type, built-in seating so I cast a vote in that direction. ;) Also the NYT and their offshoot wirecutter posted this dining table guide: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/smarter-living/how-to-choose-the-right-dining-table-for-your-home.html?<br /><br />Good luck!

				Phew. Been a busy last few days! That curved wall is perfect for a round table.

There MIGHT be another one in the future. But I don&#039;t know. I know the sponsor has her eye on combining two apartments in Building B. Sixth floor I believe. But not sure if she&#039;s started on that yet.<br /><br />Although we have years of fine-tuning ahead of us, we&#039;re just about finished with rounding out our furniture.

				Hey Mr P!&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the apartments used to make your 4-bedroom is the same floorplan as mine - I guess the curved wall disappeared during the renovation/apartment combining. <br /><br />I think a get-together sounds like fun. I&#039;m embarrassed to admit I&#039;m still in the process of buying furniture even though I&#039;ve been in the apartment for a year now. I had to return all of the custom furniture I bought (which was 4 months late!) and start over (shoddy sewing on the cushions). I still need to paint a few rooms but I want to wait until I have all of my furniture so I pick the right colors. And then I can finally hang up my artwork.&nbsp; I get paralyzed by indecision (especially when choosing paint colors). But I&#039;m going credenza shopping after work today and just bought a chair from Room and Board so I&#039;m slowly getting there!<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;ve seen this - it was posted really early in the life of this thread. It&#039;s floorplans for the complex from way before the renovations. I love staring at the layouts of all of the apartments!<br /><br />http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/dlo?obj=ldpd_YR_0914_QNS_001_003&amp;size=large <br /><br />

				Is there a non-public forum for shareholders of Washington Plaza to discuss ongoing concerns and issues? I think it&#039;s a good idea to be able to have some sort of discussion and arrive at a consensus outside of board meetings (since they&#039;re rare and not everyone can attend, etc.) that can be presented to the Sponsor, who has the controlling vote for the foreseeable future, by a united front. I think individual complaints are probably less meaningful than a coalition of sorts, but I do want to minimize the amount we share here since it&#039;s public (airing out dirty laundry and all that) and I&#039;m more interested in solutions.<br /><br />I&#039;d be happy to set up an email for this purpose and manage an email group (though, not sure how to filter out imposters lol) if others are interested. <br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				Haha. I wouldn&#039;t hold your breath for a Peloton in the gym. As much sense as that would make, each bike is a (painfully) princely sum, and they explicitly say on their website that they don&#039;t do bulk discounts. Not that 2 bikes would qualify anyway. They&#039;ve supposedly also already reserved their equipment orders. Or so I was told back in 2016, before we decided to buy.<br /><br />No details on the shareholders meeting; just that it&#039;ll take place in April.

				UGH. Jackhammering in the courtyard has begun again this morning. <br /><br />Months ago, the sidewalks in the courtyard were redone—incorrectly. Something about the specs, like the widths of the walkways, was wrong. So those weeks of noise and inconvenience we endured were for absolutely nothing, because it&#039;s all being done all over again.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious about a couple of things. First, does anyone know why the walkways were redone in the first place? I hadn&#039;t noticed any cracks or other problems. Was there actually anything <em>wrong</em> with them? Or was it just cosmetic, like the windowsills? <br /><br />Second, does anyone know how the entire job was done to the wrong specs before anybody noticed?<br />

				I think it was partially cosmetics, partially just old and cracking. There was some cracking here and there. Nothing too intense, but those kind of things generally get worse over time. As for how it was botched the first time, didn’t know it had to do with incorrect specs, so much so that it just looks like crap, even though it’s a brand new job.

				They didn&#039;t deliver on what they promised and they messed up the actual pour. They knew it was going badly early on but I think the problem was that they had already paid them for at least half of the work so they allowed them to finish (I&#039;m not positive about this - I can&#039;t remember exact details). The worst part is that they did a lot of research and hired a company that has great ratings and came highly recommended. But they sent their B-Team for this job. I forgot and tried to enter in the front yesterday and wow, that sure was a lot of rubble!&nbsp; <br /><br />Weird question - I have a wide archway that separates my living room from the dining area.

				Hey 7 - <br /><br />That is correct.&nbsp; Access to the basement is restricted overnight.<br /><br />I have only had one instance in the last year where are all the washing machines were full and I had to come back at another time....and that was only because it looked one person was doing six weeks worth of laundry and filled up every machine.&nbsp; Usually, there is at least one machine available.

				My luck with the machines being available is not as good as JacksonHeightsCPA&#039;s. I just need one washer/one dryer, and there are times I go down and not even one washer is available. Or my washing is done but the dryers are all full. <br /><br />Of course, there are two laundry rooms. If there&#039;s nothing free in one, you can trek over to the other one—you might luck out.<br /><br />BTW, the basement (including laundry rooms) closes at 9:00 p.m. When the courtyard sidewalks were being redone and we couldn&#039;t enter our buildings that way, the basement was open all night, with guys stationed at two doors to let people in. You could do your laundry late at night, and you could come in through the side doors if you got home after 9, rather than walking around to the front. It was fun while it lasted.

				My experience has been the same as with other buildings. No real issue - as long as you don&#039;t wait to do a month of laundry and try to get in at prime time.

				I think the basement hours will have to increase when the gym is finished. 6am seems early, but it&#039;s really not when you consider a 45 minute workout and then having to go shower before work. I don&#039;t think it makes any difference to simply change the elevator timer so we can go down a 5am instead of 6am. Honestly, I think keeping the basement locked between midnight - 5:00 am would be reasonable.

				Thanks everyone for the laundry info!<br /><br />Apparently it is not possible for every apartment to have an internal laundry, due to the contract with the shared laundry company in the basement (Hercules laundry corp (https://www.yelp.com/biz/hercules-corp-hicksville)?) that artificially limits the number of internal laundries in the building

				Where did you hear that?&nbsp; That&#039;s not the reason. <br /><br />The building cannot handle the water pressure from multiple washers and dryers and we would have soapy water backing up into our sinks. There are no hookups and it would have to replace your dishwasher.&nbsp; It&#039;s the reason you don&#039;t see individual washers and dryers in most pre-war buildings.<br /><br />Only the 3 and 4 bedrooms have them (there are only a few apartments that large so it doesn&#039;t cause problems. But it&#039;s not feasible for 194 apartments).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, even if it were possible logistically, it would increase our maintenance fees because of huge increases in the water bill - and we&#039;d have to absorb the bill from all of the stabilized tenants. <br /><br />

				The agent fed you a line of BS. My agent lied to me about the bathroom flooring during the buying process.

				Maybe silly question, but does the sponsor control the board at Washington Plaza, at least until more apartments are sold? Or are the residents running the board now?<br /><br />Asking because I&#039;m a bit curious, if residents are running the board now, then why allow some residents to have washing machines while not allowing others to? I mean, if the issue is the old pipes, then the board could decide to fix the pipes, right? Or, the board could even decide to ban all washing machines, in order to be &quot;fairer&quot; for everyone, right?

				The sponsor didn&#039;t promise something and then reneg on it - the only apartments with laundry are the ones that were two apartments that were merged into one - they were massive gut renos so they were able to add laundry hook-ups. They were added as a selling-point to the very largest units (I don&#039;t know the exact number - maybe 4 or 5 units?). It&#039;s not like they always had laundry and no one else did - it only happened with the gut renovations. <br /><br />The other apartments were never advertised to have in-unit laundry and I think it&#039;s even in the contract that we can&#039;t have them.<br /><br />The building just can&#039;t handle the water pressure it would take to have laundry hookups in every apartment - it would be a sudsy mess. And like I wrote in an earlier comment, I sure as hell don&#039;t want higher maintenance fees&nbsp; - we&#039;d have to eat the cost for the renters as well. <br /><br />The cost to modernize the piping system would be prohibitive. It&#039;s the reason you don&#039;t see pre-war buildings with in-unit laundry - it&#039;s just not feasible. The pipes at Washington Plaza were modernized about 5 years ago - but adding laundry hook-ups is a whole other ballgame.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, the laundry room hours really don&#039;t affect things all that much. I do laundry at around 6 or 7 am on weekends and I rarely even see another human.&nbsp; I can only think of two times when I had to come back later because the room was full (that&#039;s two times in 11 years).&nbsp; <br /><br />If it&#039;s something you absolutely need then you&#039;d probably have better luck with post-war buildings.

				I admit the board control issue confuses me. We&#039;ve always been told that we will gain control once 51% of the units are sold and I think we just hit that mark. But we all chose to vote for the CFO of the owner&#039;s management company to be on the board at our last meeting - so we are actually helping her keep control. However, I have been happy with her decisions so far; Washington Plaza is her &quot;baby&quot; and she truly cares about the complex (and the CFO knows his stuff).

				“Her” is Marilyn. The face of the sponsor group. She’s pretty much the one leading it all, and it’s by understanding that her family has owned the building for many years. As far as ownership goes, I think folks are forgetting that the rental units are still under sponsor control. I thought those count as ownership. I believe 51% of all the units in the building need to be sold, and there are still a lot of rental units.<br /><br />As for that new 3BR. Looks pretty sweet. Love how unique of a layout it is.

				Would be nice to get a status update on the hallways since we are in the 3rd quarter. The end of the year with all the non-working holidays will be here before we know it. I need the gym for health reasons and would be disappointed if it were further delayed given they&#039;ll be juggling the construction and sales of new units. Does anyone know?

				51 percent should happen soon. i hope it does. i bought a sponsor apartment in the Warwick back in 2002, and the by-laws in place then required a two-thirds majority to control the board. the sponsor wasn&#039;t terrible, but hired itself in every possible position, so the self-dealing was kind of annoying.

				Interesting, that floorplan with the w/d hookup is not a combined unit. I think the woman who lived there had the apartment for more than 50 years - some of those long term tenants installed illegal w/d hookups. I bet the owner decided it was worth keeping the hookup for the next buyer. It&#039;s a huge apartment and the tenant was quite the hoarder; I feel sorry for whoever had to clear it out.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I doubt they will start the gym for about a year. They wildly underestimate the timing for everything. At least they are moving it to a bigger location than originally planned - it&#039;s going to be in the large trash room outside of the D-building elevator. The contractors store tons of stuff in there so we won&#039;t have access to it until they are done with the hallway and exterior renovations. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been investigating area gyms while we wait and I&#039;ve been underwhelmed by the options. I&#039;ve been making do at home with a TRX system (I hook it over my door) and free weights and a barbell. Thank goodness for the ample closet space in Washington Plaza.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Re: FiOS, I gave Verizon a call and they said that Washington Plaza still had copper lines and that they had not even begun installing FiOS yet. <br /><br />The Verizon representative said that they were not even sure if enough residents wanted FiOS, and that more residents would have to contact Verizon first. After making a decision to install FiOS, it would then take 6-12 months to complete. So maybe 2020? <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what the real FiOS status is (this seems inconsistent with some of the earlier comments), but that is what the Verizon representative told me on the phone.

There&#039;s a google group. But the groups are separate - one for owners, one for renters. This is the only place where we can all talk. <br /><br />Regarding the laundry room - that has happened to me a few times as well and it&#039;s annoying. I now do my laundry at 6am and tend to have the place to myself. There are a few people who don&#039;t wait for the dryers to finish - I always set a timer and am never late so it cheeses me off when people open my dryer. I don&#039;t like people touching my clothes. <br /><br />I just looked at the photos of the un-renovated rental unit. The owner must have lived there for quite some time because the kitchen is pretty outdated. I moved in 12 years ago and my kitchen was much nicer; they updated the apartments back then as people moved out (I don&#039;t mean the current renovations; I mean they just got nicer cabinets, wood floors, fake granite counters and a decent-looking sink and no yellow tile). The one for rent did not get one of those updates and still has the old cabinets and lighting.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great layout.

Since the maintenance is already high, this could be a $100-$200 increase in your monthly maintenance.

				Most recent example I can think of is Tuesday night 2 weeks ago (maybe 3 weeks) where the washers in the ABC laundry were acting up (displaying errors, stopping cycles early) so we went to the DEF laundry instead, but then the dryers there weren&#039;t starting.<br /><br />We didn&#039;t try every machine that night, it wasn&#039;t clear whether the broken machines were still charging us or whether we would get refunds for them.<br /><br />There was a big storm that night, that might have affected the machines somehow?

				My understanding is that Delta will allow it but that Verizon only sent the paperwork to Delta in February of this year. Verizon said they also tried to send paperwork in 2016 but they didn&#039;t hear back from Delta then.<br /><br />At this point I think we are just waiting for Verizon. But if you file a 311 complaint about FiOS being unavailable you may learn some new info.

				I spoke to the FIOS installer today. There are two more weeks of work to do. That could take up to a month. <br /><br />The cable installation will take another week. Then, the &quot;splicing guys&quot; will come (when they can fit it into their schedule).
