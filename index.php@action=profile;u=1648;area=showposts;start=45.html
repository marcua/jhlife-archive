					Regardless of what was there at the time of designation, once you remove and then replace it, the new fence (in this case) must first be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.&nbsp; If you fail to have your proposal approved IN ADVANCE of doing the work, and this change is reported to the LPC, and if this change is in violation of LPC rules, THEN they will issue a violation to the property owner.&nbsp; The property owner has the right to legalize this change.&nbsp; However, in most cases (that I have seen at least) the change is not in accordance with LPC rules and will not be legalized.&nbsp; Then the property owner has undo the work done, or leave it there until they decide to sell or refinance the property.&nbsp; Since lenders want all violations removed (include LPC violations), the property cannot close if a lender is involved.&nbsp; So, there are people who have violations sitting on their fence, window, door, etc. changes for years.&nbsp; This happens in every historic district across the city.&nbsp; It is demoralizing for the property owners who do the right thing from the start.&nbsp; But the rules are the rules.&nbsp; So it does not matter to the LPC what other property owners have or have not done on the block.&nbsp; If there is a violation on the property, it will be handled according to their rules and process.

					If you would like to become a subscriber to my quarterly report on all residential real estate transactions in Jackson Heights (11372 zip code), please visit my website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Please contact me should you have any real estate needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dan Karatzas...<br /><br />Hello and Happy New Year!<br /><br />2015 was a very good year for real estate in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Record prices were achieved in virtually every category of residential real estate.&nbsp; For houses, sales volume was down, due to so few properties coming to market.&nbsp; For the full year, average sales prices climbed 21.7% to $857,733 for one-family houses, and 7.2% to $870,737 for two-family houses.&nbsp; Three-family houses saw their average sales price decline by 16.8% to $905,833.&nbsp; Three one-family houses sold for over $1 million.&nbsp; &nbsp;Two were properties with commercial potential, the third was one of the largest English Garden Homes on 86th Street, and closed at $1.33 million.&nbsp; While many two-family houses sold in the $900s, the one that closed at $1.3 million on 72nd Street will likely be used as part of a new residential development.<br /><br />Apartment sales climbed by 10.8% to 482 units, up in all categories except prewar elevator cooperatives.&nbsp; Average sales prices rose between 6.7% and 16.1% in the four categories: to $226,233 for postwar elevator cooperatives, $339,453 for prewar elevator cooperatives, $363,480 for prewar walkup cooperatives, and $391,947 for condominiums.<br /><br />Records were broken at many of the original garden cooperatives:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1.075 million for the largest four-bedroom, three-bath at The Towers<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$865,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath at Hawthorne Court<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$695,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath at Hawthorne Court<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$542,500 for a two-bedroom, one-bath at Hampton Court<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$405,000 for a one-bedroom at Hampton Court<br /><br />At prewar cooperatives (converted in the 1980s):<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$637,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath at Fillmore Hall<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$603,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath at The Berkeley<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$401,500 for a one-bedroom at The Berkeley<br /><br />At postwar cooperatives:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$405,000 for a three-bedroom, one-bath at Roosevelt Terrace<br /><br />And condominiums:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$692,410 for a two-bedroom at Stratford Hall<br /><br />Finally, as you probably are aware, Jackson Heights has received much media attention of the last year or so:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of four “The Hunt” columns in the New York Times real estate section<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “Block by Block” video (in which I appear!) also on the New York Times’ website<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A profile in the Wall Street Journal<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A documentary by Frederick Wiseman<br /><br />We’ll see what 2016 has in store as the year proceeds.&nbsp; Again, should you have any real estate needs, please do not hesitate to contact me.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br />Cell: 646 285 7762<br /><a href="http://www.beaudoinrealty.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.beaudoinrealty.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br /><br /><br />

					The bishop&#039;s crook black street lamps were installed when John Sabini was our City Councilman, so we are going back over ten years.&nbsp; They did the mid-block lamps along 37th Avenue and the ones on 82 Street.&nbsp; But then it stopped.<br />You should contact Councilmember Dromm&#039;s office with your suggestion.&nbsp; I think the focus would be on 37th Avenue rather than the side streets.<br />I did notice that LED lighting was installed along 35th Avenue recently.

					qwfx - there is hope.<br /><br />I stumbled upon a new fruit merchant in front of American Chicken, 78-07 37 Avenue.&nbsp; I asked inside if she was associated with the store, and got no response.&nbsp; I reported to 311 every day I saw her.&nbsp; I also reported this to Councilmember Dromm&#039;s office.&nbsp; His office did contact the 115th precinct, which is where the 311 complaints go to.&nbsp; I did the 311 route so I had proof that complaints were made, so the NYPD could not claim that no one had complained.&nbsp; I did that for about 5 days.&nbsp; As of today, the cement-filled plastic bucket (into which the umbrellas were fitted) is now gone.&nbsp; I live around the corner and was ready to call every day until it was history.&nbsp; If she returns, the complaints will start again.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that is what it takes for the merchants to get the message.<br /><br />While the commercial district does look better, many merchants, especially those who allow this in front of their place of business, leave a lot to be desired.&nbsp; Yes, I know commercial rents are high, but maybe they should aim a bit higher with their merchandise and make their places of business more inviting and presentable.&nbsp; That may increase sales, rather than allowing fruit sellers in front.

					Stew:<br /><br />I walked by the building this morning, and if you look at the Isabel (the haircutter) sign, you can see the black and green marble sign band behind the sign.&nbsp; Hopefully it is still there on yours.&nbsp; I would think it is, unless Baskin Robbins removed it 30+ years ago... It cost money to remove the thing, so I imagine most merchants simply covered over what was there.<br /><br />

					Stew:<br /><br />Many people have been commenting on the inside.. here is my two cents on the outside.&nbsp; I am almost certain that you will remove the ugly light-box sign above the horrible illuminated sign/awning/box.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, that lovely limestone building has a black and green marble sign band above the show window.&nbsp; It may still be there behind that awful sign/awning. I think the lettering (for the store name) was originally in gold, and the stores likely had a canvas awning projecting from below the sign band.&nbsp; I know you are likely sandwiched between huge and garish signs and awnings, but perhaps you can be the start of the resurrection of this commercial building - by installing a sign and awning that befit the building and your business.&nbsp; It may be worth a shot to see if the sign band is still there after all these years, and use it if it is somewhat intact.&nbsp; I know you have your hands full with starting up a business, but maybe we can get some concerned Hawthorne Ct residents to reach out to the property owner and see if he can have his (non-landmarked, unfortunately) commercial tenants install uniform signs and awnings that will enhance, rather than detract, both their business and the value of his building.&nbsp; One can only hope that this is a start.....&nbsp; I predict success for you.

					You are going back and forth over two different four-room Towers apartments.&nbsp; The one on the first floor was in terrible condition and closed at $230,000.&nbsp; Another one on the fourth floor closed at $405,000.&nbsp; The one in the pictures is another listing, I believe on the second floor, priced at $519,000.&nbsp; <br /><br />One seven-room line in this same building was divided into two apartment in the 1930s: one is a three room with the fireplace, the other is a four room that has two bathrooms.&nbsp; These very rarely turn over, but in less than one year three came to market.&nbsp; Just coincidence.

					Congratulations!<br /><br />When I was a kid, this was the site of Arnold&#039;s Pharmacy. Just a bit of nostalgia.<br /><br />I have said for the last few years that if you want to open a successful business in Jackson Heights, open a non-ethnic, non-diner restaurant.&nbsp; A place you can take mom to on Mother&#039;s Day, something not too fancy, but pleasant... places that exist in other neighborhoods but, up to now, not ours.&nbsp; I predict success.

					Hello,<br /><br />I have just issued my third quarter 2014 Jackson Heights Real Estate Report.&nbsp; You can always obtain a copy of the latest report, and subscribe to future reports, by going to: <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is a brief overview of the results:<br /><br />For houses, sales were flat – for both the current quarter and year-to-date results.&nbsp; &nbsp;Average sales prices are indeed higher, as demand outstrips supply.&nbsp; Most telling are the year-to date numbers, with average sales prices up between 9% and 17% versus 2013.&nbsp; In the third quarter I sold a beautifully maintained 1920s two-family house (outside the Historic District) for $1 million (all right, it was $999,000 to escape the mansion tax).&nbsp; There were about ten offers in less than one week.&nbsp; Two three-family houses sold for similar amounts this year as well.&nbsp; However,with few comparables, appraisals can still be a problem.<br /><br />While unit sales of apartments were below the prior and year-ago quarters (again not accounting for closings in the last 10 days of the quarter), average sales prices were up across the board.&nbsp; Year-to-date unit sales were higher, a strong indicator of current market strength.&nbsp; And year to date, average sales prices were up between 5.7% (for prewar walkup coops) and 10.4% for (prewar elevator coops).&nbsp; <br /><br />The last few months saw record prices realized at a number of the original garden apartment complexes: $915,000 for a seven-room at the Towers, and $805,000 for a seven-room at the Chateau.&nbsp; A six-room at Hampton Court closed at $580,000, a five-room at Hawthorne Court at $625,000 and, finally, a six-room at Hawthorne Court for $750,000.<br /><br />With that said inventory remains very low, as are mortgage rates.&nbsp; <br /><br />[Again, the City truncated September’s results, leaving off the last ten days of the month, so the actual results for apartments are likely to be a bit higher than what is seen here.&nbsp; I will revise the third quarter numbers for the fourth quarter report.]<br /><br /><br />Please contact me should you have any real estate needs, plus referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br />Cell: 646 285 7762<br /><br /><a href="http://www.beaudoinrealty.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.beaudoinrealty.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br />

					A few months ago, for sale on ebay, was a vintage news photo of Whitey and Mrs. Ford in their Jackson Heights apartment. So, it is indeed true.

					Jackson Heights native Michele Beaudoin, of Beaudoin Realty Group, was the real estate professional who helped make this happen.&nbsp; She reached out to both Frank and the owner and facilitated the meeting of the minds that made this possible. Thanks Michele!

					I emailed our congressman, Joseph Crowley, to get his response, when this issue appeared two weeks ago on a journalist&#039;s video tour of sex slavery/prostitution on Roosevelt Avenue...&nbsp; the video showing one of the brothels in the rear basement of a house on 79th Street between Roosevelt and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; His office called me back; I returned their call today, but the person was not in. Still waiting.<br /><br />I suggest you do likewise... go to all of our elected&#039;s websites... all of which ask you to communicate with them.&nbsp; The more that complain the greater likelihood of some action.&nbsp; ASK THEM WHY CAN&#039;T THEY END PROSTITUTION AND SEX SLAVERY IN OUR MIDST!<br /><br />Precisely why is it that this situation is allowed to fester for years?&nbsp; It is the same Avenue, with the same buildings on or near it.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t law enforcement figure this out?&nbsp; What prevents them from ending this criminal enterprise?&nbsp; Bribes, stupidity, overly-liberal political correctness?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get it.&nbsp; This has been going on for years.....&nbsp; CONTACT YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TODAY.&nbsp; REFER TO THE DNA INFO ARTICLE.&nbsp; At least Sen. Peralta has focused on this.<br /><br /><strong>[Moderator Note:&nbsp; This post has been merged to this thread.&nbsp; Similar topic.]</strong><br />
