				Try, try again...<br /><br />Does anybody have a recommendation for a doctor?<br /><br />My primary care physician retired, and I&#039;m long overdue for a checkup.<br /><br />But more urgently, I could really benefit from somebody able to take a look at this nasty bug I have.&nbsp; I had an appointment today with a doctor at Western Queens Health Associates (the mega-practice at 82nd &amp; 37th), but I couldn&#039;t bear to sit for the two hours they were running behind schedule.&nbsp; I guess tomorrow I&#039;m going to a walk-in clinic.&nbsp; Still, it would be nice to find a good, well-run local practice.<br /><br />

				bumping this up because I&#039;ve been sick for a couple days and don&#039;t know who to go to.&nbsp; Is there a walk-in clinic around here (I&#039;m on 74th near 34th)?&nbsp; I called the Jackson Heights Family Health Center and the doctor there doesn&#039;t take my insurance.&nbsp; Then I called a doctor&#039;s office that is around the corner from me but they don&#039;t have office hours today.&nbsp; So now it&#039;s getting late in the day and I probably won&#039;t be able to get in anywhere.<br />Anybody have any advice?<br />thanks!

				There&#039;s a large practice with a walk-in clinic at Western Queens Health Associates, 82-01 37th Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I recently made an appointment with one of their doctors, but when I got there, they were running 2+ hours behind schedule, and I finally gave up and left.&nbsp; If you hit the walk-in clinic early in the morning, you might have better luck.<br /><br />Feel better!

				I don&#039;t have any firsthand experience with this place, but if you are well enough to go to Manhattan, there are a few walk-in clinics at Duane Reades in Manhattan.&nbsp; There&#039;s one at 50th and Broadway that&#039;s open til 8pm 7 days a week.&nbsp; I imagine you&#039;d have to wait if you go to a walk-in clinic anywhere.&nbsp; I even have to wait for awhile at my doctors office when I&#039;ve booked an appointment a month in advance!<br /><br />http://www.drwalkin.com/locations.html

				Note to anyone who might try to go to WQHA on the weekend - they don&#039;t have any doctors there on the weekend, and they will look at you like you&#039;re an idiot when you ask about it.

				I&#039;m bumping this back up to see whether anybody, maybe our newer members here, have recs for a local dr (just within Jackson Heights).&nbsp; My normal dr is by my work in Manhattan, but that doesn&#039;t help me right now with my bout of food poisoning.&nbsp; You really need a local dr sometimes, especially when you&#039;re talking minutes between bathroom runs!&nbsp; Sorry...TMI.&nbsp; I&#039;m not keen on scouring the Aetna listings blindly, since there are a lot of quacks out there.&nbsp; I&#039;m also looking for someone that I can keep as my local dr even after this is over. The walk-in clinics won&#039;t work for me because of the waiting time.&nbsp; Anyone?

				I&#039;m glad you&#039;re feeling better!<br /><br />Go to know Gould&#039;s still in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I visited his practice under similar circumstances to yours -- I was sick several years ago, and was able to schedule a last-minute appointment with him.&nbsp; He was very nice and helpful.&nbsp; But I never followed up with a routine appointment, so I may not have made it into his records as a regular patient.

				I was hoping that I just had a regular cough, but after a miserable week, it appears I may have some kind of respiratory infection.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a local walk-in clinic where I can receive treatment and get a prescription?&nbsp; I have insurance (aetna) and it would be nice if they took it, but at this point, I just want to find somewhere I can get in and out of quickly that is nearby.

				You could try Western Queens Health Associates.&nbsp; They have several clinics in the building on the north side of 37th Avenue, between 82nd and 83rd.&nbsp; I went there once but gave up after waiting for an hour.&nbsp; Perhaps if you go early in the AM you&#039;ll have better luck.<br /><br />I hope you feel better soon!

				Thanks for the info. I ended up going to Rapid Medical Care in Astoria (Broadway, between 33rd and 34th Street).&nbsp; I went around 2pm and there were only 2 other people in there.&nbsp; I only waited about 5 minutes before being seen.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t accept my insurance, so the cost of the visit was $75 and then since they didn&#039;t take my insurance, the doctor sent me to another place in Astoria to get a chest x-ray taken.

				A friend went to and liked this urgent care clinic on Northern Blvd in Flushing<br />http://northernurgent.com/<br /><br />And out of curiosity, I briefly stopped in to see the new urgent care facility that shares a parking lot with the Stop and Shop in Maspeth<br />http://www.premiercaredoc.com/<br />I can&#039;t recommend it one way or the other except to say it looked clean and new.
