				Driving around tonight while looking for parking I noticed that the west side of 74th St between 37th &amp; 34th Aves is now no parking 7am-7pm M-F. I’m assuming this is to help traffic flow on 74th Street. Does anyone know anything about this change and whether other parking reductions are coming our way?

				I noticed the signs today too.&nbsp; They cover an area of about three car lengths just before hydrant. I couldn&#039;t make any sense out of it either.

				It’s a double sided arrow, though, so I think it applies to the whole block, maybe? I won’t risk it!

				It probably has to do with the bus routes on 74th. The buses get held up by double parked cars. Probably it is needed on 75th street on the same avenues to speed up the buses. It is already done on 82nd street. They also could be putting in bike lanes.

				The signs are still up in our neighborhood, and the article says it will continue in other neighborhoods. I drove down 74th this morning from 37th to Northern around 8:30 and saw at least 6 cars with boots. Six! They can’t al be for excessive parking tickets. Folks who live on 74th, have you noticed a change (e.g., less honking, fewer backups) since the new signs have gone up?

				What a failure of NYC DOT to not let people know. Ridiculous really.

				I don’t believe that it’s the entire stretch from 37th to 34th. I can only speak on 37th to 35th Ave, where I live, but I only ever recall seeing these signs covering the distance of a few spots close to the corner of 37th Ave.

				They should have communicated this better, but getting rid of on street parking on that stretch is absolutely the right thing to do.&nbsp;

				Just a heads up, today I noticed that on the east side of 75th Street btw 35th &amp; 37th Aves there&#039;s another one of these no parking 7a - 7p sections. It&#039;s about 3 car lengths long. It should help alleviate some of the congestion on that block. There was no warning that this sign was going up, though, and there were still cars parked there that had their wipers pointing up from last week&#039;s snow. I hope they don&#039;t get towed!
