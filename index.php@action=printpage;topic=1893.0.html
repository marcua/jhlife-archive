				The last two JH&#039;s Cooperatives that I lived in didn&#039;t allow pets.&nbsp; I&#039;m now living in one that does.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never owned a cat so would appreciate comments/recommendations from cat owners.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m a senior, I&#039;m leaning toward an older cat.&nbsp; I&#039;m living in a large one bedroom that is cat friendly.&nbsp; Its on a low floor facing a beautiful garden with very wide windowsills.&nbsp; I use the shower stall so the unused bath tub would be perfect for the litter box.&nbsp; The 18 ft long kitchen will easily accomodate an area for food &amp; water. <br /><br />Most important is a healthy diet which I plan to research before adopting.&nbsp; I did a quick search and found a company called Wysong.Com which has organic pet food made with all natural ingedients.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; What about supplements?&nbsp; Should I purchase a cat bed or let it sleep where it wants?&nbsp; Do cat require professional grooming?&nbsp; <br /><br />I know that there&#039;s an Animal Center located in Rego Park.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also looked at the site Petfinder.com.&nbsp; I won&#039;t be ready until late January (planning some renovations) but would like to plan now.&nbsp; Any imput would be appreciate.&nbsp; I&#039;m really looking forward to sharing this home with someone who needs one.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

				Adopting an older cat has pros and cons.&nbsp; On the upside you will know its temperment and they are not as active.&nbsp; But older cats can, but not always, need more vet care.&nbsp; I work with a rescuer who&#039;s name is Sandra and if you would like more detailed information about cat adoption and ownership please call her at 718 204 7339.&nbsp; If you adopt from her, she will always take them back should it not work out and her rescues are vet checked and healthy.&nbsp; Good luck and thanks for adopting.

				All of my cats have been adopted as kittens (two were only 5 weeks old and the other was about 6 months at adoption). I would say that the 6 month old was a model of his true personality and would therefore recommend this age for adoption. You need to understand what you are looking for - playful, friendly, lap-cat, etc. <br /><br />I am unsure if you can get an &quot;older&quot; cat to adapt to your home and wishes. This is something to research also. You definitely would want a cat that is not too independent and would not interact with you. You really need to think about what you want. <br /><br />I have one cat who likes to be played with for a few moments and then runs off. She will &quot;talk&quot; to me at times. However, there are definitely times when she doesn&#039;t want to be bothered with and will even get angry at me. She is also not great with visitors. She thinks she is the boss of who can come in and visit.<br /><br />While, my other cat (the one who recently passed away) loved company - even delivery people. He wanted to be rubbed and petted. He would lie down next to me to watch TV and then nap. He was so sweet and even &quot;bumped heads&quot; (it&#039;s a greeting and sort of hug). Sometimes, he would get under my blanket at night and sleep with me. He was a real lap cat with me and friends. (We really miss him).<br /><br />Cats are wonderful. Think about what you want and go for it. My way is to visit with many places looking for a pet to adopt (or the same place over and over again) until I find the one who <em>steals my heart <em>. <br /><br />Good luck.</em></em>

				Earbears:&nbsp; Thanks for posting.&nbsp; I&#039;m very new at this so I need to become educated.&nbsp; Your message has helped.&nbsp; This is why I plan to speak to many long term cat owners.&nbsp; The reason why I mentioned an older Cat is that I&#039;m 68 years old.&nbsp; I&#039;m active, in good health but I don&#039;t know what tomorrow will bring.&nbsp; I know someone who is 84 years old who has a young 3 year old.&nbsp; This was not a wise decision but he was talked into it by a neighbor who needed to place cats.&nbsp; Even if I adopted an older cat that wanted little interaction this would be fine.&nbsp; I would be pleased just to know that this older cat will live out their life in comfort in a nice home versus a shelter.&nbsp; Again, thanks.<br /><br />

				Long-haired cats need grooming, while short-hair cats do not.<br /><br />For my cat, I buy Eagle Pack Holistic Select Anchovy cat food, which is available online. Here is a website where you can find reviews of cat food<br /><br />http://www.consumersearch.com/cat-food/reviews<br /><br />You should try NYC Animal Care and Control for adoption. They are located in Brooklyn. They have many older cats. Here is their website<br /><br />http://www.nycacc.org

				WRT your cat bed question: my mom&#039;s cat always liked sleeping in cardboard boxes more than anything else. My mom would buy it all these nice beds that never got used. I would buy something inexpensive until you learn the cat&#039;s preferences so you don&#039;t waste your money... and stock up on cardboard boxes!

				Dear Mike,<br /><br />As a person rapidly approaching &quot;seniorhood&quot; myself, I have adopted senior cats&nbsp; and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I spearheaded an event called &quot;Seniors for Seniors&quot; , sponsored by a rescue organization called Kitty Kind, that always has many wonderful felines available for adoption at Petco, Union Square.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have&nbsp; a few &quot;adoption counselors&quot; who will match you with the perfect kitty.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cats older than 5 years are already considered &quot;unadoptable&quot; by many shelters and since many cats live to be at least 15-20 years. with a bit of luck and good care&nbsp; these lovely &quot;unadoptables&quot;&nbsp; have many more good years in their lives.&nbsp; I even adopted a 16 year-old boy-cat, who was truly the sweetest creature I ever met.<br /><br />I agree that, depending upon their age, they may have more veterinary expenses than a youngster but, if your cat does not go outdoors, I do not recommend vaccinating, which is mostly what Vets do when they see an animal regularly.&nbsp; It is unnecessary and even detrimental to their health.<br /><br />I would be happy to discuss healthy diet or any other issues that may come up.&nbsp; &nbsp; Good luck in choosing a companion.&nbsp; You will not regret it.<br /><br />Madalyn

				Mike,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve had cats for a long time and most of them were adopted as kittens or rescued in their first year.&nbsp; I would probably avoid any cat less than 3 years old as they have an abundance of energy in the early years and their curiosity can take its toll on you.&nbsp; Senior cats can also have issues - they can be set it their ways and be totally resentful at a new home and &quot;parent&quot; no matter how good you are.&nbsp; What it really comes down to is personality.&nbsp; Look around and find one that suits your personality.&nbsp; Let it be known that if the personality doesn&#039;t fit, you will be returning the cat.&nbsp; That&#039;s the only way to be sure that you and the cat are happy.&nbsp; As far as nutrition, I&#039;ve never found anything wrong with the well-known brands. I&#039;ve had cats that live for 10-12 years and I also had a calico that lived to be 24 - all on brand name cat food and no supplements.&nbsp; As far as beds, most cats will find their own &quot;nest&quot; but the older ones prefer a place that shelters them from drafts.&nbsp; I bought a clamshell nest a few years ago, and our oldest (13) loves that.&nbsp; Good luck in your search. There are good pet people on this forum, so feel free to post your questions.<br /><br /><br />

				Mike V,<br />I was so happy to read about your wish to adopt an adult cat. I adopted an adult cat from North Shore Animal League 3 years ago and she has changed my life!<br /><br />I&#039;m bothered by the attitude that you can return your cat to the shelter if your personalities don&#039;t match. For several months I didn&#039;t get along with my cat, Congee. I had grown up with an extremely affectionate cat who would follow me around the neighborhood as I was dogwalking. I could also hold her for long periods of time without her getting antsy. Congee, my new adopted cat, was so different that it drove it crazy. (My partner tells me Congee was just being a cat.)<br /><br />I put up with her (or, she put up with me) and now I can&#039;t imagine my life without her. Thank god I didn&#039;t let her go just because we didn&#039;t get along for the first few months. It seems wrong to take on a new member of the family into your home, then to kick her out.<br /><br />As for food, the best food is not canned or packaged but food *you* make. If you&#039;re inclined &amp; have the time, look up some of the recipes. I buy canned but know it&#039;s not the best nutrition for Congee.<br /><br />Please do let us know once you adopt about your cat how you&#039;re doing! <br />

				Hi Mike, <br /><br />I actually just joined JacksonHeightsLife and was thrilled to see your post! I live in the neighborhood and have an 8 year old cat that I have to find a new home for. I adopted Bunny about 5 years ago and he is incredibly loving. Just the most affectionate cat I&#039;ve ever met: loves to be picked up and held, will sit in my lap for hours, etc. I hate to give him up but unfortunately, Bunny does not get along at all with my fiance, and thus I need to find him a new home. In fact I&#039;ve really been hoping to find a senior or someone who works from home because Bunny is such a social cat. <br /><br />The details are that though he was a originally found on the street he is of the Manx breed, which means he just has a little nub for a tail (hence his name). He is a shorthair and has very dark brown fur, which looks black except in sunlight. Quite striking actually!&nbsp; He&#039;s in good health and has been an indoor cat ever since I got him. The vet I&#039;ve been using is great and located right&nbsp; on 37th avenue (Dr. Tello at Noah&#039;s Ark). I know you won&#039;t be ready until January but do you think you might be interested? I can get back to you with a link to some pictures.

				Yes, you are correct that she didn&#039;t *have* to give a reason and she did. It&#039;s also a public message board where people can give their opinions on items posted.<br /><br />Having rescued several cats and kittens (most abandoned) from the streets, etc. myself, it sucks to see someone giving up a supposedly well loved animal for such a shoddy reason.&nbsp; When you adopt an animal, you adopt it for its lifetime, not till something better comes along. <br /><br />I&#039;m really not trying to start an argument, it just makes me sad to read things like that and I couldn&#039;t sit back and shut up about it.

				Mike,<br /><br />I saw on NY1 yesterday that in December and January the ASPCA is offering free adoptions of cats 3 years and older.&nbsp; &nbsp;They also had a bit about the Center for Animal Care and Control (CACC), but I missed it.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the place to most directly, and quite literally, save a life!&nbsp; They have adoption centers in Brooklyn and Manhattan as far as I know.<br /><br />Wherever you adopt your cat from, ask them to show you how to clip its claws (assuming it hasn&#039;t been declawed of course).&nbsp; Also, and this may seem obvious, but for a new owner I would say generally speaking friendlier cats are easier to care for than shy ones (i.e. ones that like to hide).<br /><br />Good luck!

				Hi, Mike.<br />Are you still looking for a cat to adopt?&nbsp; I used to rescue kittens in our common garden here in JH.&nbsp; A former student adopted two of these kittens.&nbsp; They are now four and six, both males and both very sweet.&nbsp; Sadly, due to some family problems, she must find a new home/ homes for her cats.&nbsp; If you would be interested in adopting two, that would be great since they&#039;ve been together four years. If you only want one, that is okay.<br />Hope to hear from you.<br />Lydston

				Being an older person myself, I always adopt older cats - especially because everyone wants babies and the shelters have a hard time finding homes for older cats.&nbsp; They have all been lovely creatures and <span class="bbc_u">very </span> grateful to have a second chance with someone who appreciates them.&nbsp; A good shelter (I am fond of Kitty Kind at Union Square in Petco) will give you lots of help at choosing the right cat for you.&nbsp; They know the personalities (catalities?)&nbsp; and habits of their cats and they will steer you right.&nbsp; I always have two cats so they keep each other company when you&#039;re not around.<br /><br />For healthy diet information, I would refer you to a book by Richard Pitcairn, DVM.&nbsp; I forget the exact name of the book - something like Natural Care for Dogs and Cats, but if you Google it.....&nbsp; He was one of the first holistic Vets and he really is a pioneer in the field.&nbsp; Wysong is a good food but it&#039;s expensive and sometimes cats don&#039;t like it.&nbsp; You can get a good quality canned food (dry food is not recommended for older cats because of kidney issues) or you can make your own.&nbsp; The Pitcairn book has a wealth of&nbsp; info. about food, supplements, etc.<br /><br />Any time you feel like talking with someone about cat&nbsp; care, let me know.&nbsp; I LOVE when shelter cats get homes - especially when the adopter is so concerned about proper care.&nbsp; If you email me at isabella_11372@yahoo.com, I&#039;ll give you my phone number.
