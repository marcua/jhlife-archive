					Many families with children in public schools are not aware of the<strong> 2006 Campaign for Fiscal Equity vs. State ruling</strong> that the State must pay out 5.6 Billion dollars to public schools for operational costs so when the IDC supports a budget that does not support this court ruling parents should be complaining and marching and finding a representative who will support a budget that funds a court mandated payout to their schools.<br /><br />From the brief - <br />&quot;More than a decade ago, we held that the Education Article of the New York State Constitution requires the state &quot;to offer all children the opportunity of a sound basic education&quot;(Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, 86 NY2d 307, 316 [1995] <br />[CFE I]).&nbsp; Plaintiffs had sought a declaratory judgment against the State, claiming that students in New York City public schools were not receiving a basic education and that the State&#039;s public school financing system is unconstitutional&quot;<br />

					This is not infighting - this is calling out representatives who are Democrat in Name Only. Please do not condescend by saying that I am being manipulated by anyone.&nbsp; If you want to have a political discussion then have one without that nonsense.<br /><br />&nbsp;If Peralta and the IDC are supporting a budget that gave the same amount of Foundation Aid as the GOP budget to public schools and only half of what the Democrats proposed then he is siding with the GOP.&nbsp; Yes, Cuomo gives nothing in his Executive Budget.&nbsp; Demanding that our democrats get in line and vote with their own party is not sapping progressive energy - it is creating a solid progressive agenda.&nbsp; If New York can&#039;t be a true blue state then we are lost.&nbsp; And if you are arguing that other branches of our State government are holding things up - please look at the list of legislature that the assembly has passed and is just languishing because it doesn&#039;t get introduced to the floor because the IDC and Felder have given the majority to Flanagan.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t we see the Sanctuary State go the floor?

					Let&#039;s get our facts straight on what happened in Albany yesterday. <br /><br />The Senate Democratic Committee was not even allowed to put a budget to the floor<br /><br />The GOP introduced their budget and then the IDC decided to introduce their own - WHY?&nbsp; <br />Hey I thought the GOP was going to work WITH Peralta and the IDC Dems - they are NOT.<br />The IDC saw that the GOP budget didn&#039;t include the DREAM ACT and so introduced their own budget that is 90% identical to the GOP budget except they added the DREAM ACT and the Millionaire Tax.&nbsp; <br /><br />Below is what the Democrats were voting against, which is 90% Trump-supporting GOP legislation:<br /><br />The IDC budget does not address Raise the Age in any way different from Republicans<br />•&nbsp; No adjustment to Foundation Aid or increase over Republican plan (that is your school funding)<br />•&nbsp; No changes to tuition affordability or higher education plan, and includes a rejection of the Excelsior Tuition plan<br />•&nbsp; No MWBE extension<br />•&nbsp; No Mayoral Control extension<br />•&nbsp; Accepts the Republican and Governor $65 million cut to MTA<br />•&nbsp; Supports Republican 421-A plan with only minor change to prevent unrelated changes to the Rent Act<br />•&nbsp; Accepts Republican proposal to establish a real property tax cap for NYC of 2%<br />•&nbsp; Accepts Republican proposal that reduces public water systems that must test for contaminants, eliminates testing for water systems serving less than 4,000 people<br />•&nbsp; Accepts Republican proposal to cut $120 million from parks capital projects<br />•&nbsp; Accepts Republican anti-environmental plans such as $108 million RGGI sweeps and extension of DERA compliance until 2020<br />•&nbsp; Accepts Republican proposal to give NYCHA only $100 million instead of $500 million (Assembly) or $1.5 billion over 5 years (SDC)<br />•&nbsp; Accepts elimination of $35 million for after-school programs<br />•&nbsp; Accepts Executive plan for increased premiums for Essential Plan working-class family enrollees<br />•&nbsp; Accepts Executive plan to cut $50 million in NYC Medicaid<br />•&nbsp; Accepts deferral of the Human Services COLA, keeping human service worker wages flat<br />•&nbsp; Supports proposal to increase lottery intercepts for public assistance recipients to 100% of winnings<br /><br /><br />THE IDC GIVES HUGE AMOUNTS OF SUPPORT TO THE GOP.&nbsp; <br />IDC SENATORS ARE NOT PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS.&nbsp; THEIR BUDGET IS NOT PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION. <br />ASK YOUR SENATORS TO STOP SHIFTING THE BLAME AND GET OUT OF THE IDC.&nbsp; <br /><br />WE NEED A DEMOCRAT MAJORITY LEADER.&nbsp; OUR DEMOCRATIC SENATORS CAN&#039;T BLAME ALL OF THIS MESS ON SIMCHA FELDER.<br /><br />
