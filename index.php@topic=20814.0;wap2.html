			Do you have any extra paint cans laying around and want to put them to use? Email me jeffsayyes@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />Sometime after this site is long gone, I am going to organize an event painting the grates in diversity plaza to make it look great again. (help me with some puns or naming). I&#039;m going to wait for a warm Sunday to do it though, so either January is out or it&#039;s short notice. <br /><br /><br />Just wanted to grab some eyes here before it&#039;s all over for JHL. <br /><br /><br />bon voyage Todd et al
