					Amid concerns about students’ reactions to the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why,” with its graphic depiction of teen suicide, the Department of Education sent a letter to principals this week with some guidance on how to help their communities process the show.<br /><br />The letter — from Jaye Murray, executive director of the Office of Counseling Support Programs, and Lois Herrera, CEO of the Office of Safety and Youth Development — provides links to support organizations like the National Association of School Psychologists and the Jed Foundation, a suicide-prevention program aimed at teens.<br />It also reminds schools that suicide-awareness training is available to all schools and provides a template for a letter that principals could send home to families, if they chose to do so.<br /><br />“It has come to our attention that there is a series on Netflix called ‘13 Reasons Why.’ It is based on a young adult novel that explores suicide, bullying, sexual assault, substance abuse, depression and anxiety in teens,” Murray and Herrera wrote. “It is important to be prepared for conversations that may occur among our students regarding this show, around depression, mental health and suicide.”<br /><br />The show has sparked concern among experts, who fear it could contribute to the “contagion” effect and how it portrays the way the character — who sends 13 cassette tapes to friends and acquaintances detailing their role in her decline — tries to get revenge.<br /><br />Leaders from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American School Counselor Association and the National Association of School Psychologists worried the show could contribute to such an effect and issued guidance on how discussions about the show could prevent it, according to Newsweek.<br /><br />“I believe unintentionally the producers really did kind of romanticize the suicide, and that is one of the reasons that contagion is a true concern here,” Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told Newsweek.<br /><br />Schools across the country are trying to open up dialogue about the popular show, and Netflix said it added explicit warnings to the three most graphic episodes as well as a warning before the first episode, the Washington Post reported.<br /><br />Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 2014, which is the most recent data available, showed that the number of deaths by suicide among children ages 10 to 14 for the first time was greater than the number of deaths by traffic accidents for that age group.<br /><br />DOE officials hope that principals will be able to engage students about the show.<br /><br />“We want students to know that we have resources available to support them,” the letter from Murray and Herrera stated. “We encourage students to reach out to adults and use the community resources available to them should they need someone to speak to about sexual abuse, drug use, depression, or if they are considering suicide.”<br /><br />(DNA)

					Foodtown Relaxed Lane tomorrow <br /><br />Hi Neighbors,<br /><br />Foodtown at 76-10 37th Avenue is going to be trying a &quot;Relaxed Checkout Lane&quot; from 7am-10am tomorrow morning Wednesday 2/22.<br /><br />I&#039;m an eldercare psychologist and I read about a relaxed checkout lane started at a supermarket in Australia during their senior citizen discount days. It allows people who need more time at the register to take it slow without the pressure of people behind them who are in a hurry. People in a rush can go to the other lanes.<br /><br />I thought it would be a good idea to try here in JH and Foodtown manager Mauricio Franco kindly agreed. I made signs for the register and gave a brief training session to some of their cashiers, who were very enthusiastic about the idea.<br /><br />Please try it out and let others know who might appreciate a less hectic supermarket checkout lane. If it&#039;s a good experience, tell the Foodtown workers so they will know it&#039;s worth continuing.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Eleanor Barbera<br /><br />PS -- Here&#039;s the link to the article and video about the program in Australia: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-38669395" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-38669395</a>

					<br /><strong>Plane Damages Runway While Landing at LaGuardia: Sources</strong><br /><br />A plane landing at LaGuardia Airport blew out a chunk of concrete on the runway as it was coming down, and flights are now backed up as crews try to repair the runway, airport sources say.<br />Runway 31 is closed as workers try to repair the hole, about 8 feet by 2 feet, sources say. That leaves just one runway open at the airport.<br /><br />Departing flights were delayed over an hour. Arriving flights were delayed about a half-hour.<br />Neal Buccino, a spokesman for Port Authority, which oversees the three New York City-area airports, said a pilot on a departing flight noticed the damage shortly after 3 p.m. and reported it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Plane-Blows-Out-Concrete-Runway-LaGuardia-Airport-Flights-Backed-Up-371589601.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Plane-Blows-Out-Concrete-Runway-LaGuardia-Airport-Flights-Backed-Up-371589601.html</a><br />

					This is why our efforts to maintain our historic district are so important.<br />We can never let our guard down and be ever vigilant.<br /><br /><strong>Elks Lodge Exterior Illegally Altered After Landmarking Push</strong><br /><br />Unique exterior details were illegally torn from the former Elks Lodge on 44th Drive this morning just days after the local community launched an effort to landmark the property and stave off development.<br /><br />Construction workers took jackhammers to the building, located at 21-42 44th Drive. An elk head, one of the building’s unique exterior details, has been hacked off.<br /><br />According to DOB documents, the work was taking place without proper permits. By Tuesday afternoon, police had arrived to enforce a stop work order from the Department of Buildings, an officer told the LIC Post.<br /><br />Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer, who wrote a letter to the Landmark Preservation Commission requesting landmark consideration of this property, called the illegal alteration “a disgraceful act of civic vandalism.”<br /><br />He reached out to the DOB and Mayor’s office to have inspectors visit the location and issue a stop work order.<br /><br />A construction supervisor told the LIC Post on Tuesday morning that the work being done was to test for asbestos, and not part of a demolition.<br /><br />Van Bramer and other community members were skeptical of that claim.<br /><br />The Councilman charged that developers started work in response to his landmark request letter as well as a community petition launched last week to prevent demolition of the building.<br /><br />“I think the letter terrified them,” Van Bramer said.<br /><br />“They are trying to destroy the façade of the building, which is the most architecturally significant part,” he continued. “The historical presence is extremely important in the landmarking process.”<br /><br />Richard Mazda, director of the nearby Secret Theatre who has been documenting work at the Elks Lodge on social media, agreed.<br /><br />“They are attacking the red brick sculptures of Elks on the front of the building,” he said. “They are destroying what makes it historically significant before it can be landmarked.”<br /><br />Orestes Gonzales of the Court Square Civic Association, which launched the Elks Lodge petition, said, “since they [developers] got word of the petition they have been working all weekend to destroy it before we could save it.”<br /><br />After purchasing the property late last year, Adam Westreich of Alwest Equities told the LIC Post that his company was working with Planet Partners to develop both 21-42 44th Drive and the lot next door as luxury condos.<br /><br />It is unclear where development plans stand now; the property was purchased once again in early February, according to City documents, although names listed on the buyer’s forms appear to have ties to Planet Partners.<br /><br />Neither company could be reached for comment as of press time.<br /><br />Van Bramer said that the developers should be punished for any illegal actions.<br /><br />“If they have violated laws, we want them to be subjected to the most severe penalties that exist,” he said. “In addition, they should have to restore any damage done to the building to preserve its historical value.”<br /><br />However, he added that once something is destroyed it is hard to restore it.<br /><br />“It may not be the same, but it is better than having the building demolished,” he said.<br /><br /><a href="http://licpost.com/2016/03/08/elks-lodge-exterior-illegally-altered-after-landmarking-push/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://licpost.com/2016/03/08/elks-lodge-exterior-illegally-altered-after-landmarking-push/</a><br /><br />

					From Assemblyman Den Dekker:<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Attempted Child Abduction</span></strong><br /><br />If you have ANY information please call the 115 Pct immediately 718-533-2003<br /><br />An incident occurred in the confines of the 115th Precinct this morning at approximately 0745 hours a 10 year old female was walking to Renaissance School (81 Street/37 Avenue) within the confines of the 115th Precinct, when a M/H perp in is 30&#039;s, 6&quot;2&quot; 200 pounds, wearing a green vest, black pants, black skull hat, and a blue packpack, called the girl from the other side of street and waved for her to come towards him. The girl was frightened and ran towards the School Crossing Guard on the corner. As the girl began to run towards the crossing guard, the perpetrator ran across the street and attempted to grab her. No contact was made, and there were no injuries. The 115th Precinct Squad is working on a wanted flyer right now, and I will get it out as soon as it is done.
