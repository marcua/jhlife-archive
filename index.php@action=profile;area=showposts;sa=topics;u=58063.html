					Hi Everyone,<br />&nbsp;<br />I ordered wallpaper for my nursery and am looking for a wallpaper installer/hanger for the job. It is a little complex because the pattern, but also because muslin will need to go on first, in order for the wallpaper to be removable for when we move on to the next place. It is very expensive wallpaper and I really need someone trustworthy.<br /><br />Any recommendations?

					Hello everyone,<br /><br />My father recently suffered a massive stroke which lead to cardiac arrest- for 6 minutes his brain did not receive oxygen.. Last week he was in a coma and on life support and couldn’t breathe without a ventilator, today he is breathing on his own and wakes up randomly, but is still not fully awake or responding to commands. We are waiting for one more test to tell us how bad it is but, we’d like to start researching rehab facilities since my dad will have to learn how to walk, talk, etc.. Have any of you had loved ones in Regal Heights rehab/nursing facility on 35th ave? Ideally, I’d like a facility that is close by and provides excellent care, where I can check on my dad through the day to make sure all is as it should be.<br /><br />If you’ve had any experience here - please let me know. <br /><br />If there is a rehab facility in queens or the city where you had a good experience, please let me know. <br /><br />I have friends at Cornell who have suggested their in patient rehab facility which I’m also looking into. <br /><br />Thank you so much in advance!! I appreciate any tidbit you can provide!

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />I have several vintage pieces I’d like to get tailored and fitted to me however, I have not had postitive experiences with a few places in the neighborhood and feel anxious just thinking about it. I would very much prefer a female going forward. I can go to Astoria, there are 2 ladies there, but I’d love to go do my fittings within walking distance. <br /><br />If you know of anyone- please share! <br />Thanks so much!

					Hi Everyone!<br /><br />I have a vintage, wool, chinese rug that I would like to get cleaned the old way- at a facility, cold water, ph shampoo etc.., Anyway, most of the places I have found in the area only do steam cleaning in house. I have called a few places in midtown but of course the price is exorbitant. I did find a a good place in Jersey- but obviously would rather stay in queens.<br /><br />If you know of any business that can clean a rug like this (also called one in astoria which was $600 vs. the $250 in Jersey), then please send the information my way! <br /><br />Thank you!!! <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" />

					Hello everyone! Happy Easter! I&#039;m sorry I always post here about horrible things. This morning cops and CSI were out on 74 between 35 and 37. The alley where the building that burned a few years ago was full of crime scene evidence markers. CSI was there bagging and tagging evidence. It was straight out of a movie. There seemed to be a secondary scene down on 35th between 74 and 75. Heard in the building someone was murdered. Usually I feel safe in the 70s since it&#039;s not as rowdy as let&#039;s say 85-90th streets. Anyway, does anyone know what happend?

					Last night at 4 AM, on 74th street between 35 and 37 AV, I was woken by the screams of a woman yelling help me! Help me! She was screaming and crying and I also heard a mans voice screaming. I thought maybe he may have been sexually assaulting her so I ran out of bed to call 911 and went to the window to see what was going on. They were both still screaming walking in the middle of the street but as I watched I noticed he wasn&#039;t assaulting her, they were in fact together and both hysterical about something they saw. The man was saying omg, omg, and bent over clearly in distress. The cops came a second later and stopped to speak to them. I couldn&#039;t hear what they were saying I caught something about the alley, behind that building that burned down. You know, where Armandos used to be. After that like 10 squad cars came and there were cops all over. Some of there were using flashlights and looking in the grass in front of the building by the alley. I have no idea what they found or what happened but the couple went with them and after some time they all left. Anybody know what happened? It freaked me out so bad. I know somebody called 911 before me since I hadn&#039;t even finished dialing when the cops came.
