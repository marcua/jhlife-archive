No word yet on when and what, but I like the idea. Anyone know more?

				This is the first I&#039;ve heard of it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great idea.&nbsp; I would sign up in a second.

				A while back we had a thread for the Community Journal that was started by Bryan.&nbsp; He mentions <em><strong>GO JH!</strong></em> as one of the services offered by the Journal.&nbsp; Not sure if the rules have changed over time.<br /><br />Community Journal - Jackson Heights (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=217.0)

				I wish them luck, but am somewhat cynical about how effective the program will be. Are you more likely to shop at Duane Reade because you have their loyalty card? No, because you probably have a dozen other loyalty cards dangling from your key chain.<br /><br />I hope it is successful, though. Hopefully it will lead to more initiatives to support local businesses. A Jackson Heightsâ€”or Queensâ€”currency, perhaps? I wouldn&#039;t mind paying for my milk in Jacksons.

				Actually I am more likely to shop at a place where I have an affinity card. For the supermarkets and drugstores, I read their flyers more closely than the others, and mostly go to them for my big shopping.<br /><br />I have one of the early models of the GO JH! cards and definitely patronized the establishments that honored them. I like flashing my ID and saving some money. Makes me feel cool!<br /><br />Even cooler than I already am, and that&#039;s saying something! :D
