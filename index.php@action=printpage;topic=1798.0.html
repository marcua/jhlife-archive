				folks,<br /><br />what do you think about buying a co-op/condo in jackson heights now?&nbsp; of course, everyone says that prices are going to come down bigtime in &#039;09, but i&#039;m ready to buy now.&nbsp; how much can prices really come down in jackson heights?<br /><br />also, what have you guys heard about stratford hall, the rental-to-condo conversion bldg on 35th av &amp; 80th st?&nbsp; is the building secure financially?&nbsp; wonder if would it be wise to buy a condo there....<br /><br />many thanks in advance for your feedback,&nbsp; :)<br />aj

				This is just personal opinion from living here for two decades.&nbsp; It&#039;s not based on anything but personal experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s a good time to buy IF you find something you love.&nbsp; Prices here are always lower than Manhattan and Brooklyn no matter what the economy is doing.&nbsp; And they don&#039;t go up in value like those boroughs either.&nbsp; On the plus side, you get more apartment for the money.<br /><br />As to a newly converted rental:&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; Most Sponsor owned buildings have so many problems until the buildings are Shareholder run, I just wouldn&#039;t buy there.&nbsp; But that&#039;s me and that&#039;s based on my experience of buying a Sponsor run building back when I bought my 2 bedroom.&nbsp; The financial statements were doctored to look better than they really were and it was years before the building was actually a great investment.&nbsp; I&#039;d look at the other buildings that have been converted for awhile longer and see if there&#039;s something I like.

				If you&#039;re looking to stay here long-term, then it&#039;s not that relevant to try to time the market.&nbsp; Real estate always go up over time.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have a down payment ready and the interest rates look good, then you should go for it!&nbsp; In a soft market, prices are more negotiable too, so even if you believe prices aren&#039;t rock-bottom now (and no one can really predict these things, can they?), you still have a current advantage as a buyer.&nbsp; For comparison&#039;s sake, I bought when it was a seller&#039;s market and there was a bidding war.&nbsp; Trust me, you don&#039;t ever want that heartache! <br />I live in a co-op so unfortunately I have no advice for you about condos here. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t buy now if you don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; I agree it will come down substantially in 2009.&nbsp; They&#039;re predicting 165,000+ job losses in NYC.&nbsp; In the building that I live in we have 4 units that have been on the market for months with NO interest.&nbsp; I agree with Buddy that you should avoid Strattford Hall Conversion.&nbsp; The building will be mostly investors who can rent to any one they want without Board approval.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested in a Condo consider Colton on 35th Ave but again wait since prices are high.&nbsp; With prices dropping, maintenance increasing plus job losess in NYC expect to see Foreclosures for Cooperatives in JH&#039;s for those who purchased in the last two years at the HIGH.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have lots to choose from late next year.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Quite frankly, most co-ops function like businesses.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think all of them will suffer if they have managed their building, financial situation and shareholders for their benefit.&nbsp; Many of these co-ops are strict and really examine the people before their possible passage to co-op residency: They do this to assure a situation like an economic recession.&nbsp; I think most cooperatives in Jackson Heights are safe for the most part - or at least won&#039;t suffer tremendously.&nbsp; Now Stratford Hall is a remarkable building!&nbsp; So enticing with that tacky, plastic decor that car salesmen use to desperately attract buyers! Hmm.... I think I&#039;d totally pass on that building, especially on the topic of buying.&nbsp; I have a friend whom I grew up with who has been in that building for years.&nbsp; It&#039;s an utter s**thole even as a rental building.&nbsp;

				I am by no means a real estate expert, but I really think that JH continues to be a very desirable neighborhood, and I don&#039;t think that we are going to see the drops in prices that other communities throughout the country are seeing.&nbsp; While I have mixed feelings about the fact that JH has been &quot;discovered,&quot; I think that there is no going back and it will continue to be a &quot;hot&quot; neighborhood.&nbsp; Unless you have a really great rent-controlled apartment, I would say that the neighborhood is still a really good investment.&nbsp; Even though gas prices have gone down, there is still a lot of insecurity about the future, and a walkable neighborhood with excellent transportation in which a car is not needed is a big plus in uncertain times.&nbsp; The gorgeous apartments, (which are selling for 4 times what they went for 10-12 years ago), are still considered a bargain by folks coming from Manhattan or Brooklyn.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t think the values are going to continue to increase at that rate, I also don&#039;t think they are going to go down much if at all.&nbsp; And as others have said, if you plan on settling in for more than a couple of years, I think it continues to be a good investment.&nbsp;
