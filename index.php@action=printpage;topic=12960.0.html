				I am all for the Mom and Pop shops, personal service, etc, but there are a few things that are unfortunately pushing me to give more of my business to the chains vs the small pharmacies—even though I am philosophically opposed to the takeover of chain drug stores. <br /><br />One, the convenience of longer hours. I had some items I needed a few Sundays ago, and only a small amount of time in which to get them. I went by Frank&#039;s Pharmacy, but they were just locking up at 3 PM. So I went to Duane Reade. <br /><br />Second, the quality of goods. I went to Frank&#039;s Pharmacy in December to buy all my gift wrap and gift tags. The only gift wrap they carried was so extremely substandard, thin, and cheap cheap cheap, it disintegrated in your hands when you tried to wrap it around a box. I literally could not do anything with it -- it kept tearing. So when I needed gift wrap for Valentine&#039;s Day, I again went to Duane Reade. <br /><br />We had been loyal Maram customers and went nowhere else while they were still around. But now--I&#039;m pretty much going to Duane Reade. And that&#039;s how it happens. <br /><br />I wish that Frank&#039;s—for one example because I am not really familiar with the others—would step up the quality of some of their merchandise. I know people love the place. I had not used them before, and I have to say I have been disappointed in this regard. As for the service at the pharmacy itself, I have found Duane Reade and Frank&#039;s to be equally responsive and nice and personalized and helpful.

				I use Frank&#039;s for all my prescriptions. They are wonderful about filling the medications, applying insurance and delivering them that day. When they need to order prior to delivering, the meds are received the next day. They are also great with OTC medical needs. <br /><br />They are friendly and most helpful. I enjoy the comfort in knowing that they will take care of our medicine needs - which is unfortunately is too many and varied. As far as closing @ 3pm, I can only think of the night that the &quot;blizzard to end all blizzards&quot; was forecast. I know they had to hold my medication delivery until the next day - with my permission. Other than that, they are open beyond 6pm and later.<br /><br />As far as gift paper and other sundry items, I general do not buy them in a drug store. Perhaps that would be a suggestion for you. I have never been please getting my medications at a chain store.

				Franks and Maram were both fantastic in terms of prescription service.&nbsp; When Franks burned, I switched to Rite Aid and I have repeatedly had problems with their communication about prescriptions.&nbsp; Twice I have been promised on the automatic refill line that my prescription will be there after a certain time the next day, and I have gone there, stood in line and found out that they actually didn&#039;t even have the drug I needed and I would have to come back again.&nbsp; This kind of snafu never happened at the smaller pharmacies.<br /><br />In terms of gift and other items, I actually quite liked the products that Franks stocked.&nbsp; I bought small gift items there a few times, and I know two people who would do a huge amount of stocking up for small Christmas items there.&nbsp; I never tried the wrapping paper, though.&nbsp; I have only been back to the new location once, so I&#039;m not sure how their current selection is.
