				I&#039;ve been seeing NYC&#039;s ZeroWaste flyers recently at the greenmarket. I see these most popularly among small residential homes, but am wondering if any larger apartment buildings in the neighborhood have enrolled. I think it would be exciting for obvious reasons, but also understand that this is a concerted effort, and it would also be prudent for the super to buy in. Thoughts?<br /><br />Some additional info while peddling around: http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/food-scraps-and-yard-waste.shtml<br /><br />Impressions in Brooklyn: https://www.ediblebrooklyn.com/2017/what-to-do-if-your-building-doesnt-have-a-brown-composting-container-from-the-department-of-sanitation/

				&nbsp;If people in apt buildings truly take the time to understand how this will be done, they would most likely sign up. Not only<br />does it make an asset (compost for NYC )out of a liability (wet food garbage with methane emissions) but it makes your<br />total garbage collection much smaller and cleaner. You use less bags as dry garbage doesn&#039;t need changing as much. It&#039;s all<br />great once you implement the system. Noting that buildings in the Gramercy Park area are using them now which is great<br />to see.<br />&nbsp;Plus NYC has been able to sell some of its compost in Staten Island which is where we used to dump everything till it got <br />out of control. A check back to NYC for food garbage turned compost!
