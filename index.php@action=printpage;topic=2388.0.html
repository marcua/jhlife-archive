				March&#039;s Food Group will be at Mi Estrella (formerly Grande Estrella) <br />88-19 Roosevelt Ave.<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br /><br />Should be very interesting... another stimulating atmosphere for the group. <br /><br />The more people we get, the better sampling of food we can see. The space is pretty large, seems set up for families and large groups. The people working there seem serious about there business. I like that. Check out the other thread dealing with the topic&nbsp; as linked below. <br /><br />This was fusion before marketers created the word. Read about it below<br /><br />Let me know if you are interested!<br /><br />Most likely March 22nd at 6.15pm ... unless this doesn&#039;t work out for people who are interested. So let me know!<br /><br />Links:<br />About Chino-Latino http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/4/5/1/p114518_index.html (http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/4/5/1/p114518_index.html)<br />Blog Review from C Tann http://ctannstarr.activerain.com/post/856937/mi-estrella (http://ctannstarr.activerain.com/post/856937/mi-estrella)<br />JHLife Thread on the subject http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1453.0 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1453.0)<br /><br /><br />

				oh yeah, their takeout menu is totally nonchalant. First, there&#039;s no prices. Second, it has the name of the prior business. For some reason it&#039;s Mi Estrella now, not Grande Estrella. Taxes? <br />I think this will probably be a spin on what I&#039;m used to.

				Is this open to anyone? I am new to JH and see lots of interesting places to eat, but sadly have no friends in the neighborhood. I would love to find out which restaurants are the best and try them out<br /><br />I went to Sripithai in woodside a few eeks ago with a freind and we were perplexed by the hours-long liones formed outside a fast food place with a big chicken mascot on the corner of rooselvelt and 64th. Does anyone know what that is?

				Karen, the monthly food group is open to anyone.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a quote from Jeffsayyes, the JHL member that&#039;s been organizing the monthly group meetings:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2388.msg16215#msg16215">Quote from: Jeffsayyes on March 06, 2009, 07:56:19 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The more people we get, the better sampling of food we can see.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The long line you and your friend witnessed was probably for Jolibee, a new fast food Filipino restaurant.&nbsp; It opened recently, so that may explain the line.&nbsp; Here&#039;s some more info on it:<br /><br />Jolibee on Roosevelt Ave (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2322.msg15825#msg15825)

				Karen - This is exactly why the group exists! <br />It&#039;s an issue going around in Jackson Heights it seems like... lots of great places to eat, but I think places to freshly meet people are limited. soooooo.... Come and meet some JHers!

				Looking good - We have more than a few new people coming this week. Somehow people are finding me through my site. All Jackson heights people.<br />There is definitely a need in this neighborhood for making friends. Hopefully this is helping. <br /><br />We will probably need to get a whole table at Mi Estrella - so more people the better, we won&#039;t run out of space. Plus, it should be a nice day, so hopefully no one will mind taking a short walk. Hope to see anyone who is interested there!

				Yummy would not be how I would describe it, but the experience was worth it since we got to meet new folks!&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind bonding over bad food...occasionally.&nbsp; :laugh:&nbsp; If you want to know more, check out the two Yelp reviews on it- mine and Jeff&#039;s (so far)- search for it under its old name&nbsp;La Grande Estrella.

				I forgot I hadnâ€™t posted a link to the photographs. My pictures of the March dinner at Mi Estrella can be viewed in this album (http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=96872&amp;id=510279107&amp;l=5def54efe2) beginning with image number twelve. Anyone with a Facebook account should feel free to tag herself in the pictures.
