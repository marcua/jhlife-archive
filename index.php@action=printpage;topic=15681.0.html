				&nbsp;Here is a post from Nuala copied from JH Families. Its so important to support our community and this group covers so much territory in the neighborhood with very little funding. Let&#039;s change that by becoming a member today- $25, and send a bit more if you can afford it. If the links don&#039;t connect go to www.jhbg.org and click on &quot;membership&quot;.<br /><br /><strong>To the Jackson Heights Community,<br /></strong><br />I want to ask each of you to join the Jackson Heights Beautification Group (JHBG).

JHBG is made up of volunteers. It’s a 501(C)3 nonprofit organization, and your contribution is tax-deductible.<br />For questions or concerns, contact us.

				&nbsp;Hello. Giving Tuesday is once again upon us. This year the Jackson Heights Beautification Group is registered officially<br />with this group and if your company does matching gifts, for example, you can use this official international site to donate and maximize the amount. The other option is donating directly to the group on their website ( www.jhbg.org) which is easy to do<br />with paypal or credit cards. Sending donations in mail is great too. Whatever works for you. December events coming up are <br />the tree lighting and caroling event on Dec.9th at the JH Post Office, the JH Orchestra holiday concert on Dec. 13th at St. Marks Church and a volunteer dinner with details on the site later in the month.<br />&nbsp;And one more -&nbsp; the Santa bike ride from Travers Park where JHBG helped with funding - also on Dec. 9th. So help them make <br />your neighborhood of Jackson Heights, the best place to live.&nbsp;
