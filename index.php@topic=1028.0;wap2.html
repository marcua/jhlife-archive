			<br />--- Quote from: buddy on May 11, 2008, 04:16:06 PM ---Question: when should you start using flea prevention stuff?&nbsp; My vet said as soon as it&#039;s warm but when do you do yours?&nbsp; And any suggestions as to which one to use?<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br />I hold off as long as I can. Most of the products available are very high in their side-effect profile. Both my dogs have had reactions to a couple of them. If you don&#039;t expect to expose your dog to the environments where fleas and ticks breed, I personally wouldn&#039;t use any protection at all. Even when using the damned stuff, the paws don&#039;t seem to be protected at all. So, each time I come home from an unsafe place I check all 8 paws for ticksâ€”nasty little buggers. I have small dogs, so when I do decide to use something I use Advantix K9 Flea Killer Plus because it comes in an &#039;under 10 pound&#039; formula. Discuss it with your vet. Ask questions. Read up about the use of the products online. Make an informed decision. <br /><br />Heartworm medication, on the other hand, is a must!<br /><br />Most vets charge a lot of money for these products. You have 3 choices: 1) Print out the cheapest price you can find for the item online and bring it with you to the vet visit and ask the vet to match the price; 2) ask for a prescription for the product so that you can go online and order it less expensively; 3) pay the vet whatever he wants for the stuff!<br /><br />I do #1. He laughs at me, but he matches the price every year!

			I just came across this sad story from Gothamist about a dog that was recently electrocuted by stray voltage emanating from a street lamppost in Long Island City.&nbsp; The more I read these types of stories, the more nervous I become when my dog wants to sniff around the neighborhood lampposts or walk over the large metal street plates that are commonly found near construction sites.&nbsp; I imagine that our dogs aren&#039;t the only ones that can be susceptible to this type of danger.<br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2008/05/27/dog_shocked_to.php

			I ended up getting the Frontline Plus. After reading and comparing online, most people said Frontline was stronger and longer lasting.&nbsp; Since I bathe Casey every week or so, I decided to get the stronger one.&nbsp; And I&#039;m happy that he hasn&#039;t had any reaction to it so I&#039;ll probably stick with it.&nbsp; It is expensive though.&nbsp; Over $50 for three months supply.&nbsp; And it is cheaper online but I&#039;m not sure I trust those places to have the real deal and not some bootleg crap.

			I used Revolution last year, and am trying to delay the application as long as I can.&nbsp; With the warmer weather upon us now, I&#039;m just going to have to do it.&nbsp; The vet told us that Revolution will help prevent fleas, ticks and heartworm all in one monthly dose.

			Most people know enough not to lock a pet in a car but be careful not to tie them up in the sun all day either.&nbsp; Some pets with short hair can get burned and the blacktop is incredibly hot for them.&nbsp; When my Cocker Spaniel Patches was still alive she used to pull me to get on the grass.&nbsp; If you ever had a dog that has short legs and its belly is close to the ground you can&#039;t believe the heat that radiates off the blacktop.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t believe it&nbsp; try walking bare foot on blacktop that is in the sun.
