				<strong><br />&quot;Teaching Your Child to Ride a Bike&quot; Workshop<br />Sunday, July 13th 10am-1pm<br />78th St between 34th Avenue &amp; Northern Blvd<br /></strong><br />Bike New York will host a &quot;Teaching Your Child to Ride a Bike&quot; Workshop in Jackson Heights on July 13th. This event will mark the official opening of the 78th Street Play Street which is an initiative to create a car-free recreation area for children on 78th Street between Northern Blvd and 34th Avenue on Sundays from July 13th through November 16th. This initiative was the result of the hard work of community partners JHGreen, Friends of Travers Park/JHBG, and the Western Jackson Heights Alliance. <br /><br />The workshop teaches a safe, easy, effective way for parents to help get their children rolling--a method in which the child does most of the work! Participants learn the basics of balancing, starting, stopping, and steering a bike. Children may learn to ride their bike while taking the class, but even if they don&#039;t, parents will leave with an easy, hands-free, crash-free, and low-stress way to teach their child to ride. <br /><br />All cyclists must wear a helmet and have a bicycle that fits. The child must be able to rest his or her feet flat on the ground while sitting on the bicycle seat. The program works best for children ages 5 and up. <br /><strong><br />Participation is free, but pre-registration is required.</strong> Please register at: http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child_application.php4 (http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child_application.php4)<br />
