					Hi. I live in Jackson Heights but am moving soon, and my sofa and matching chairs are too big for my new place. I tried selling them on Craigslist with no luck, and I&#039;ve had no success trying to donate them either. (Housing Works wouldn&#039;t take them, Goodwill NY/NJ no longer takes furniture, and the SA can&#039;t pick them up before I move.)<br /><br />I&#039;m attaching photos. The sofa is 78 inches long, and the chairs are 40 inches wide. They&#039;re in very good shape, except for some subtle fading, and a wrinkle across the seat of one of the chairs. If you&#039;re interested, please pm me and let me know ASAP—I need to get rid of them by this weekend (and I&#039;d hate to put them out with the &quot;big garbage&quot;).

					Why does so much garbage pile up in this one location? It&#039;s in front of a store that recently closed, which often tended to have a lot of trash on the sidewalk outside. But now that the store is closed, I think the trash had nothing to do with that store. Any clues about how so much piles up?<br /><br />There tend to be a lot of paper coffee cups that look alike, but I don&#039;t know where they&#039;re from. <br /><br />

					Recently I saw an unleashed dog—small, white, fluffy, older—standing outside a corner store at 73rd and 37th. I watched it for a minute as I waited to cross the street. When I knelt and talked to it, it was friendly but looked a little forlorn. I opened the door to the store and asked if the owner was in there. He came out, and I said he should have tied up his dog—that it could have run off or been snatched by someone. He was (to say the least) not very receptive: He called me a b--tch and told me to shut up. <br /><br />I followed him and his still-unleashed dog a couple of blocks. The dog was well behaved—did not run into the street or anything. I didn&#039;t feel like the dog was in imminent danger when it was walking with the man, though it got pretty far ahead of him at times. That seemed risky. I&#039;ve heard stories about dogs being snatched and used for training fighting dogs, like pit bulls. <br /><br />In the end, I felt like maybe I was being a stick-in-the mud who should have kept her mouth shut. I tried to make it clear I was worried about the dog&#039;s safety, not about him following some arbitrary rule. I really was mostly concerned when the dog was outside the shop alone.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/embarrassed.gif" alt="&#58;-&#091;" title="Embarrassed" class="smiley" />&nbsp; <br /><br />So why am I posting about it now? I guess maybe I want someone to tell me I was right. Or to say, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s just Nick and Buster, no need to worry!&quot;

					I often wonder about stuff I see and hear in the neighborhood. I&#039;ve finally decided to post about one of them.<br /><br />About a half hour ago I was in my bedroom and heard, on the far side of the room, a chirpy ringing sound, almost like a telephone. It was kind of loud. It rang three or four times. The only suspects near the source of the sound are my computer and my Spectrum cable modem. My computer was asleep, so I woke it up and looked around to see if it could possibly have been something there. Couldn&#039;t find anything. So I think it may have been the cable modem.<br /><br />It hasn&#039;t recurred but I am still wondering what the hell it was. And I figure posting here to ask if anyone else had a ringing sound from their modem would be a lot easier than trying to find someone at Spectrum who might know anything!<br /><br />P.S. I realize I must sound pretty crazy posting this.&nbsp; <br />

					I live in Washington Plaza (35th Ave between 73 and 74) and lately, when I&#039;m home, my iPhone is worthless in terms of making phone calls, both on cellular and WiFi. I can use the phone fine for other things, like texting and the net. Just not the phone. It constantly breaks up and the calls fail.<br /><br />I occasionally have problems in other locations but it seems really bad in my apartment. I wonder if anyone else around here is having a similar problem. I&#039;m not sure when it started because I don&#039;t use the phone much. I&#039;d say at least two months.<br /><br />&nbsp;

					To most people across the country, this is a story about Jared Kushner&#039;s company doing something sneaky and illegal. But to renters here in Queens, it&#039;s just another example of what landlords and management companies get away with all over the city, despite the supposedly tougher stance by the de Blasio administration against these tactics. Of course, tenants need to know their rights in the first place to challenge what goes on, and many of them don&#039;t. I&#039;m glad to see that some of them fought back, even though they had to get lawyers to do it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/03/18/us/ap-us-kushner-cos-false-documents.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/03/18/us/ap-us-kushner-cos-false-documents.html</a>

					Okay, I know this is a <em>very</em> long shot, but a couple of years ago I talked to a woman at a small ceremony at the Wink the Penguin statue. She had the best glasses! I complimented her on them and she let me take a picture of them. I&#039;ve tried to find those same frames with no luck. Now that two years have passed, I&#039;m thinking, well, just <em>maybe</em> she&#039;s tired of them and is ready for a change!

					I recently read in another thread here about rats at the small U-shaped grouping of attached houses at 35-50 73rd Street. Tonight, walking up 73rd on the opposite side of the street, I saw two large rats running back and forth across the sidewalk in front of the apartment building at 35-55. This was further up the block, but not quite as far as the building&#039;s service entrance.<br /><br />I usually walk up 73rd on my way home from the subway, because it&#039;s a little better lit than 74th. This is the first time I ever saw rats, though I did see a decapitated rooster in front of 35-55 once.
