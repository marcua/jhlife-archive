					I admit I don&#039;t eat pizza too often even though I love it. I went to Pizza Boy yesterday for the first time in a couple of months and it was so much better than usual. I didn&#039;t recognize the guy who was making the pizza, so I guess they have a new pizza chef. The crust actually had some flavor instead of tasting like a matzoh cracker, the sauce was good and it was just all-around really good. I ordered two regular slices; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had a baby pizza. <br /><br />Has anyone else noticed this or did I just get lucky? <br /><br />&nbsp;

					The untimely death of Eddie Van Halen must have really done a job on one of my neighbors. He has been playing the electric guitar really loudly since the day he died and it goes on for hours. I assume amplifiers have volume control but I guess his only goes to 11. <br /><br />Anyway, dude, if you are reading this, please take pity on your neighbors and give it a rest or at least shut your windows. You are not talented enough for the daily concert you subject us to.<br /><br />RIP Eddie

					Has anyone ever gone to Courage Fitness in Woodside?&nbsp; Looking for opinions. <br /><br />My office just gave us an incredible gym pass perk so I&#039;m looking for some gyms in the area - I don&#039;t care about classes but I do care about weights. <br /><br />I can go to any NYSC for just $10 a month but I&#039;m kind of grossed about by reviews of the locations in Queens. Lots of complaints about cleanliness and it doesn&#039;t sound like any of them have enough weightlifting equipment. <br /><br />I have a lot more options if I spend $40 a month and Courage Fitness is one of the participating gyms in Queens. It looks kind of neat - I plan to check it out but am interested to hear if anyone else has been there. <br /><br />If I&#039;m wrong about NYSC, please let me know! If one of the area locations is clean I&#039;d definitely visit.

					My building is undergoing a coop conversion and the prices they want are ridiculous. They are attempting to get historic district prices (even higher than that, actually) for a non-historic district building with no garden or parking.&nbsp; We were first given notice about this close to two years ago - including the &quot;insider&quot; price for our apartments. Now that they are getting closer to the actual conversion, we received updated prices for our apartments. Mine increased by $130,000. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Moderator note: This is a new thread created from splitting some posts from another thread. </em>

					Hi all, <br /><br />Stew is ruining my life by not being open yet! I have three elderly women visiting this weekend and I am looking for someplace to take them for lunch on Sunday that isn&#039;t Indian or Thai (two of them are very unadventurous eaters even though I think they would like Arunee).&nbsp; I live on 73rd/35th so under 80th street is a necessity since we will be walking and I don&#039;t want to make them trek too far.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken them to Armondo&#039;s before the fire and Novo before it closed. <br /><br />So, any advice?&nbsp; Uncle Peter&#039;s is a bit too far and I have to admit I haven&#039;t been all that impressed the times I&#039;ve been there. El Rinco Tinto is good but I&#039;m hoping for something with more of a sit-down restaurant feel. I really liked the Argentinian place that was next to Armondo&#039;s - isn&#039;t there something a bit similar up 37th a bit?&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the name.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish they would be here on Saturday so I could take them to see Despaña (they are all from Spain and would love it).&nbsp; I am going to try to talk them into Arunee but don&#039;t know if I will have any luck.&nbsp; My poor mom will be with us and I feel bad because she loves Thai but is stuck with the old ladies who always want seafood - oh, a seafood place would be good (not sushi) - I hate fish but I&#039;ll suffer through it if there&#039;s a good one nearby. <br /><br />thanks

					I know there are a couple of other people who post here and live in Washington Plaza (73rd/35th) - we got a red herring preliminary prospectus plan left outside our doors last night.&nbsp; <br /><br />At first I panicked because I got pushed out of my beloved Financial District apartment a few years ago when it went condo (I couldn&#039;t afford the $1.3 million purchase price for 650 square feet!).&nbsp; But the more I read, it seems like it&#039;s a non-eviction plan - meaning non-purchasing tenants won&#039;t be evicted.&nbsp; It still scares me a bit because they can easily find petty reasons not to renew a lease if they really want us out. <br /><br />Anyway, my main reason for writing here is to see if any other tenants looked at what they plan to charge. It seems really high to me considering there&#039;s no parking or private garden and not in the historic district.&nbsp; They plan to charge $270K for my one-bedrooom, and that is the preferential price for existing tenants. Maintenance would be $780. Nearby coops in that price range either have a much lower maintenance or a garage (or a private garden).&nbsp; <br /><br />Any opionions on that price?&nbsp; It&#039;s a good size apartment but has a lot of street noise (faces 73rd).&nbsp; Is it possible to negotiate price like if I were just buying a regular coop instead of a conversion?&nbsp;

					Can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised!&nbsp; I know many of you like it but I found it filthy and got sick every single time I ate there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how long they&#039;ll be closed but they have paper up covering the windows.&nbsp; I made the mistake of stopping into the new grocery attached to them and the eagle theater.&nbsp; Oh my god, it is disgusting in there!&nbsp; I didn&#039;t touch a thing and ran out in horror.&nbsp; Why would anyone shop there when there are 10 other options on the same block is beyond me.

					Anyone remember when they were filming a movie in one of the restuarants on 37th - I think it&#039;s where either Himilayan Hut or Mustang Thalaki currently resides.&nbsp; It was probably about 4 years ago.&nbsp; Anyway - my mom just watched something on Netflix that has to be whatever was filming there - she recognized 37th Street and the exterior shots.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s called Today&#039;s Special and is available for free streaming on Netflix if you have an account.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t watched it yet but mom said it was a lighthearted farce about a guy taking over the family restaurant.&nbsp;

					In case any of you haven&#039;t seen it on the news, we have another groper in the hood and he seems to be getting bolder.&nbsp; There have been 4 incidents over the last couple of weeks - at random times (not late at night - one was at 5pm) and the women range in age from 18-47.&nbsp; He runs away, but they think he might have struck in Sunnyside Gardens over the weekend and he actually pushed this woman to the ground and kept assaulting her but a neighbor ran outside and stopped the guy.&nbsp; The description was very similar to the JH guy.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure most of you have heard this by now, but just in case...

					Does anyone know if garbage trucks are limited to certain hours?&nbsp; Over the last two weeks, they&#039;ve picked up on my block at 2 in the morning three times, including last night.&nbsp; It is so loud (compactors) and they were outside my window for almost 45 minutes (they picked up for 3 buildings and moved on). Then another truck came at 6am for the big stuff like couches (I know that is reasonable).&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; <br /><br />I heard both my upstairs and downstairs neighbors wake up from the noise (I could hear them moving around) and saw people across the street looking out their windows, so I know it was an annoyance for a lot of people.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

					I usually put NY1 on when I get ready for work.&nbsp; This morning they had a story about a number of women being groped recently in Jackson Heights - they didn&#039;t say exactly where but I think it was mainly around Roosevelt Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just wanted to make everyone aware...
