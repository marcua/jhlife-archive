				It appears that Mandees has officially closed its doors at the Northern Blvd. location.&nbsp; Does anyone know what&#039;s in store for that parcel of real estate?&nbsp; I tried searching the DOB website, but couldn&#039;t find any permits pertaining to the address.&nbsp; By the way, someone had mentioned to me a while back that some sort of housing development was to be built at the site, but I haven&#039;t been able to verify that info.

				Is it big enough for a gym?&nbsp; Man, we could really use a gym around here.&nbsp; My kickboxing classes are just super crowded, as it&#039;s pretty much the only option for most people.&nbsp; I imagine a real gym would get a ton of business.&nbsp; Gotta work off all that delicious Indian and Latin food somehow!&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				That site would be awesome for a gym as it also emcompasses the area of its parking lot.&nbsp; That said, I wonder if the Garden School will have any involvement with the available space.&nbsp; Also, wouldn&#039;t that space play a nice role in a possible expansion of Travers Park?&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s been mentioned on the forum before.

				I&#039;m all for it if it includes more green and less concrete.&nbsp; Would be nice to have somewhere to go sit outside in the grass and read a book in the summer.&nbsp; Travers Park is more of a concrete playground/sports park - something more along the lines of Washington Square Park or Madison Square Park could really spruce this area up.

				I&#039;m not sure how it could help with the expansion of Travers. It is on the eastern side. If BlockBuster went out of business then<br />that would adjoin 78th St but that part of the street is still going to be occupied with the necessary access to Garden School&#039;s garages.

				I too think it would be a good space for a gym such as a Planet Fitness. I did go to Daniel Dromm&#039;s office the other day and spoke with Mr. Ronan regarding attracting businesses to this area and specifically about the Mandee&#039;s space since his office would know more about the size and restrictions of the store.&nbsp; Does anyone think it would help to send a petition/letter to Planet Fitness(or other businesses we wish to attract)<br />expressing our interest?&nbsp; I did send a copy of the Planet Fitness webpage where it says suggest a location to Daniel Dromm&#039;s office.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know whether they will follow up.

				I think it will help to send the location request form to any business we&#039;d like in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The people at the Forest Hills&#039; Trader Joe&#039;s have told me to tell my friends and neighbors to fill out their Location Request Form on their website.&nbsp; They know how crowded that location has become and said it can&#039;t hurt to fill out the form.&nbsp; http://www.traderjoes.com/about/location-requests-form.asp<br />I&#039;ll also gladly go to the Planet Fitness Request Form.

				A quick search on the New York City Department of Buildings website reveals that permits have been issued for work at the former Mandees location.&nbsp; Note that the old Blockbuster shared the same 78-02 Northern Blvd. address, so the permits may also apply to that location.<br /><br />If my search is correct, it appears that a Toyota dealership may be in the works.&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; That may explain why there are cars currently parked in the Mandees lot.&nbsp; According to one of the permits recently issued, the corresponding e-mail address and phone number are that for Queensboro Toyota with a current address in Woodside.&nbsp; Hoping I&#039;m wrong on this.<br /><br />New York City Department of Buildings (http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/JobsQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=5&amp;passjobnumber=440080822&amp;passdocnumber=01)

				Uh, remind me - isn&#039;t there a Toyota dealership on Northern and 78th?<br /><br />Maybe they will move there and free up the end of 78-77th &amp; Northern for the park.<br /><br />When pigs fly, most likely. . . :(

				I believe the closest one is 62nd &amp; Northern. I didn&#039;t know that before, but when I read this I thought it would a shock if there wasn&#039;t one already down the road in Woodside on dealership alley. Maybe all the illegally parked cars belong to these guys and they are going legit?&nbsp; ;D

The current owner is 78-02 Northern Boulevard LLC with a mailing address of 77-12 Northern Blvd, which is the auto dealership adjacent to Travers Park. A quick web search for the name of the person the property was transfering from pulled up a connection to a dealership in Woodside. I think all of these properties are owned by the same person or group.<br /><br />http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=FT_4750006281075 (http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=FT_4750006281075)
