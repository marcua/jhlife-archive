We like the garden co ops. Iv been looking for a good couple of months now and i feel like nothing at all is coming up.&nbsp; We can&#039;t buy an spt on high floors of a walk up although&nbsp; first or second floor is ok and we would love a garden! !! Is it just me or are the garden co ops very difficult to come by.&nbsp; It&#039;s looking like we can&#039;t find what we want at all.&nbsp; Does anyone else feel the same?

				I would agree that the inventory is a bit low right now but $400k for a 1 bedroom still seems like a healthy budget to get what you want (and you may even get 2 bedrooms in some buildings). A quick search on streeteasy shows a listing in the Berkeley that meets your needs. There are also buildings like the Warwick which aren&#039;t technically in the landmark area (though you wouldn&#039;t know it) and don&#039;t have a garden (but do have a great outdoor sitting area) that you may like.

				It does look like the inventory for that category is really low.&nbsp; I thought there was one at Colonial Court on JH Listings, but I checked it on Streeteasy and it says it&#039;s in contract.&nbsp; Make sure you are checking all the realtor sites including the ones that don&#039;t place their listings on MLSLI, like MCP Properties.<br /><br />I guess if you feel like you want to try something different, you could do a postcard mailing to all residents in the buildings you&#039;re interested in to see if anyone is interested in selling.&nbsp; I get postcards frequently addressed to my unit number (no name) from realtors advertising their services by highlighting recent sales nearby.&nbsp; Also I once got a letter from a realtor saying they had a buyer specifically interested in apartments in my line in my coop, since I have a one bedroom that&#039;s the largest 1 bdr layout in the complex.&nbsp; Again, that did not come addressed to me, just my unit number, but I still received it no problem.<br />

				By the way, I believe the Warwick IS in the landmark district. It begins on the east side of 76 St and the Warwick is on that side of 76 St, between 76 and 77.

				We&#039;ll see how long this stays on the market at this price. Maybe it will be cut, maybe it will sell. $399 seems high to me, but there&#039;s a reason I&#039;m not in a pre-war.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Belvedere&#039;s garden is that it&#039;s really useable. Every time I walk by the Towers and look in, lovely as the garden is I&#039;ll maybe see one guy sitting in it. Maybe I&#039;m not walking by at the right times. But I see people using the patio/gardens at the Belvedere all the time. I live closer to the Belvedere, so there&#039;s that.

From acris, the only apartment that was closed for 5/20/2015 is 6G with the closing price of 475,000. Of course 6G is a two bedroom apartment, which demanded a higher price.<br /><br />For the same line of the building, there was a sale of apartment 2I closed on 09/29/2014 with the price of 335000. In lighting of this, the price of 399,000 for 6I is not too much out of the market (different renovation and different floors, also leaving room to cut down the price a little bit during the negotiation).

				The apartment that closed on 5/20/2015 for $225,000 was at the Belvedere East/West.&nbsp; It&#039;s on the second floor of the Belvedere West on 84th Street (Apt 2I).&nbsp; &nbsp;You can see this on Streeteasy.&nbsp; Type in 35-16 85th Street and this will give past listings for both buildings which is 35-16 85th Street &amp; 35-15 84th Street.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was told by an owner who lives at the Belvedere that the Garden is for the exclusive use of the 108 unit owners who live at the Belvedere East/West only and not the owners who live at the Belvedere on 35th Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since the unit being listed for $399K is not renovated and it&#039;s 850 SF not 950 SF it&#039;s way overpriced.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I trust the judgments of those who went to the open house. The moral may be, the right kinds of pictures can do wonders to drive people to an open house. I do though wonder at times what people at times consider &quot;unrenovated.&quot; When I bought my apartment, we bought it with 30 year-old carpeting, 1950s cabinets, and old 1980s laminate counter tops. That&#039;s what I think of as unrenovated. Admittedly, I think the pre- and post-war markets are a little different, different standards may apply.

				That unit is what I would call &quot;move-in condition&quot;. But renovated? Maybe 20 years ago...lol. Bad paint job, un-even walls, old stove, very old kitchen floors. Baseboards look very old, ceiling un-even and the hardwood floors don&#039;t look like they were refinished anytime recently.

				Shelby2:&nbsp; Many thanks for posting the floor plans for the 2nd Floor units in the &quot;A&quot; Section.&nbsp; The ST = Study.&nbsp; If you notice both the A27 &amp; A28 also have a small space that has a ST but are not studios.&nbsp; The studios were built with the wall.&nbsp; The &quot;B&quot; Section also has an identical unit on each floor so the building was built with 12 studios (2 1/2) with two very small additional studios (450SF) in the lobby floor one in the &quot;A&quot; &amp; &quot;B&quot; section.&nbsp; One just sold completely renovated for $205K.&nbsp; The 2 1/2 rooms units appear to be in the 650 - 675 SF range.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, the 84th St 1BR in the Belvedere that was originally listed for $350K and later reduced to $340K is in contract for $320K.&nbsp;

Like, a renovation is literally needed if you can&#039;t use the space for its intended use. Anything beyond that is a want. And, I&#039;m not sure how much ROI there is in tricking out your okay kitchen with middle grade finishes to a spectacular kitchen with high end finishes in a real estate market where prices are rising. (Complete dumps on the market over the winter and spring sold in my apartment complex for a decent chunk of change. Far more than what we paid for an apartment in better condition a little under two years ago.)<br /><br />I thought the photos of the kitchens were fine. Could I see someone wanting to change it? Sure, but it&#039;s not like those kitchens can&#039;t function in the meantime or that cooking in them would be a dreadful experience.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, one of the selling points for me on our current apartment is that while the kitchen was very dated, it was functional and we could use it no problem while we saved money for an eventual renovation.

				I actually thought that listing used renderings to add furniture in the photos. I wasn&#039;t sure about the kitchen, but I think that&#039;s real stuff in there. If it is, the kitchen isn&#039;t awesome, but it&#039;s serviceable and not falling apart. I guess we&#039;ll see what the market has to say about it. <br /><br />My gut says that JH is becoming a more desirable neighborhood, so much so that buyers will be willing to accept middle grade finishes that were standard in middle class households a decade ago in order to get in before prices become unreachable. Asking prices now are high enough that today I wouldn&#039;t be able to afford the 1 bedrooms that have sold in the last 6 months, including an estate sale I saw that was in such bad shape it made me sad to think someone had been living in those conditions.

				When I see the words gut renovated kitchen, I expect a room that now maximalizes use, new cabinets, stone countertops and high end appliances -- IF the asking price is top of the range for comparables. Many buyers, especially the kind coming in now, will be willing to pay top of the range for a great kitchen that they don&#039;t have to oversee the renovation on.<br /><br />When a kitchen has a serviceable layout, older but still in good condition cabinets, laminate or tiled countertops and older appliances it&#039;s not comparable to the above and I wouldn&#039;t expect to pay top of the range. <br /><br />I personally would rather buy the latter and do my own renovation to my own taste - but I wouldn&#039;t pay a top of range price and then lay out even more cash to give it a true renovation. And what I love to buy is one that hasn&#039;t been touched in decades with an asking price that reflects that condition.<br /><br />What&#039;s sad to me to see is a half-hearted renovation with builder grade cabinets, cheap granite and plastic stainless &quot;look&quot; appliances. That means someone just spent $10k to $15k to put put in a kitchen that I would need to replace, which means I&#039;d be paying for their renovation (as assumably they&#039;ve raised the price because it&#039;s &quot;renovated&quot;) plus my own renovation. Which I wouldn&#039;t do. If I&#039;m going to have to renovate, the home can&#039;t be commanding a top of range price.
