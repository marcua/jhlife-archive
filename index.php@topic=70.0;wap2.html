			here is a link to the sales info for the newly converted Stratford condos on 80th St and 35th Ave.<br />http://realestate.nytimes.com/sales/detail/857-102<br /><br />Seems like a pretty good (reasonable) price for a condo in the neighborhood these days.

			It is great to see a rental building make the conversion to condos. <br /><br />Is there any word on other rental buildings in Jackson Heights planning to convert?

			[Moderators note: moved here from another thread]<br /><br />About a year ago there were several articles about &#039;one of the biggest condo deals&#039; in NYC. It seems that Stafford Arms (or Hall), located on 35th Ave between 80th &amp; 81st was going condo. <br /><br />Has anyone out there heard any more about it? There was a flurry of ads, no pictures, in the Times real estate website, then nothing. <br /><br />I&#039;m not moving, but if there are affordable 1 and 2 bedroom apartments in the &#039;historic&#039; area available it would be nice to know, or attend an Open House, just to look.<br /><br />Months ago several agents in the nabe talked it up. Now?<br /><br />

			Didn&#039;t the Stratford Hall conversion involve something like 190 units or more?&nbsp; If I remember correctly, the conversion involved buildings located on 35th Avenue (the one named Stratford Hall), in addition to two other buildings located on 74th and 83rd Streets.&nbsp; All the talk seemed to be focused on the 35th Avenue building though.
