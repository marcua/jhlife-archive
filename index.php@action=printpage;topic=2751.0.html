				This store has been closed for at least 3 days.&nbsp; Does anyone know why?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a regular customer for many years and hope that they reopen.&nbsp;

				i was about to ask the same question...it&#039;s been more than a week, actually. i walked by last weekend to find the gates down. mail is piling up outside the door and the phone goes to a fax. hoping it&#039;s a temporary glitch -- there&#039;s still food in there, so perhaps?

				sadly enough, the gent outside the barbershop next door -- the owner, i believe -- told me they have gone out of business for good. he did not know why. went down the ave to monika and found that the lady who delivered entrees on friday seems to have shifted to their spot. stuffed cabbage just as good!

				I saw the woman who works behind the counter today on the street and couldn&#039;t help but ask her about the store.&nbsp; She said it is going to reopen next week!&nbsp; I hope that is true.&nbsp; We love some of their fresh salads.

				stopped in today and the shelves are still a little bare -- kind of a relief, since it shows they&#039;re not trying to peddle the old stuff -- but the same lady was holding down the fort. i didnt ask details, just welcomed her back and assured her they were missed.

				Salads are whitefish, mushroom, eggplant, tuna, russian and a green salad.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had all the salad and they&#039;re all very good.&nbsp; I was at the store yesterday and everything including cold cuts looked fresh.
