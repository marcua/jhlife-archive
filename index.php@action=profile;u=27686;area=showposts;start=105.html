					Thanks Dudley.<br /><br />I was on 78th play street with my son playing soccer this afternoon and saw the opened gate. However, nobody knew that the school yard was already open to public and nobody dared to get in to play. Next weekend, I will bring my son to try out the garden school yard with his soccer.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if a notice should be posted near the gate so that the local community knows when the yard is open to public to use.

					Thanks&nbsp; Beech Court for the insightful discussion.<br /><br />If &quot; a small quiet memorial&nbsp; park&nbsp; would be most appropriate, and likely could find support among the&nbsp; neighbors bordering the property&quot;, the public access is still required. If the alley is owned by the stores on the 35th ave and rented parking places, the city&#039;s only choice is to buy a house on Leverich Ave.<br /><br />I was looking at the &quot;<a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/Q017/history" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/Q017/history</a>&quot; you mentioned. According to the cityparks description (<a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/Q017/history" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/Q017/history</a>), the city spent $2.67 million on the improvements. I&#039;m sure if a powerful local politician can get this amount of money, it will be enough to entice a neighbor to sell his house and there is still money left to work on the improvements on the memorial park. <br /><br />By the way, the city spent $6 million buying the yard of garden school ($4 million was allocated by&nbsp; Daniel Dromm) so that the local community can use the yard outside the school hours. From the first post of this thread, Daniel Dromm is on top of this. Let&#039;s hope that he can get the resources and find a creative solution of the public access problem.<br />

					You are very knowledgeable on this topic.<br /><br />For the ownership problem, the natural solution is for the city to take over the place as as no one in the descendants of the Leverich family has taken the responsibility for many years to maintain the place and no one in the Leverich family has been able to claim ownership himself due to&nbsp; the potential conflict of interest of many other&nbsp; descendants of the Leverich family. <br /><br />The public access is not a huge problem. First the city also needs to clean up the area of the long arrow alley at 71st st and 35th ave that leads to the burial area. The next thing is probably to wait for many years until a single family house on the Leverich ave is up for sale. The city can bid up and buy the single family. Then the combination of the single family house and the burial place will have a much better public access to the Leverich ave.&nbsp; This works the same way as the city currently bought the garden&#039;s school yard, with the extension of the 78th play street,&nbsp; resulting in&nbsp; much more play space for the community. Jackson Heights definitely needs more community space for parks. <br /><br />

					This is some information I have seen in the jhfamilies email list. It sounds very interesting. <br /><br />By Clare Trapasso / NEW YORK DAILY NEWS<br />Thursday, April 11, 2013, 6:00 AM<br /><br />Jackson Heights leaders are trying to turn an abandoned 17th-century cemetery, dotted with garbage instead of grave stones, into a small park.<br /><br />City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) said he plans to organize a community cleanup of the Leverich Cemetery this spring. It is unclear if anyone is responsible for the overgrown cemetery as city records don’t list an owner of the small plot.<br /><br />“We have to take matters into our own hands and just clean this area up,” Dromm said, noting that a washing machine, half a motorcycle and feral cats now inhabit the land. “It’s become a dumping ground and nobody wants to take responsibility for it.”<br /><br />About a decade ago, a locked fence was installed around the cemetery, which sits behind some buildings near Leverich St. and 35th Ave. But the fence has long since fallen into disarray and the lock is broken, said local activist Martin Maier.<br /><br />“It should be converted into something useful — maybe a park or a memorial,” said Maier, who is leading the charge to clean it up.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/jackson-heights-locals-turn-abandoned-17th-century-cemetery-park-article-1.1312903#ixzz2QFZclZEr" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/jackson-heights-locals-turn-abandoned-17th-century-cemetery-park-article-1.1312903#ixzz2QFZclZEr</a><br />

However, I still stand correct (see NYC native&#039;s comments).&nbsp; If it&#039;s really a junior 4 as in your other examples, I&#039;m not too offended. Please read the layout&nbsp; of Armen&#039;s apartment I posted at reply #14 (Armen himself has already removed the floor plan on his web listing, not a surprise). I don&#039;t think you have ever looked at the floor plan of the apartment 2G&nbsp; (too lazy to click my link) I mentioned, see the attachment. As a matter of fact, I&#039;m not too offended when this apartment is listed as Flex-3BR as the one doesn&#039;t have to go to the kitchen for the third bedroom, however many honest brokers still list them as two bedroom two bath. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure jackson heights is my only choice. As I mentioned in the other post, I will look into Forest Hills, Rego Park and Elmhurst as well.

Such a typical language from a broker who claimed his co-broking is providing service for the buyers.<br />The buyer agent ultimately works for the seller as his commission comes directly from the seller. If there is no deal, the buyer agent gets nothing.&nbsp; The buyer agent will try to close the deal as quick as possible, there is no motivation for him to negotiate the best price for the buyer.<br /><br />Any buyer should ride the rollercoaster before he makes a decision to buy.<br /><a href="http://www.flixxy.com/real-estate-prices.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.flixxy.com/real-estate-prices.htm</a><br /><br />I was looking at the closed sale at redfin<br /><a href="http://www.redfin.com/NY/Jackson-Heights/7215-37th-Ave-11372/unit-2G/home/20637289" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.redfin.com/NY/Jackson-Heights/7215-37th-Ave-11372/unit-2G/home/20637289</a><br />The layout can be seen in the Columbia real estate brochure (<a href="http://nyre.cul.columbia.edu/items/view/44081" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nyre.cul.columbia.edu/items/view/44081</a>)<br />or from <a href="http://www.redfin.com/NY/Jackson-Heights/7215-37th-Ave-11372/unit-5G/home/20630657" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.redfin.com/NY/Jackson-Heights/7215-37th-Ave-11372/unit-5G/home/20630657</a> <br /><br />From the layout, Armen (agentarmen) and his friend Aram will list this as three bedroom two bathroom apartment since the dining room can be converted to a third bedroom. <br /><br />The owner of apartment 2G paid the price of&nbsp; 345000 in April 2008 (probably by following Armen&#039;s advice to always buy). <br />For some reasons he can not control (probably due to job relocation), in Sept 2012, he had to sell it for 285000, with a loss of 60000, adding the broker fee and closing costs of buying and selling and having to pay the maintenance fee for one year and a half for the apartment on the market. His total loss is at least 90,000.<br /><br />As I mentioned yesterday, if one has a very stable job (tenured professors, doctors and government jobs), he definitely should buy an apartment by taking advantage of the low interest rate as he can stay in the apartment forever. For the rest of us, we have to worry if job relocation or family size growth&nbsp; or a better school for the kids require us to move to another place, we need to consider carefully the re-sale price (on average, an American family moves home once in every 7 years).&nbsp; &nbsp;The low-interest rate of today will bite us several years down the road when the interest rate increases and the coop price comes down as fewer people can afford the mortgage.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m still struggling whether I should keep renting for a couple of years and then jump to the market after the government stops buying mortgage bond to keep the interest rate artificially low. <br /><br />

The Dept. of Finance records all sales, regardless of what brokerages took part in the sale.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If the listing apartments on Redfin or Streeteasy have been eventually closed, these sales will become part of the rolling sales data. However, the apartments that are on the market at Redfin or Streeteasy are a little bit over-priced or difficult sell (which may have been delisted and relisted for several times)<br /><br />Regarding whether local brokers or big companies are asking a higher price. My belief is that if a seller wants to sell quickly at a reasonable price, then he should go to a local broker to price it right. If a seller wants to maximize the profit, he wants to go to the big companies (who has no clues of the local market and just prices what the seller wants), but he needs to be patient and may wait a long time (maybe several yeas) for a non-market savy purchaser to buy his apartment as the big companies want to copy the Manhattan experience to jackson heights. I feel sorry for the non-market savy purchaser, who doesn&#039;t consider the re-sale price carefully. If the purchaser is going to stay at the apartment for more than ten years, everything is working for him.&nbsp; However, if the purchaser has to sell the apartment in several years down the road due to job move or bigger family size or better school for the kids, it will be very challenge to sell his apartment at the price he has bought, even worse, if the interest rate is increasing back to normal (say 6%) after the government stops keeping the interest artificially low,&nbsp; the price of the coop will probably be going to come down as fewer people are able to afford the mortgage. Is the first real estate bubble going to happen a second time?<br /><br />

					Hi Matt,<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I can post Daniel Karatzas&#039;s report unless I can first obtain his permission or he can post it by himself. &nbsp;Daniel Karatzas is a well regarded local realtor as other people (for example, Shelby2 just confirmed) in this forum have said. He only emails me once in three month for his real estate report and never emails me anything else.<br /><br />The floor plans of many of the well known buildings in Jackson Heights can be found at the Columbia real estate brochure <br /><a href="http://nyre.cul.columbia.edu/neighborhoods/view/QN28" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nyre.cul.columbia.edu/neighborhoods/view/QN28</a><br />In this way, you will precisely know the layout of almost all apartments of the building. As I said, combining rolling sales data and the building floor plan is not for an average joe, that is where Daniel Karatzas&#039;s report can help you.<br /><br />I will check out the RENBY later.<br /><br />Regarding redfin or mlsli or other big companies, you have exactly restated what I said: their price are over inflated and these apartments are difficult sells.<br /><br />Reply to Armen&#039;s comments, the junior 4 (larger than your stated flex 2 or whatever) can be found in Jackson Heights for around 250K even at redfin, mlsli or streeteasy or NYT times. &nbsp;Some shady brokers in craigslist can even stretch your listing to be as a three bedroom as one can wall off the living-room as a separate bedroom. I believe most buyers in Jackson Heights want to live like a family. Do we seriously like to live like a dorm town in Manhattan so the brokers can jack up the price as high in Manhattan? &nbsp;If that happens, most family will go to other areas for example (Forest Hills, Rego Park, Elmhurst) to find real homes.<br /><br /><br />

					Thanks Matt for the information<br /><br />In terms of recent sale data, the best resource is the department of finance <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/rolling_sales_data.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/rolling_sales_data.shtml</a> where you can download all of the sales data for from 2003-2012. I believe that&nbsp; is where Daniel Karatzas obtained the data to work on his report (<a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jhrealestatereport.com/</a>). For any one who wants to buy coop in jackson heights, he needs to seriously read Daniel Karatzas&#039; report (He just released this morning for Q4 2012). If you want to play the data like me, downloading all of the data from the department of finance and extract the data in your area to study them, that&#039;s where I found the price trend in my first post.<br /><br />For an average person,&nbsp; the acris mentioned by Matt <a href="http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/Scripts/Coverpage.dll/index" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/Scripts/Coverpage.dll/index</a> is the best place to go or read Daniel Karatzas&#039;s report.<br /><br />redfin is a little bit useless for price comp as a lot of apartments in jackson heights are exclusives and are not even advertised there because the local realtors don&#039;t want co-brokering. I heard stories that only difficult sell apartments will be advertised at<br />redfin or mlsli. <br /><br />All of the these info can not help myself as&nbsp; there are very few apartments in that building with that size, so the sale history is almost nonexistent. Using the relative price premium of adding one bathroom or half bathroom compared to a junior 4 from the same building at nearby location is the only way to guess the price of the apartment I am interested in. <br /><br />

					Hi Armen<br /><br />I admire your efforts to make fancy pages on the web site at <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jacksonheightslistings.com</a>. Somehow, the trick of misleading information or stretching the facts too much turns me away immediately. For example, you have listed the apartment 35-36 76th Street, #323 as a two bedroom apartment.&nbsp; Anybody looking at the floor can only consider it as &quot;ONE&quot; bedroom apartment. The dinning area can not be considered a separate bedroom (the flex room is such a fancy word). Even for a junior 4 in most jackson heights coop buildings, the dinning room that can be also served as a bedroom has its own walls and its closet and the kitchen has its own window. <br /><br />The floor plan is attached here so other people may examine it. I am hoping the reply does not get eliminated and you may revise your list to make my claim sounds unfounded and this is the last post I will comment on you web listing.

					Thanks for your suggestion of looking into other buildings to find out the premium. <br /><br />My previous statement is that a HIGHER price introduced by co-brokering is not good for the buyer.<br />The buyer and the seller are always on the two sides. A higher price is always good for the seller and a lower price is always good for the buyer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would have to say co-brokering may introduce more market efficiency due to the transparency and the fair market price can be determined very quickly so that both of the seller and buyer can have a good idea of the fair market price to have the sale closed quickly.
