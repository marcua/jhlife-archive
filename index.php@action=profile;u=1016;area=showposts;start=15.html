					The adulation of a drug addict who bought and paid for his children of whom he bears no biological relation, who home schooled his children and who kept his children hidden away from the world, dressing them in veils and masks and towels when paraded before the public or hung over balconies, not allowing them to play with other children is beyond my capacity to understand, unless, of course he was a pedophile.<br /><br />His family did nothing to either save him or the children who were his victims. &nbsp;I have personal knowledge of a what a drug addict can do to a child. &nbsp;It is beyond what decent people understand as even abnormal behavior. &nbsp;Instead of calling Family Services and the police, his family and friends and employees and/or colleagues did nothing. &nbsp;Britney Spears lost her children because she was a drug addict along with countless other entertainers for the same reason. &nbsp;Michael Jackson was given a free pass to a long slow death while those poor unfortunate children he bought had to watch this so called &quot;father&quot; kill himself because there was no one anywhere who had the courage to stop it.<br /><br />His trans gender appearance had nothing whatever to do with his sexuality and everything to do with his obsession for plastic surgery to make him more motherly looking for boys to be attracted to him. &nbsp;His fragile and victim like behavior is just what pedophiles do with their prey and society at large.&nbsp; Jackson was a smart and rich pedophile.&nbsp; Instead of going after children he had them come to him through&nbsp; his theme park erected in front of his home where they could ride the rides and play the games and stay overnight with him.&nbsp; He believed and publicly stated that his sleeping with children was absolutely fine and healthy ... even a good thing.<br /><br />Leonardo DaVinci, also had a predilection for teenage boys. &nbsp;He was rather outrageous and public in his behavior and for all his greatness and genius and stunning contributions to civilization, he served many years in jail for his crimes. &nbsp;He was not considered gay, like the majority of the geniuses of the Renaissance, because his partners were young boys ... not exactly children but too young for societal acceptance. &nbsp;Michael Jackson and his silly songs and stupid dancing like some Nazi thug paid never paid for his crimes. &nbsp;Nothing became Jackson so in life as his leaving of it. <br /><br />Let us be done with this man.<br /><br />Who was the Jackson in Jackson Heights?

					It&#039;s amazing and stunning and simply wonderful that there are so many concerned animal people in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; JHhomeowner and Madalyn thank you.&nbsp; You more than make up for the irresponsible clowns that allow their unneutered or even neutered animals out of the house.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a foundling that someone just threw out of a car according to the people in my building.&nbsp; He was seen running here and there but no one could catch him.&nbsp; I went out that very very cold winter night and there he was in&nbsp; a driveway.&nbsp; There are no strays in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I thought he was lost.&nbsp; I finally coaxed him out of his hiding place with a slice of baloney.&nbsp; Having just lost my beloved puppy to diabetes, he was going to go to the Humane Society or ASPCA.&nbsp; <br /><br />But he was just too miserable and sad and lonely and hungry to bring to a shelter.&nbsp; That was a year and half ago.&nbsp; Ruffian is still with me ... noisey, hyperactive, always getting into this or that and extraordinarily loving and surprisingly patient with children who are drawn to this ball of fur.&nbsp; He&#039;s been known to run through the building with children after him.&nbsp; He loves the run and they love the chase ... the noise is not so good but the hugs and kisses he gets and they get make Ruffian the best find ever.<br /><br />He&#039;s really quite wonderful.

					Michael Vick is a monster ... a very rich and successful and famous and powerful monstrosity.&nbsp; The walls of his sports arenas attached to the house in which he lived were covered in blood.&nbsp; He even had tables and chairs and booze and food for the onlookers affording his close friends with the best seats in the arena.&nbsp; He had rape rooms for female pit bulls who he bred without stopping.&nbsp; He even bred puppies to be used as prey for the fighting dogs to bite and chew on.&nbsp; He had torture chambers for the dogs who could or would no longer fight. He would beat them with chains and then tie them to the bloody chain.&nbsp; He&#039;d make them well enough and would beat them again with the same chain.&nbsp; Vick wanted them to smell their own blood.&nbsp; &nbsp;He had special equipment to kill the dogs no longer useful to him. They suffered the supreme torture.&nbsp; He would kill them slowly ... bringing them close to death with small doses of electricity.&nbsp; Reviving them and electrocuting them again all night and all day long until the poor animal finally died.&nbsp; The ones he hung died even worse deaths.&nbsp; Pit bulls have thick muscled necks so he hung them slowly tightening the noose.&nbsp; It would take hours.&nbsp; He fed the dogs the remains of those he killed.&nbsp; He reserved these activities for himself because he enjoyed the suffering ... slow and unimaginably painful.&nbsp; Ya think anything we decent people know is going to fix this burden to the earth!!!!<br /><br />In addition to the $50 plus million dollars he would make from football and endorsements, Vick made $10,000 to $20,000 at every fight in which his dogs won and he knew how to keep his killing machine underground.&nbsp; He enjoyed foiling the authorities who tried to stop him.&nbsp; Vick made it a family business.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t teach him about dog fighting.&nbsp; He taught them.&nbsp; They sent him to college.&nbsp; He was no backward poor slob.&nbsp; &nbsp;He was a smart college educated rich football player who knew how to run a criminal empire.&nbsp; He had the kind of money and power and smarts to invest in big houses on big pieces of real estate that afforded him&nbsp; all that privacy to endulge in his criminal actvities.&nbsp; &nbsp; He was the consumate sociopath and smart enough to abuse and profit from the least powerful in our society ... pets.<br /><br />The worst of what he did was revealed in the puppies that survived his house of death.&nbsp; Because his pit bulls became wards of the state when the government took his assets, the big bad government could not bring itself to kill these fighting dogs.&nbsp; The big bad government entered into an agreement with two professors of zoology with a specialty in animal behavior who believed they could rehab these animals.&nbsp; They came to take these dogs by night in vans and cars to a place they bought away from society.&nbsp; Out of the one hundred or so dogs they saved only two were beyond saving.&nbsp; They were psychotic.&nbsp; There was nothing that could be done for this poor unfortunates.&nbsp; They were euthanized.<br /><br />What the professors proved was astounding and amazing and tragic and heart rending and they caught it all on video tape.&nbsp; When these puppies were finally brought to their new rehab home and put in separate cages, they were not aggressive towards one another.&nbsp; There was no aggressive barking or growling at their former adversaries.&nbsp; The handlers could not believe what they saw.&nbsp; They expected the worst.&nbsp; The husband and wife professors knew better.&nbsp; Their theory about pit bulls was so radical it needed massive amounts of evidence to prove its authenticity.&nbsp; Even they were stunned by the immediate cordiality of the puppies and their complete lack of combativeness.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t there because Vick wasn&#039;t there.<br /><br />Their theory about pit bulls (they owned two of them) centered around a pit bulls unique devotion to their caretakers.&nbsp; The problem was that there was not enough observable evidence to prove it.&nbsp; Each day they allowed more and more puppies to gather and live together.&nbsp; No fighting and no aggression.&nbsp; But that is not rehab.&nbsp; They also had to be trained to live with families in a loving and non aggressive way.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; The puppies became loving and friendly and cuddly and sweet.&nbsp; They preferred to be with their human trainers more than anything and did everything asked of them.&nbsp; Aggression towards those they did not know was immediately and successfully stopped with a touch.&nbsp; Pit bulls learned fast what pleases their owners.&nbsp; And once the behavior was learned it was not forgotten.&nbsp; <br /><br />The rehabed puppies went to families with young children and not one incident ever happened.&nbsp; A few pit bulls who were too high energy to be around little children were placed with families with grown children&nbsp; or single owners.&nbsp; There were no incidents of biting or aggressive behavior towards other people.&nbsp; None!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; The proof was there.&nbsp; No editing.&nbsp; No staged instances.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of Vick&#039;s puppies&nbsp; were adopted out to families with children.&nbsp; The dogs were scrutinized like no other living creature because the government had to be sure that these so called &quot;killers&quot; could be redeemed.&nbsp; The puppies did not act out of hate.&nbsp; They acted out of love.<br /><br />Only the most hardened of people could not weep over this new found knowledge that &quot;fighting dogs/pit bulls&quot;&nbsp; were willing to fight and&nbsp; kill themselves to please their owner and Michael Vick knew his pit bulls loved him ... so much better to kill and torture and maim them if he felt they didn&#039;t love him enough.&nbsp; Perhaps they were in so much pain from proving themselves they physically could not fight or kiss him.&nbsp; &nbsp;They suffered fates worse than death because Vick had to punish them.<br /><br />The professors believed that although pit bulls are so anatomically constructed that their jaws are deadly, their ability and use for fighting does not stem from that anatomical killing jaw.&nbsp; It comes from pit bulls&#039; incredible almost insane love of their master for whom they will kill themselves if they know it pleases the person they love.&nbsp; Like racehorses who will run themselves to death to win, pit bulls will fight to the death for the love of their caretakers.&nbsp; Vick used their love of him to kill them and torture them and profit off of their suffering.<br /><br />He lied to PETA to gain their trust.&nbsp; He told them he only tortured and abused his fighting dogs.&nbsp; It was a lie.&nbsp; Witnesses saw him torture all his animals including his pets.&nbsp; So much for dog fighting as a cultural thing.&nbsp; Slavery was a cultural thing too.&nbsp; <br /><br />He profited and enjoyed the suffering of the helpless who loved him.&nbsp; God may forgive this monstrosity, the National Felony League may forgive this destestable scumbag, football lovers may not be able to do without this burden to the earth and the media will most certainly miss his disgusting presence but enough is enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope that if he returns to the public arena of football that there will be enough animal lovers and decent people in our society to boycott that sport and any product advertised by football.&nbsp; We&#039;ve brought down governments using this method and we can certainly bring down this Frankenstein NFLer. <br /><br />Vick should suffer as the animals he abused suffered.&nbsp; Jail is not suffering or rehabilitating.&nbsp; Jail is a place where people go to pay for their crimes and keep society safe for a time.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is also a place for people like Vick to instruct others on the art of torture and abuse of animals. He is beyond redemption. If he were sorry, he would creep into anonymity and work for almost nothing for a good cause.&nbsp; His shame and sorrow would cripple him.&nbsp; He would feel like a pariah and beg God on his knees for forgiveness.&nbsp; Not Mr. Vick.&nbsp; He&#039;s panting to get back in the game and the adulation of the fans and that is not redemption.&nbsp; That&#039;s getting away with everything.&nbsp; By time he gets through with his so called rehabilitation he&#039;ll have us believe the puppies abused him ... like OJ who always considered himself the real victim of his own crimes.&nbsp; And, there are people who&#039;ll believe him and forgive him and make him rich again.<br /><br />&nbsp;He should never be allowed near any animal ever again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope he dies as he lived in an arena of blood and suffering. I hope his blood smears the walls like those who bled for him because they loved him.<br /><br />Michael Vick thy name is killer.

					What ever happened to this play group?&nbsp; And, does anyone know if there is a puppy park for our wonderful pets?&nbsp; If not, we should get our politicians to start give us some space in one of our parks.&nbsp; There are probably more pet owners in JH than any other community except for maybe Sutton Place.

					I actually liked Monserrate!!!!!!!&nbsp; I must have lost my political mind.&nbsp; I was warned about his corruption but dismissed the warning because it came from a very wonderful but very leftist friend.&nbsp; This person, no matter the politics, is extraordinarily honest and forthright.&nbsp; That warning was an omen and that omen became a reality.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of his closest friends actually told me that Monserrate&#039;s girl friend fell into the glass but because she was jealous of his attention to some other woman made the accusation that he slashed her face.&nbsp; He still has his believers but I am no longer one of them and his girl friend ought to be charged with obstruction of justice.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a very bad guy.<br /><br />John Sabini was a brilliant politician and completely dedicated to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; He was responsive to our community and not intimidated by the local power mongers.&nbsp; It was always pleasant and productive to work with his office. He knew his way around New York politics without losing touch with his constituents.&nbsp; But, he drank too much and he drove when he drank and everybody looked the other way.&nbsp; &nbsp;He was a vehicular homicide waiting to happen. Thank heavens it never happened<br /><br />I hope he found help.&nbsp; I think he&#039;s working for the State in some other capacity.&nbsp; I only wished he would have stayed with us.&nbsp; He is missed.<br /><br />
