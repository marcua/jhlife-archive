			Anyone else waiting for a major newspaper to have an A1 headline, &quot;SORRY FOR THE OMICRON BS&quot;??<br /><br />Why must the world financial markets and travel industry be upended by this overblown news? How many variants have there been? There are new variants all the time. And nobody is even getting very ill from this one. What gives?

			With the anti viral pills and vaccines available...plus everyone knows the drill by now...the world is definitely in a better position than we were during the dark tunnel of 2020. <br /><br />So that&#039;s the positive. <br /><br />Medical science has saved us. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
