				I&#039;ve been wondering why it is taking so long to fill up the retail spaces in the Roosevelt Ave./74th Street subway complex.&nbsp; <br /><br />From The Real Deal (http://www.therealdeal.net) (hat tip NRV Lowdown (http://www.nrvlowdown.com/nyc/queens/jackson_heights)), here&#039;s an article that discusses the delays:<br />http://www.therealdeal.net/breaking_news/2007/10/22/1193093932.php<br /><br />Aside from the bad news about the delays, there&#039;s good news in the article that Koryodang CafÃ© (http://www.koryodang.com/) will rent the street-level retail space at 75th Street &amp; Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love their stores in Flushing and Manhattan, but the &quot;Koryodang Express&quot; near 72nd and Roosevelt just doesn&#039;t cut it for me.

				I was surprised by this &quot;bakery&quot; opting to sign a lease for the property next to the train hub.<br /><br />This neighborhood is not quite a draw for an asian bakery, those who desire such a thing, cross broadway to &quot;First Taste&quot;, an excellent bakery.<br /><br />It will be sad, but their failure, while not opened yet will be almost impending.<br /><br />Yet another vacancy and dilemma will develop, its a shame, more viable tenants should have been sought for the site.

				Koryodong already has a store two blocks away from this new location.&nbsp; If they were struggling, they wouldn&#039;t be looking to relocate and expand.<br /><br />The whole length of Broadway from the Roosevelt/74th Street station to Elmhurst and beyond has a high concentration of Korean businesses.&nbsp; It&#039;s not Koreatown or Flushing, but it&#039;s a thriving business district nonetheless.

				I don&#039;t know what used to be there, but you can see the old station in Hitchcock&#039;s &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; which<br />was filmed in Jackson Heights. Also, while he was here filming that movie, he was inspired to create <br />&quot;Rear Window&quot; by the interior courtyards in this neighborhood. I realize this doesn&#039;t really answer your question.

				There never was much of anything as far as retail goes. 20 years ago there was a store that sold drug paraphenelia ( I remember they used to sell High Guy t-shirts and remember buying some iron on patches for some T-shirts.&nbsp; There also used to a small arcade where all the kids who used to play hooky would hang out; there was your usual newspaper stand, a Ms. Fields cookie type of place which those who lived in the neighborhood for a long time would remember when they exited the station. By the entrance at one time there was a Nathan&#039;s but didn&#039;t last too long. Mostly stores that no one would remember.

				MTA staff have recommended approval of 10-year leases for retail spaces in the 74th &amp; Roosevelt subway complex:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>La Villita Records, which currently operates a store a block away from the station, wants to open a new 400 sq. ft. location inside the station.&nbsp; Rejected bids for this space included a gift and variety store, and a coffee shop</li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>A flower shop, in a 900 sq. ft. location inside the station.</li></ul><br />These leases are subject to approval by the MTA board.&nbsp; Hopefully we&#039;ll see something happening in the station soon.

				a very long time ago there used to be a number of shops underground as you entered the subway through the bus terminal.&nbsp; The only ones that come to mind are a small shoe repair shop and a newspaper stand. Upstairs there was a large cafeteria type place called Bickford&#039;s, a barber shop, a pizzeria, a hot dog place, another newstand, OTB parlor, annex to Elmhurst Hospital, men&#039;s clothing store,&nbsp; and a very very long time ago a Fannie Farmer chocolate store and I think a Cushman&#039;s bakery.&nbsp; I have lived here all my life.

				The problem with the MTA is that your are limited to what you can open, they will not let you sell any food or open a news paper stand. Not sure how the flower shop will work out.<br /><br />I wonder if they asked about the elevators sometimes they don&#039;t work so how would one get stock down to the shop? When I noticed that I said for get it...all it takes is one time.

				There used to be a flower shop on the mezzanine level in the subway for the longest time, and it was quite popular. Then they went and re-did the Victor Moore arcade which put all the retail that was there out of business. The nice thing back then was you could tell the token booth clerk you were going to the flower shop and they would let you through for free. Doubt that will happen now.

My memory is still pretty good since I lived on 74th off Broadway. Here is what I remember. OTB and a mens clothing store in the same alley as the upstairs clinic, A luncheonette next to the Q33 bus, Pizza Den, Hairsmith Barber Shop (which had a different name prior to that which escapes me), Fanny Farmer which became Frusen Gladje (sp?) Ice Cream, Bickfords Cafeteria which then become a combo Nathan&#039;s and Asian food by the pound. A German Deli which was right before the staircase to the downstairs. <br /><br />Second level down was a video and pinball arcade which later became a record store, a coin shop/collectible store, flower shop, a head shop, another barber shop, shoe repair, a newstand, a cookie shop that sold fresh baked cookies by the pound. <br /><br />Going back to street level there was a staircase next to Fannie Farmer that led up to offices that housed a dentist, a lawyer and perhaps a doctor. If memory serves there&#039;s a scene in the Hitchcock film The Wrong Man where Henry Fonda walks up that staircase and into the office area. Bickford&#039;s and the 7 train staircase can be seen in the film Queen of the Stardust Ballroom.

				Just walked by a short while ago and noticed a new web address on the store window. &nbsp;It looks like Backwoods is a $5.00 jewelry store that will be opening soon at the 74th Street subway station.<br /><br /><strong><em>Moderator Note:&nbsp; Link to site removed.</em></strong>

				It does nothing for me either, but I&#039;m not in the majority in this neighborhood. I think it will do well because that $5 watch dude outside the station seems to do gangbusters.

				Something funny is going on.<br /><br />When Chuckster first posted the link for Backwoods, I tried to pull it up and was having trouble getting the site. Now I tried it again and it comes up as a site called HaCKeD. Wonder what that&#039;s all about?<br /><br />(no offense Chuckster)

				it did have links that day, Chuckster......someone may have just targeted the people behind it? maybe duane reade needs the space to make up for their lack of local locations, and are trying to scare off the backwoods folks.... :P

				I wish Ottomanelli &amp; Sons were able to bid successfully (they tried but lost out).&nbsp; But I&#039;m ok with pizza. I&#039;ll be really happy if it&#039;s better than the mediocre options we have now.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder how 5 Guys would do around here.&nbsp; I should pray they never come to JH because I would gain a ton of weight.&nbsp;

				i like the 24 hour idea, i just wish it was someplace that served even acceptable food. baby steps. :)<br /><br />the subway seems to be gutted. it looked that way a week or so ago when i walked by late afternoon on a weekday and the gate was up a little. no surprise, since there are two on 37th ave within a few blocks...

				Thanks, I am not a big fan of Subway but I was just curious. I welcome another pizzeria<br />even though there are plenty of them around, not a big fan of franchise pizzerias.

				Two thoughts. While happy that the MTA will get rent from this space, and glad that the space is being used, I hope that the taco carts will be able to remain unmolested. (That&#039;s one thought.) The second thought is that as a native New Yorker, I find chain pizzerias in NYC to be an affront. Jon Stewart expressed it best-- about the same pizza chain headed to our neighborhood: http://eater.com/archives/2011/06/02/jon-stewart-flips-out-over-donald-trumps-pizza-choice.php (http://eater.com/archives/2011/06/02/jon-stewart-flips-out-over-donald-trumps-pizza-choice.php)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Interesting concept for subway retail, though it would probably require cell phone reception in the subway platform:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0d5i6YxRYI<br />
