				<strong>Learning CPR just got a little easier. </strong> <br /><br />The FDNY has partnered with NYC Service and New York Sports Clubs (NYSC) to launch <strong>FDNY CPR to Go</strong>, a program that offers free CPR classes at gym locations throughout the five boroughs. <br /><br />Participants in every class learn basic CPR skills from a member of the FDNY Emergency Medical Service. Volunteers for the class follow along using the CPR Anytime Personal Learning Kit, which features an instructional DVD and an inflatable mannequin. All participants are asked to take home the kit and pledge to show five of their family members and friends how to perform CPR.<br /><br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/general/registrations/cprtogo/index.shtml<br />Thank you for your interest in FDNY&#039;s CPR To Go Program! This free, hour-long class will teach you how to save the life of an adult or child. <br /><br />The Department will offer CPR training to the public at both Department Facilities and participating New York Sports Club locations throughout the five boroughs. Everyone who completes the training will receive a free, transferable week-long pass to NYSC for you or a friend.<br /><br />The program is designed to teach you how to save your Family and Friends.&nbsp; The course does not provide certification. <br /><br />As part of the class, you will be asked to pledge to give back by sharing your knowledge with five other people. To help you do so, you&#039;ll get to take home your CPR training kit, complete with an inflatable training doll and training DVD in English and Spanish.<br /><br />To sign up, click the link above and pick your preferred location. <br /><br />For further information contact the FDNY&#039;s CPR Training Unit at Telephone Number: 718-281-3888<br />
