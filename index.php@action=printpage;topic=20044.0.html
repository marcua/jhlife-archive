				Has anyone else been getting a lot more spam calls than usual? Just this week I&#039;ve been getting about 5 per day with area codes all over NY, with the noticeable exception of&nbsp; the usual NYC area codes. I used to get them from 917 (which is what my number starts with) and now they are coming from 518, 516 and 914, which are all within NY state, but not within the 5 boroughs.<br /><br />I block the number after they call but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s doing any good.

				I would never answer a call from a number not listed in my contacts.<br /><br />Actually, I would pretty much only answer a call from someone who has texted first to arrange a call. <br /><br />Isn&#039;t that protocol these days so that we don&#039;t have to worry about Spam/Robo calls?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been getting a lot less since the mid March from about 15 calls a week to about 3.&nbsp; I never pick up the phone if I don&#039;t recognize who is calling.&nbsp; When I was getting a repeat caller, I would press &quot;block call&quot; and they couldn&#039;t get through.

My phone usually says “Spam Likely” on the display to alert me not to answer. It’s pretty annoying to have my phone ring with spam calls an extra 5x per day, whether I answer or not. Also if my phone is not right next to me, I end up interrupting what I’m doing to see who’s calling. I know, first world problems :)

				I just realized my phone has an option to silence unknown callers. I will use that on days when I’m not expecting calls from unknown numbers (like delivery drivers or couriers).

				i have the &quot;spam likely&quot; notification, too, but i notice it seems to trigger due to any machine-generated call, whether it&#039;s an unwanted robocall or an automated reminder of a medical appointment (my doctor is at Mt. Sinai, which uses this)

				I have been getting the same call this week about offering me these 11 pills that are free from my insurance. They have some info but others are a little wrong. It is super shady.<br /><br />This is why I have a fake number that I provide to companies if they never have a reason to call me.
