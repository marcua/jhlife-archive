SO, it&#039;s OK if WHITE yuppies move into the neighborhood - but what about &quot;shades of brown&quot; yuppies? Or do we not assume that people of color can ALSO be young urban professionals. I&#039;m not sure I understand the subtext when people thoughtlessly put white and yuppie together. Can&#039;t we get beyond that simple characterization? It is so subtly insidious that people probably don&#039;t even notice. <br /><br />Here is my opinion - I LOVE the fact that this neighborhood is attracting a new crop of young singles and couples (both gay and straight) who are excited to be involved and excited to build a sense of community with their neighbors. These are folks ready to volunteer in neighborhood activities, serve on their coop boards, fight for more resources for our schools, and address issues like traffic, street cleanliness, etc. And I LOVE the fact that these professionals are both white AND puerto rican, black, cuban, philipino, korean, polish, british, argentinian....etc. That diversity is what makes me know that Jackson Heights is the place I want to make my home and the place I want to raise my children. And I&#039;m not concerned about JH changing as a result of this influx. Frankly, the Historic District has always been a bit different, demographically speaking, than the surrounding neighborhoods because of the history of exclusion (for better or worse) that has been mentioned previously. But think about it, if you take a bike ride to surrounding neighborhoods, they do not have the kind of attractive housing stock or the kind of transportation access (think of north of Northern and some places in Elmhurst and Corona), to ever attract the crowd that seems to be interested in Jackson Heights right now. This is the crowd with jobs in Manhattan for whom easy access to midtown is vital. So even if JH gets yuppified as older residents start turning over apartments to a new crop of Jackson Height&#039;ers, I have a feeling that we will always be surrounded by diverse communities that will keep us grounded in the reality of class AND ethnic diversity (and with access to great, authentic ethnic food - thank G-D! B/C that&#039;s why I&#039;m really here! <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />. <br /><br />Can you tell that I love this place? <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					<strong>Mainstream Movies </strong> - take the R/V/G to Steinway and walk to UA Kaufman Astoria theatres for first run movies. <br /><strong>Artsy Movies </strong> - Kew Gardens Cineman on Lefferts Blvd. is a good local&#039;ish place to see artsy movies - better than going to manhattan. And you can cross the street and have great pub food at Austin Ale House. <br /><br /><strong>Chain Stores: </strong> Take the R/V/G to 46th and walk a long block south to Marshall&#039;s/Old Navy/Chucky Cheese/Home Depot.&nbsp; <br /><strong>Mall: </strong> Take the R/V/G to Woodhaven and you&#039;ll be at a Queens Center Mall - pretty conventional mall where you can find Macy&#039;s and JC Penney. <br /><strong>Atlas Park: </strong> Take the 29 bus from 82nd Street to Atlas Park - a strange european like mall with a few decent restaurants and nice open space with a fun kid friendly water fountain. The shopping sucks though - they are still working on filling vacancies. But they also have a movie theatre that is decent, and an Amish Marketplace. Oh, I shouldn&#039;t forget the large Barnes &amp; Nobles. Driving there is a better idea....<br /><br /><strong>Bowling Alley/Ping Pong/Pool/Fooseball </strong> - there is a decent and fairly nice place to do all of these things. BQE Billiards and the bowling alley are at 34th Avenue and 71st or so...about a ten minute walk from the historic district. They have a nice bar too - sort of sportish. <br /><br /><strong>Jewelery/Framing: </strong> European Gallery/Franco&#039;s Corner on 35th around 84th. Franco has some nice antique jewelery. I have used the Gallery for framing quite a bit, but I think they are overpriced and a bit rude. <br /><br />Newman Jewelers on 35th Between 78th and 79th has beautiful china (Kate Spade, Vera Wang, ect) at very good discount prices. <br /><br /><strong>Clothing</strong><br />Famous Brands - Roosevelt and 78th. Cheap, cheap, cheap clothing from relatively well known brand name companies like NY&amp;Co, Liz Claiborne. <br /><br /><strong>EFN Zone </strong> - a gym right above Famous Brands. The only real full service gym in the &#039;hood. They are VERY inexpensive too - but I found too crowded after work and the aerobics instructors were poorly trained. They do very little warm up.<br /><br /><strong>Corona Ice King in Corona </strong> around 103 and 55th Avenue or so - an EXCELLENT thing to do on a weekend night in the summer is go to Corona Ice King, get a lemon ice (or a gourmet flavor if you choose) and sit and watch the men play boci (sp?) in Spaghetti Park (that&#039;s a nickname...but it sticks....) Watch out for loose bocci balls....<br /><br />I used to live in Manhattan - and now I barely ever leave Queens! My good friends in Brooklyn who are still renting are jealous! <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

					I remember buying my apartment and overhearing a realtor training while i was sitting in the office. The leaders were instructing their staff not to take anything lower than 4% - in a way that strongly suggested that they were willing to negotiate on this point. Perhaps the market has changed - but negotiating seems prudent. I also remember them saying &quot;we don&#039;t take less than 4% - we are not Foxtons&quot; - so maybe you should check out Foxtons. Here&#039;s a link for a few JH listings. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.foxtons.com/for-sale/real-estate-in-jackson-heights-queens-ny-usa-773/real-estate-for-sale-in-jackson-heights.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.foxtons.com/for-sale/real-estate-in-jackson-heights-queens-ny-usa-773/real-estate-for-sale-in-jackson-heights.html</a><br /><br />I don&#039;t think they are as aggressive with listings as some realtors based in JH - so there is always that tradeoff...

					I just posted this somewhere else - but I think Jardi&#039;s on Northern between 84 and 85 is great. Novo&#039;s is good food, they put alot of thought into the menu. Inti Raymi has the most amazing Lomo Saltado and ceviche I have tasted in a long time. Uncle Peter&#039;s on Northern is also good. Raj Bog on 37th between 72 and 73 is good for fast indian food.

					I guess if I were using a local realtor who I trusted and I put a bid in through them and they continued to actively list the place when I *thought* they were on my side - it would bother me. Ethics is about what is fair - and this doesn&#039;t seem fair to me.

					There are some creative ways to use space that work to discourage loitering of the kind folks are talking about. Consider Bryant Park - it used to be a poorly designed space that encouraged vagrancy, but is now a place that encourages use by regular folks (which in turn serves to discourage use by drunks). Partnership for Public Spaces is a good NYC-based non-profit that helps communities brainstorm about design solutions that work for spaces like this. It IS possible.

					Is it ethical for a realtor to continue to list a property after they have recieved an offer and it has been accepted by the buyer? It seems slimey, but my understanding is that if the realtor represents the seller, it&#039;s ok. I have noticed that JH Landmark realty is doing that with some listing on craigslist and it just struck me as pretty unethical. Does anyone know for sure?

					Raw rent numbers don&#039;t tell us a thing. We cannot form an opinion about rents on 37th avenue without doing a comparative analysis. According to the previous post, the former Greenpoint space on 37th Avenue is 300,000k for 3,400sf - which is about $88/sf a year (I&#039;m not sure given the information whether this includes basement space. If it does, the rent is less than $88/sf)<br /><br />Consider this - on some major commercial strips in Manhattan rents are almost $300/sf a year on average. The average for all of Manhattan, both major and minor corridors, was about $100/sf a year. See the attached article: <a href="http://www.huliq.com/2530/manhattan-retail-rents-continue-to-surge" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.huliq.com/2530/manhattan-retail-rents-continue-to-surge</a><br /><br />I also read another article where asking rents on Austin Street in Forest Hills (which supports a healthy mix of national and local retailers) is about $150/sf. Frankly, for some businesses $88/sf might be a good deal. The only thing that keeps a retailer from paying these rents is whether they make enough profit from customers to do so. Clearly, many of them can and do if they provide the right mix of goods, at the right price, with the right level of service. If they donâ€™t, they go out of business. Thatâ€™s not something that any of us can change with discussion on a listserve. Thatâ€™s economics. <br /><br />I should add that the one thing that may skew these rents is money laundering and drug dealing. Getting police involved may be necessary to ensure that these illegal activities do not cause average rents to rise. Legitimate businesses cannot compete against illegal businesses, and they shouldnâ€™t have to. <br />

					I just went into the Neiman porcelain shop today, and frankly was really surprised by the quality (and prices - almost everything is 40% off the posted price). They sell beautiful Vera Wang and Kate Spade place settings at a price very competitive with department stores. They even do registries. The owner has parkinsons(?) but is there all the time. Very nice guy. Cleary they need to improve their presentation. The front window displays look like they haven&#039;t been changed in 20 years - very dusty and grimy - and they certainly don&#039;t show off their nicest stuff. It&#039;s too bad, because the employee there mentioned that their customers come to them from Long Island and further, but there are not too many local folks who venture in and buy. This place needs a really good manager to shake things up. They could start selling over the internet as well - but the owner is not that computer saavy.
