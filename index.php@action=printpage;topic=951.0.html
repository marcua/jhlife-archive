				Well the guys pushin&#039; the hookers are still on the streets.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that the cops and the politicians didn&#039;t do anything, but I want to know what they DID do...<br /><br />I support cops cuz they&#039;re job is real real tough.<br /><br />I remember I posted this forum a while back (maybe another thread)<br /><br />so like besides posturing, what DID happen to clean things up on Roosevelt Ave.?<br /><br />where the guilty parties ever apprehended?

				Two arrests... maybe gang related:<br /><br />http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19768683&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574903&amp;rfi=6<br /><br />Roosevelt Ave is still pretty much the same, change will take time, fortunately incidents like this are rare for the neighborhood so it&#039;s still safe, but still not so pretty.
