			Many thanks for all the memories. I first landed here after the Starbucks buzz. Was it covered in the NYT and there was a link in the article here? This board has helped me discover many of the fine cuisines in the neighborhood.<br />

			So sorry to hear this site is closing. It really is the best option out there. There is Next Door Jackson Heights and several Facebook groups but neither has the breadth of content or as useful a structure.&nbsp;

			Sorry to hear the site is closing.<br />I beg to differ that the forum format has outlived its usefulness. If anything social media like Facebook is the reason why this has still been active, and it is not a favorable alternative after December 31st<br /><br />If you are unable to continue the domain and website it is certainly understandable and I&#039;m very grateful to have found and referred to JHL.
