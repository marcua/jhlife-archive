				Looking for responsible local individual who is available to come to small property to sweep sidewalk 5 mornings per week.<br />In addition, you would be responsible for watering garden every other day (unless it&#039;s raining) as well as setting out garbage Sunday and Wednesday evenings for sanitation.<br /><br />This is a 10 apartment building.&nbsp; Pay for the above would be $200 for the month.<br /><br />If interested, please email:&nbsp; dachomejh@gmail.com<br /><br />Thank you.<br />

				So someone has to come by your place <em>28 separate times every month</em> and gets paid 200 bucks?<br /><br />Even if you break it down by hour, this is incredibly stingy. <br /><br />So, 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month, for &quot;1h&quot; = 20 hours. (it might only take 15-30 mins to sweep and put out garbage, but this person has to get to your place.....)<br /><br />Plus Sunday/Wed evenings, at different times, for &quot;4h&quot; = lets generously say 30 mins to do the garbage+travel (same argument....)<br /><br />24 hours, $200 bucks. $8.30 an hour, max.

				Lalochezia:&nbsp; I agree with you.&nbsp; DAC is looking to pay slave wages and will attract no one. A disgrace.&nbsp;

				As far as cash honorarium, this is in the ball park of what coops this size pay. However, they also usually offer an apartment for the super to reside in, which changes the equation considerably. Typically, buildings in the neighborhood that hire a part-time super without an apartment, pay about 2-3x that. But maybe this has worked in the past for that building. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I would think this worker is technically a porter, rather than a super.<br /><br />But a job often gets bigger than you bargained for... sweeping includes cleaning up dog poop, watering can mean pulling weeds, taking garbage out may require sorting, etc etc etc
