				Liberty Bagel, a nice ,full service bagel place located in midtown is opening a store on Roossevelt &amp; 82nd. Yay! This is the real deal. Don&#039;t know when it&#039;s opening but the sign is up and they are doing work inside.

				They are EXTREMELY popular with tourists. I don&#039;t even know where they came from. I think it&#039;s instagram famous bc the bagels get crazy. Strange they are coming here.

				Agree interesting they are opening here on Roosevelt.&nbsp; Good to see they have a location in mid-town with good reviews.&nbsp; Would have preferred a more chill bagel place/cafe like New York City Bagel and Coffee, or Brooklyn Bagels away from Roosevelt, but any decent bagel shop in Jackson Heights is great news.

				Bagel House on Northern and 89th has very good bagels that I believe are kettle boiled, but another much closer addition to the neighborhood is great.

They were offering samples of their cream cheeses so you can figure out what you like. I tried samples of their blueberry, birthday cake, walnut raisin, avocado and herb, bacon scallion and lox spread cream cheeses. All were good (although the birthday cake one was pretty much just frosting as you would expect). The savory ones were my favorite though.<br /><br />They also had souvlaki in the back. Looked good. Hope to try those soon. And a wide variety of baked goods (muffins, cakes, puddings etc) in the front.<br /><br />The owner was there and seemed like a nice guy.

				Wow. It&#039;s a classic old style New York bagel store.<br /><br />With tables and chairs even.<br /><br />And it&#039;s a pretty big space.<br /><br />There was a classic bagel store on 86th and 37th Ave but it didn&#039;t last...it&nbsp; turned into a Greek and then vaguely Latin restaurant and is now becoming a chicken joint.<br /><br />So I hope this place lasts. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Are the prices cheaper than Manhattan or the same? Still happy to see a local business expanding.

				Their bagels are very good, fresh, didn’t need toasting. They have all the usual spreads and sandwich choices (lox, eggs, cream cheese), plus many novel flavors like (jalapeño cream cheese and colorful bagels). Really glad they’re here in the neighborhood.

Brooklyn bagel is still the best in Queens but this is pretty close. And no need to go out to Astoria.

				LOVE LOVE this place!! The prices are great and the food is super fresh. I can get a customer made salad for 5.00!!! Bagels are boiled and top notch. They have a good variety of spreads including a great tofu spinach/artichock and scallion. Service is good, fast and the place is beautiful.
