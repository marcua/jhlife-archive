Gimbels.&nbsp; Love it!!

				Getting in or out of the subway station, or making connections between the IRT and IND&nbsp; was becoming impossible with the increasing volume of people. Also the new busses were too tall for the terminal. <br /><br />The whole block was demolished and a new terminal was built. The Q19B still runs but is now called Q49.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jackson_Heights-Roosevelt_Avenue-74th_Street.jpg
