					Hello everybody! I wanted to take a moment to share a very touching story which we just published. <br /><br />--<br /><br />Buyer Goes Above and Beyond to Bring Seller Closure<br /><br />It was one of the most touching and gratifying experiences in our years of practice. Our seller client, initials JT, enlisted our help in selling her late mother’s apartment in Jackson Heights. She had many memories connected with the apartment and the sale was an emotional experience for her on many levels.<br /><br />We found her a great buyer, initials RK, who planned a complete renovation of the apartment, which it certainly needed. What made this special was that the new buyer, RK, went out of her way to invite us and the seller to see the apartment post renovation and allow the seller to have complete closure and assurance that the home fell into the right hands. It was visible how healing this experience was for JT!<br /><br />I can’t begin to tell you how emotionally gratifying this was for all of us. It was only fitting that we took everyone out to lunch and celebrate the fact that such things still exist in our world, and more so right here in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />It’s been an honor and a privilege to be part of this experience!<br /><br />Link to the original article:<br /><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/buyer-goes-above-and-beyond-to-bring-seller-closure/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/buyer-goes-above-and-beyond-to-bring-seller-closure/</a><br />

					I received a call from a woman who googled my name and contacted me about an email exchange which the thought was coming from me.<br /><br />The sender stated that she was chosen as a candidate for the rent controlled property for a low monthly rent and proceeded to ask for a deposit and first month&#039;s rent. Because this woman happened to be looking for a rental she engaged in the exchange, then her husband found it suspicious and they searched and called me. I should add that the sender also created a fake email account through outlook using my last name. We reported it to Microsoft, and they took appropriate action on their end.<br /><br />This is obviously a new fishing scam which uses known agents names in <br />your area. Easiest way to detect them is that no office phone and address are in the signature line of the communication - which happens to be a legal mandate of the NY Department of State. When in doubt, call the brokerage main number to verify authenticity. <br /><br />If you have received similar emails please share them on this post as well.<br />

					This is interesting: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150212/jackson-heights/landlord-plans-rooftop-addition-jackson-heights-historic-district" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150212/jackson-heights/landlord-plans-rooftop-addition-jackson-heights-historic-district</a><br /><br />JACKSON HEIGHTS — The owner of a building in the neighborhood&#039;s Historic District has filed an application with the Landmarks Preservation Commission to build on top of his ground floor shops, according to city records.<br /><br />Charlie Patel, who owns 84-11 through 84-23 37th Ave., applied for the change on Dec. 30, 2014, including a &quot;rooftop extension&quot; and replacement of windows and doors, according to the agency. <br /><br />In 2011, the owners of the strip of stores next to Patel&#039;s began the hearing process to build a six-story apartment building on top of a strip of stores that had been gutted in 2010 by a fire.<br /><br />The apartment building opened last year.<br /><br />Since the building is in the neighborhood&#039;s historic district and landmarked, all construction work must get approval from the city agency.<br /><br />Permits with the Department of Buildings have not yet been filed for the project and it&#039;s unclear what type of extension Patel plans.<br /><br />A hearing for the proposal has not been scheduled, according to a spokeswoman for the LPC.<br /><br />The fate of the seven stores on 37th Avenue, including Kelly&#039;s Cleaners, the Jackson Heights Furniture Shop and Value Fabrics, is not clear.<br /><br />The owner of Kelly&#039;s Cleaners, Alex Chin, said he&#039;s on a month-to-month lease and is not sure what&#039;s going to happen to his business, which he&#039;s owned for seven years.<br /><br />&quot;We can stay here month to month until they get permits,&quot; he said of his shop at 84-11 37th Ave. &quot;There is no lease.&quot;<br /><br />But Alberto Sosa, who owns Jackson Heights Furniture at 84-15 37th Ave., said he has a three year lease and hasn&#039;t heard any plans for construction. <br /><br />Patel did not immediately comment. <br /><br />His lawyer, Howard Weiss with Davidoff, Hutcher and Citron LLP, did not respond to a call or email seeking comment.<br />

					Wanted to share our latest article on Jackson heights pricing projections, which corolates with an article dating back to May 30th 2013. Direct link: <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/2015-jackson-heights-real-estate-pricing-projections/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/2015-jackson-heights-real-estate-pricing-projections/</a><br /><br />---<br /><strong>2015 Jackson Heights Real Estate Pricing Projections</strong><br />October 19th, 2014<br /><br />You may recall the article we published on May 30th 2013 titled Unemployment Improves, Jackson Heights Real Estate Market Soars, where we projected quote: “median price for renovated Jackson Heights one bedroom units will reach $300,000 + in the coming year and two bedroom units will trade in the area of $450,000.” With that prediction proving accurate I believe now is a time for a new projection.<br /><br />Based on everything we are experiencing first hand, we now believe that towards the fall of 2015 median price for renovated one bedrooms in Jackson Heights will reach $350,000 and median price for renovated two bedrooms will reach $525,000.<br /><br />Though we take pride in our consistency of being in tune with our local market, our projection from May 30th of 2013 was based strictly on professional instinct. Today we are projecting based on many other markers already present in our marketplace and in a much healthier economic environment.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.JacksonHeightsListings.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.JacksonHeightsListings.com</a><br />

					<strong>Prepare Property For Sale in 15 Easy Steps</strong><br />Link to the original article: <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/for-sellers/prepare-property-sale-15-easy-steps/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/for-sellers/prepare-property-sale-15-easy-steps/</a><br /><br />We are often asked by our seller clients for suggestions how to prepare property for sale. More often than not, the most effective things are very inexpensive or free of cost to implement.&nbsp; We have compiled a highly condensed list in the order of effectiveness.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>FLOORS</strong><br /><br />Floors are often the first thing that buyers see before they raise their heads to view the rest of the property. We understand that many buildings have carpeting requirements or that certain area rugs are essential to match the esthetic of the owner’s décor. However, keep in mind that the property is now for sale, and buyers need to be able to clearly see what they will be purchasing.<br /><br />Show Your Best Floor: If you have an area rug or a wall to wall carpet covering a beautiful hardwood floor – get rid of the rugs. This is especially essential in vacant apartments.&nbsp; Carpeting over quality hardwood floors diminishes value perception.<br /><br />Minimize Items Taking Floor Space: be judicial as to which items taking up your floor space are necessary for your day to day for the next three months. Less items you have on the floor, the better the property will show.<br /><br /><strong>WINDOWS</strong><br /><br />Especially during daytime showings, windows draw the eye like no other item in a property. Here are items that can be easily addressed:<br /><br />Window Treatments: Unless you have beautiful window treatments that add value to your window frame&nbsp; – remove them!<br /><br />Window Glass: More often than not buyers are turned off when seeing dirty or fogged up windows. In some cases basic cleaning will resolve this problem, in others glass replacement is recommended. New glass can cost between $150-$200 per window to replace – yet this improvement will dramatically change buyer perception.<br /><br />Window Sill: Window sills often take a beating over time, it is important they are well cleaned and patched as needed.<br /><br />Window Frame/Mechanic Parts: Some window frames take significant wear, and the mechanism that holds them up when open or opens them up for cleaning is often rusty or damaged. Repairs may often become a condition of your sale, or if negotiated out of the contract may produce lower offers.<br /><br /><strong>KITCHEN</strong><br /><br />It is often said that kitchens sell apartments. In some cases this is true, but what we find that sells kitchens is overall cleanliness clutter free space.<br /><br />Declutter – extra kitchenware, fridge magnets, decorative items taking up counter space etc. can be boxed up.<br /><br />Show Your Plumbing – no one wants to sift through a wall of cleaning products or plastic bags under the sink to see what the plumbing below looks like. Clear the way, and if plumbing below looks questionable or leaks – have a plumber look at it before going on market.<br /><br />Tighten All That’s Loose – hinges, handles, faucet parts – all can be tightened.<br /><br />Fix All That’s Leaking – leaky faucet or a pipe can give a very bad impression and have impact on value. Make sure it’s fixed before going to market.<br /><br />Mind Your Sprays – be selective as to which cleaning or other products you show your potential buyers. Quantity of cleaning products can also be addressed, in effort to decrease clutter you can opt to keep the essentials and box the rest.<br /><br /><strong>LIGHTING </strong><br /><br />Install Highest Wattage Bulbs Your Fixture Can Handle – artificial lighting should make maximum impact when turned on during showings.<br /><br />Clean and Dust All Your Light Fixtures – this is an item often missed since fixture dust if often out of sight. Buyers seem to zone in on them, and if they see clean fixtures it sends a message that it’s a well kept property.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>COLORS:</strong><br /><br />Your belongings and fixtures are your own pallet, but when it comes to the wall color ideally you’d want to have -<br /><br />Mat Finish Walls – mat finish is less likely to showcase imperfections<br /><br />Light and Neutral Colors: light colors bounce light instead of absorbing it, hence making a property brighter and showcase natural light that the property actually gets and open you up to a wider buyer pool.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>PS. If you are still occupying the property&nbsp; and need help keeping it consistently clean and neat, consider hiring a weekly cleaning service. They average $75-$100 per cleaning.</em><br /><br />We hope that you find these suggestions helpful and easy to implement. We are happy to provide individual consultations on this subject matter as well.

					Hi everybody. I wanted to share an article I recently wrote. This data should prove helpful for folks having trouble selling or refinancing one bedrooms due to low appraisals.<br /><br />Link: <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/highest-one-bedroom-coops-sold-jackson-heights/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/highest-one-bedroom-coops-sold-jackson-heights/</a><br /><br />---<br /><br />Highest One Bedroom Coops Sold in Jackson Heights!<br /><br />In a rising market, one of the toughest challenges Sellers and Realtors face are low appraisals conducted by independent third party appraisers if financing is being used. Several deals have fallen through or been sent back to a negotiation table due to the disparities between the agreed upon contract price and the bank appraisal.&nbsp; Low appraisals are often a result of lack of comparable sales within the building or the surrounding area. It seems the increased values due to recently seen bidding wars are being adjusted downward.&nbsp; I am happy to say that we now have at least three shining examples of recent sales on public record that may help turn things around.<br /><br />37-30 73rd Street, #6E – 1bed 1bath Closed at asking $318,000 on April 10th 2014<br />35-24 78th Street, #A55- 1bed 1bath Asked $325,000, Closed at $315,000 on March 6th, 2014<br />35-36 76th Street, #523- 1bed 1bath Asked $309,000 Closet at $300,286 on January 14th 2014<br />Marketplace is always changing, and in our experience consumers are much faster to respond to it, and if their demand is loud enough, lenders will begin to embrace change as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />PS. This data is also important for owners who tried refinancing in the past, were discouraged from doing so due to low appraisals.

Airoldi on February 28, 2014 7:40am <br />Slideshow&nbsp; Open houses for those on a budget. <br />The kitchen and dining area of the floor-through in the townhouse at 186 E. 111th St., Apt. 1, in East Harlem. This two-bedroom is listed for $500,000. View Full Caption<br />NEW YORK — Luxury apartments may make nice eye candy, but budget-conscious buyers need practical spaces that represent a good deal as well as a good investment, like these five apartments. <br /><br />33-35 81st St., Apt. 6D, Jackson Heights, Queens<br />1 Bedroom/1 Bath<br />Co-op<br />Approximately 650 square feet<br />$177,500<br />Maintenance: $574 per month<br />Open House: Sunday, March 2, 1 to 2:30 p.m.<br /><br />Lowdown: Many apartments in Jackson Heights offer good value, but this one-bedroom has the added bonus of being a top-floor corner unit with “amazing light” from eastern and northern exposures and “views to the Bronx and Westchester,” said Armen Meschian of Exit Realty.<br /><br />Prior owners updated the galley kitchen, and though the bathroom is original to the apartment, it’s been kept in “good shape.” The entire building has new windows, and there is no wait list for a $165-per-month parking space in the building’s garage.<br /><br />When a deal for the unit fell through, the seller and brokers reassessed the market, &quot;saw an uptick and movement,&quot; and increased the price by $13,000, Meschian said.<br /><br />Location: The Donner Gardens Co-op, developed in the early 1950s, is on the border of the Jackson Heights Historic District. Unit 6D overlooks The Towers, the famous 1924 garden-apartment complex where Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock and other Hollywood royalty once lived.<br /><br />Plenty of ethnic shops and restaurants are nearby, including the new “Arepa Lady” store at 77th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. At 78th Street is the Jackson Heights Green Market. The 7 train is 3.5 blocks away at Roosevelt and 82nd; the QM22 express bus is at 82nd and 31st Avenue.<br /><br />Why put it on your open house calendar? Prices for apartments in Jackson Heights are only going up and sales are happening quickly. “Last weekend, we listed and sold two apartments, including a one-bedroom for $318,000,&quot; Meschian said.
