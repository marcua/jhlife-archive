If the choice is something that &quot;always&quot; works or nothing and complaining about it on a board that I sincerely doubt is a hub for Jackson Height&#039;s teens, I think talking to teenagers is more likely to lead the outcomes parents and caregivers of small children want, don&#039;t you?<br /><br />Teenagers aren&#039;t monsters. Many of them have younger siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews. What teenagers often are though is caught up in their own fun and goofing around and not thinking through the consequences of their actions. That&#039;s kind of a hallmark of being a teenager. Talking to them, and getting a bit stern if necessary, is unlikely to be a negative.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for all the input everybody!&nbsp; I went over and talked to them.&nbsp; Most of them were a bit upset, but they were able to enjoy their running and tag on the big kids&#039; side of the playground.&nbsp; I guess a part of me was afraid they would respond with a distinct disregard for authority.&nbsp; It must the tv portrayal of teenagers!

					Does anyone notice the increasing number of male teenagers hanging out on the playground in Travers Park in the late afternoon? My concern is that these young men are running around and chasing each other where our babies and toddlers are also walking slowly and learning to walk.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes, these teenagers are seen jumping over fences, opening doors, and failing to close the metal gates after they exit.&nbsp; It is dangerous to have open doors, since it will allow our kids to run out.&nbsp; The fast running also means that kids are pushed around by their frantic running.&nbsp; Any opinions on this?

					Before we start reengineering our traffic flow to reduce the number of illegal U-turns and K-turns people love to make, and the double parking, why don&#039;t we start just enforcing the law? Cops should be handing out tickets routinely to the U-turners and the people who double-park on 37th between 75th and the BQE (there should be a cop who just tickets double parkers on that stretch full-time - it is totally out of control).

					Would it kill them to have the Q33 continue to stop at LaGuardia as well as the Q70? And is one bus every 12 minutes during rush hour going to even remotely meet the demand? Bear in mind we are talking about the major airport, serving the global megacity with 468 subway stations, that has no rail service whatsoever. (Yeah, that one!)

					It&#039;s a nice place. Very quiet and suburban-feeling area. Totally different than JH but not in a bad way. The commute would be a bit of a pain since you&#039;d have to take a (long) bus ride to the E train (there might be an express bus during the week as well).<br /><br />The Queens County Farm Museum is right across the street, and it&#039;s a real operating farm. Very cool and rustic but be aware that you might experience some, shall we say, unusual aromas for an urban environment, if the wind is just so!

					When the decisions are being made by people like Bloomberg who get on a helicopter or private jet when they want to be in nature, this is what we get. Would it ever occur to Bloomberg or this oil sheik that when most of us wake up on a Saturday morning after a loud, jarring, fluorescent-lit week surrounded by screeching steel and concrete, there isn&#039;t a Gulfstream fueled up and ready to take us off to Martha&#039;s Vineyard for the afternoon? This was understood on a gut level even by the famously elitist Robert Moses - his visions for urban parkland, flawed as they were, showed some kind of compassion for the spiritual needs of regular working human beings, and are a great legacy for this city. <br /><br />Today we have no such luck. Our city is run by people who only think about money generated per square foot, and as long as that&#039;s maximized, the city is being run &quot;successfully.&quot; It must be nice to contemplate how successfully the city is being run when you are relaxing on your Hamptons estate on a cool summer evening. Of course the sweating masses wouldn&#039;t appreciate the subtlety of this sublime, relaxing place. They want their competitive sports and loud &quot;active&quot; enjoyment, so let&#039;s make sure they get it (especially if we make money in the process). If you want to sit on a bench, read a book, fly a kite, have a picnic, toss a Frisbee? Sorry, the corporate overlords say no. We&#039;ll take your tax money, thank you very much, now please get lost.<br /><br />I am reminded of the very-much-in-vogue architectural drawings we see everywhere. The people are fuzzy, faceless computer-generated avatars whose only function is to provide an aesthetic accent on some plutocrat&#039;s dystopian architectural nightmare. This is exactly the way Bloomberg and Sheik Mansour see regular people like you and me - indistinct, computer-generated, part of the background, devoid of humanity.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nypost.com/r/nypost/2013/02/25/sports/web_photos/photo-9162517--525x350.JPG" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nypost.com/r/nypost/2013/02/25/sports/web_photos/photo-9162517--525x350.JPG</a><br />

					shawsome, good point - honking is never enforced by the NYPD because they can never prove it. I read that the new NYC taxicabs will have lights on the roof that will automatically turn on when the driver presses the horn - so that cops can see more clearly and unambiguously who is honking. This should of course be required on all private vehicles in NYC as well, not just cabs.<br />

					I&#039;m amazed that something like this is even on the table. As others have said this would never happen in Central Park, Prospect Park, or any park surrounded by people with social capital to burn. People who live near Flushing Meadows Corona Park - one of the city&#039;s most beautiful, under-appreciated parks - don&#039;t have the money or time to mobilize the way the Upper West Side moms did when Robert Moses tried to turn a Central Park playground into a parking lot back in the 60&#039;s. As a result, Bloomberg and his cronies figure they can just steamroll over any opposition. For wealthy Manhattanites, no harm done; for them, Flushing Meadows Park is a place to come to once a year for tennis, and the rest of the year, it might as well not exist.<br /><br />Speaking of tennis, even the presence of the existing Tennis Center in the park is utterly egregious. Western Queens has just about zero parkland other than Flushing Meadows, so to restrict even a square inch to two-weeks-a-year paid admission is ridiculous.<br /><br />And don&#039;t even get me started on a mall. As if the existing malls in Flushing and Rego Park aren&#039;t enough.<br /><br />Memo to Bloomberg: NYC is not a corporation. Maximizing profits per square foot is not the appropriate function of a public servant.<br />
