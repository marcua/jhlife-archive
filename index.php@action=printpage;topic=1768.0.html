				I&#039;m looking for a place to buy quality hay, not too expensive, in a decent-sized bag (but not too big, because then it makes a mess and my apartment isn&#039;t that big that I have a place to store it).&nbsp; I have a car, and have been driving to the pet store on Northern Blvd, next to National liquidators.&nbsp; I&#039;m not crazy about it, sometimes they&#039;re out of hay, and I&#039;m paying $5 for a small bag that doesn&#039;t even last a whole week!&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried petstores on Steinway Street in Astoria, and that was even worse!&nbsp; $5 for a tiny bag that only lasts a few days.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; If the bunny walker is reading this, please give your suggestions on where to buy hay!

				No, I haven&#039;t tried Petland, but I did wander into a pet store on Roosevelt in the 70s and found it to be dirty.. I would be afraid that there would be bugs in there.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to check out Petland to see if it&#039;s better and has what I&#039;m looking for.<br /><br />I have 2 rabbits, and hay is supposed to be a staple in a rabbit&#039;s diet.&nbsp; You&#039;re only supposed to feed them 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of pellets per day and also fresh greens.&nbsp; I give them lots of hay and also put it in their litterbox.<br /><br />

				Hi we just lost our rabbit.&nbsp; We have a bag of hay it is opened but filled to top, some pellets and a huge cage with wheels we also have the litter box and water bottle. I don&#039;t think we are getting a new pet&nbsp; this has been a heartbreaking year we just lost our dog of 15 yrs last month and now oreo. If you&#039;d like all this please let me know I&#039;d rather give it away then throw it away it also has a bed area on top. She has been to the vet I think her age and problems with digestion/teeth is to blame but I will clean&nbsp; the cage supplies with bleach anyhow.

				I&#039;m really sorry to hear about your rabbit and your dog.<br /><br />I volunteer for a group, Long Island Rabbit Rescue, that fosters and adopts out abandoned bunnies.&nbsp; I adopted my own from there, and they are just precious...&nbsp; You may want to consider adopting another bunny.&nbsp; LIRR will give you the background on each bunny, and you can meet them all to decide which is a good fit for you and your family.&nbsp; All rabbits are spayed/neutered before being adopted out and litterbox trained.&nbsp; They also provide education to new rabbit owners.&nbsp; I was just at one of the shelters this past weekend and it was hard to drag myself away because there are so many sweet bunnies there craving attention.&nbsp; Website below, including pictures of adoptable bunnies (unfortunately-there are new ones each day as well):<br />http://www.longislandrabbitrescue.org/index.htm<br /><br />If you have definitely decided you do not want another pet, I can take the items off your hands and donate to the group.&nbsp; I hope you will consider adoption, though, as there are so many wonderful bunnies in need of a good home, and so few good homes for them.

				Purchase it online at Bunnybale!&nbsp; It&#039;s the ONLY thing I use for my lionhead rabbits.&nbsp; It is better quality than anything you can get at a pet store and your bunnies will seriously love it.&nbsp; It is greener and it doesn&#039;t shatter as easily.&nbsp; It is supposedly healthier for your buns as well since it is so fresh (it&#039;s straight from a farm!)&nbsp; It is ultimately also cheaper than getting int he store because it comes in bulk.&nbsp; If you have indoor only rabbits, go with the Timothy Hay variety - it has less calories for your bun.&nbsp; If your bunny is very very active or an outdoor rabbit, then use the Alfalfa variety.&nbsp; http://www.bunnybale.com/<br /><br />If you totally run out of hay and can&#039;t get bunnybale in time or you just don&#039;t like bunnybale for some reason, then I&#039;d go with the Oxbow brand...but it&#039;s quality still isn&#039;t as good as Bunnybale and it will ultimately cost you more in the long run.<br /><br />I have also used Kaytee brand in the past, but it is largely less desirable...the quality just isn&#039;t there...and it shatters everywhere (meaning it breaks into a million pieces and your buns tend not to eat those as much - that means you are wasting money).
