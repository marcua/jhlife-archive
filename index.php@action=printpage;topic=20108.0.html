				Yes we are really lucky that most stores and services are open here. Except Farine :P<br /><br />In Manhattan a lot of stores are still closed or are sort of open but not really open, like they have lights on but no staff and a &quot;Back in 5 minutes&quot; sign up for hours.

				It&#039;s been interesting to see that most of our stores and restaurants are hanging in for now--not nearly as many empty storefronts as I see in Manhattan. I hope that can continue--and worry about what will happen to the restaurants in the winter. We are ordering from them a lot, and eating outside sometimes--I hope they can find a way to hang on when outdoor dining has to shut down for the winter. It would be so sad to see things start to fold at that point. Right now the streets are so lively with the outdoor tables and often music--a nice, hopeful contrast to the sadness I feel in Manhattan driving past places I&#039;ve been patronizing for years that now have &quot;For Rent&quot; signs in the windows.

I think the nearest one is in East Meadow if you want a preview. Low prices, few staff members, many products bearing their own label, limited number of non-food items. Packaged cheeses are very low price. Like the other two chains they&#039;ve had some food items recalled recently.

				<br />Lidl is a German-owned, Europe wide chain that I used when I was living in the UK. It has a very successful marketing strategy which amounts to &quot;pile em high sell em cheap&quot; as its UK rival Tesco used to say. Almost everything sold is its own brand and they had very good results with that. They often won blind tastings certainly on wine but also on cheese as well as other things. The store is no-frills, many of the goods are in boxes. They had suppliers from all over Europe so that they could have a Greek month or Spanish or Italian where they would offer goods from those countries on special offer. The last time I was in the UK I found their prices were unexpectedly lower than their American equivalents particularly for things like smoked salmon or specialty cheeses, booze almost an across the board better price. They have become a major player in the UK supermarket scene and really in Europe as well. If you go to a Lisbon Lidl or Prague or anywhere they have a reassuring sameness. <br /><br />If they are opening in Astoria I would certainly give them a try. I suppose it goes without saying that I was firmly in the Lidl camp.The only caveat is how much they might have changed to adapt to the American market. If they continue the products they had sold in Europe at the same price here they will be one of the few success stories of our depressed and suffering city.

				Aldi and Trader Joe&#039;s are subsidiaries of two different German chains, Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud.&nbsp; Aldi was owned by two brothers and one no longer wanted to sell cigarettes in the stores so they split into two companies. Trader Joe&#039;s is owned by Aldi Nord and Aldi&#039;s by Aldi Sud.&nbsp; They have similar business models and often work together, at least in Europe, but they are separate companies.

				Having been to the UK Lidl and the Rego Park Aldi there are clear similarities. They both use their own brand for much of what they sold and competed on discounting that undercut their traditional rivals. They sold goods out of boxes rather than shelves and had very few staff. This would give rise to long Trader Joe type lines without any of the efficiencies Trader Joe has to keep the line moving&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />However, the edge goes to Lidl who I think had a much more interesting array of goods although that was probably because they were sourcing from Europe where they are based. Whether they can maintain that as a US operation is open to question however I was a fan of theirs and look forward to the opening of the Astoria Lidl in the coming weeks.

				<br />DeBlasio is relying on the community groups for advice to expand on his vision of the new normal. As far as restaurants go, you guys down in the 70s have a Thai group working in that capacity.<br /><br />The community groups are being elevated to an empowerment that seems to bypass Community Boards.
