				My 30yr old boiler has died and was wondering if anyone on the site knows who does this kind of work at a reasonable price. I called Blyn union gas after the boiler was making a loud buzzing sound.&nbsp; Their rep came and&nbsp; told me I needed a new boiler and the cost would be approx. 7,500. bucks.&nbsp; I still have to get an estimate from them so this was just a ball park figure he threw out.&nbsp; Has anyone had to replace their boiler recently?&nbsp; &nbsp;Any info would be appreciated bc I know little or nothing about it.&nbsp;

				Same thing happened to mine last year, depending on the size it&#039;s going to be in the range you were quoted.&nbsp; though its always helpful to get other prices.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if I would reccomened who I used.&nbsp; The work is great but communication is really tricky, unless you know Polish.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Other things to note:<br />- The installer will typically match the new boiler BTU with the old one.&nbsp; But if you wanted to check how much BTU you really need this site has a great excel sheet to help size the boiler based on your existing radiators - http://www.crownboiler.com/Support/Education/Boiler-Sizing<br />- Use http://www.supplyhouse.com/ for looking for boiler specs (if you&#039;re so inclined).&nbsp; I ended up using Weil-McClain, good efficency and reviews<br />- National Grid (or your gas supplier) usually has sizable rebates if you get a boiler about set % efficiency, check their website
