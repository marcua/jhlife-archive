				I find it very disturbing that in the past week we have 3 threads going here on this subject.<br />First it was the swastikas, then the Indian community, and now holiday decorations. Is there something in the air over JH lately?<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe the swastikas were necessarily anti Semitic.<br />I do believe the initial comments about the Indian community were prejudiced.<br />I don&#039;t think anyone is out to disrespect Native Americans.<br /><br />I have already stated on the swastikas thread that reason and level heads are needed.<br />Emotional responses leading to mob mentalities are just as bad if not worse than the initial acts.<br /><br />It is already acknowledged here on this site that we live not only in the most cosmopolitan of cities, but also in the most ethnically diverse of zip codes. Our own JH is a unique gem for many more reasons besides being a historical district. Before celebrating our cultural diversities we should firstly be celebrating our unity.<br /><br />I think a few people here might want to consider taking a xanex and then let&#039;s sit down and share what we all cook at home. It&#039;s all good stuff!

				Yes the tolerant now appear quite intolerant.&nbsp; My husband who happens to be South Indian was totally outraged with the recent thread by Mike V where he expressed his narrow minded, prejudice views toward the Indian community.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s obvious the only Indian Mike V has ever known is a samosa!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Why is that comment by Mike V still up?&nbsp; It is clearly and blatantly racist and bigoted.&nbsp; It really should not be up.&nbsp; I have notified the moderator and I think others should, too.
