				Aren&#039;t all of these split into 2 or 4 units?&nbsp; Is this price for the whole thing, or just one unit?&nbsp; Always wondered just how these homes worked.&nbsp; Does one person own the whole thing and rent out the other units?&nbsp; Or, are they each owned separately?&nbsp; Anyone know?

				they&#039;re single family. my ex and i looked at a smaller one, either that block or 87th, back in 1996.asking price was 375,000. the buyer got it, all cash.<br /><br />we ended up buying one of the spanish houses on 75th for quite a bit less. we split in 2003, and she sold it a couple of years ago for $999, 900 - to avoid that one million dollar balloon tax. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16601.msg79678.html#msg79678">Quote from: hum@njukebox1 on June 24, 2017, 08:07:11 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In any case, I shan&#039;t be moving into any $1.675 million dollar homes any time soon.&nbsp; Or, in this lifetime for that matter.&nbsp; Sigh.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				the floor plan is included in that listing, and it&#039;s a 5 bedroom, three bathroom single family. It&#039;s a big house. Not sure what the basements are like in those homes and if they can be converted to usable space. If a powder room can be added to the first floor, that would be ideal for a large family. I&#039;ve seen close family members jointly buy a single family house, and this looks like a home that would work well for that.
