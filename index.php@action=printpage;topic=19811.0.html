				Security for the Mayor or airlifting patients over Elmhurst hospital. They take a very long time for the latter.&nbsp; And they&#039;re back for the third time this hour.<br /><br />If I knew it was for patients I&#039;d learn to live with it.

				It&#039;s just hovering over different parts of the neighborhood. I think it&#039;s a NYPD patrol/deterrent against possible nightlife (of which there isn&#039;t any) or commercial burglaries in the area.

				Hi I heard for the first time last night. I&#039;m neat St. Joan of Ark as well and it sounded like it hovering right above my building. Rather scary when it wakes one up at 2AM.<br />Whatever the reason I would like to know why this is happening during these hours.<br />

				Someone on Citizen app said it was NYPD helicopter and they were looking for suspects around 82nd Street; ground patrol was checking rooftops, fire escapes, etc. <br /><br />Woke me up from a sound sleep around 2am and once I got back to bed after 4am, I had wretched dreams that had me tossing and turning.

				Wrote to Danny Dromm (and also said nice things -- I am a fan of his) and got this reply from his office, for what it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; Will try to contact every other local elected official later.&nbsp; I encourage everyone else to do the same!<br /><br />Thank you for contacting us (and thanks for your kind words, which I have forwarded to Council Member Dromm.)&nbsp; I am sorry that you and your family are being kept up at all hours of the night/morning. The CM also hears the pervasive helicopter noise. At this time, we do not know who is flying the helicopters or what their purpose might be.&nbsp; He is reaching out to the 115th Precinct and the Mayor&#039;s office to inquire.&nbsp; We will keep you updated.

				I was listening to scanner and heard a report of a missing 15 year old.<br /><br />If they have some type of infrared vision assistance I could see the lack of spotlight, but if there&#039;s on the ground officers also canvassing it seems like the spotlight would have been warranted to aide them.<br /><br />It does seem weird that there&#039;s no spotlight in use. Would be nice to hear what Dromm gets from the 115.

				they are going to Elmhurst hospital, as my window looks down 80th Street and I can see one hovering over the hospital last night.&nbsp; There are multiple&nbsp; copters so the ones over 35th Avenue are queueing to go to the hospital.&nbsp; Also a few nights back at around four am there were airplanes flying over, I assume this is the military coming in.

				that&#039;s a very plausible explanation.<br /><br />does anyone know if the private helipads arrayed around Manhattan are still operational? i really don&#039;t know anyone at the private helicopter trip pay grade, but it would seem like they&#039;d be grounded as non-essential....
