				Hello! The good weather is coming and our poor, park-deprived neighborhood needs help. We are applying for the Play Street again this year, to run every Sunday from June 1st to October 31st. <br /><br />There is something different happening this year; an initiative spearheaded by our new City Councilman Danny Dromm and his staff. We are applying to keep the Play Street going for the entire months of July and August, Mondays to Sundays! We need some help though.<br /><br />Primarily, we need our petition signed by you. The more signatures we get in favor of this, the greater the likelihood of it actually happening.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not sure what the Play Street is, here&#039;s a brief explanation:<br /><br />For the past two years, a coalition of neighborhood groups aided by many volunteers have closed 78th Street between 34th and Northern to traffic on every Sunday during the Summer. This relieves some of the congestion in Travers Park and opens up the street for all sorts of activities. More information can be found on www.jhgreen.org &nbsp;(http://www.jhgreen.org)<br /><br />You can find our petition in Espresso 77 (77th, just north of 37th) - if you&#039;re in the mood for a coffee please sign it there, and in Table Wine (37th between 79th and 80th) if you&#039;re hankering for some great wines and interesting liquors. <br /><br />It would be even better if you were to print the petition yourselves, sign it, get your friends and neighbors to sign it and hand it in to either of those places.<br /><br />The petition can be found here: http://www.jhgreen.org/docs/Summer-Playstreet-signature-page-(2010).pdf &nbsp;(http://www.jhgreen.org/docs/Summer-Playstreet-signature-page-(2010).pdf)<br /><br />Thanks very much, let me know if you have any questions!<br /><br />Dudley

				While it is unfortunate that Travers Park will not be able to be fully utilized this summer, a full closure of 78th Street is not a solution, thereby creating an asphalt extension.<br /><br />It is unfair to the community to close an entire street for months at a time.&nbsp; <br /><br />-- I would like to know how the surrounding residents feel about this proposal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Garden School operates year round<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The apartment building on the street will be impacted, as well as those on 77th Street as a result of traffic diversion.<br /><br />-- My greatest concern is that 78th Street is a through-street for the FDNY, and NYPD.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-- Response times will be affected by the proposal.<br /><br /><br />While I do support the Play Street, I believe that such a drastic closure cause too negative of an impact on the area.<br /><br />A scaled back proposal would be best for the community.<br /><br />

It&#039;s a one-block-long stretch of a street, it&#039;s really not going to have a negative impact on the neighborhood, and it is particularly helpful in our neighborhood due to how little park space we have. Travers Park becomes dangerously crowded in the warm weather, it&#039;s not good for the kids or the adults who want to use it. The Play Street helps alleviate this. And it&#039;s not just for the kids, many retired/elderly people have taken advantage of it and will do so more if we close it permanently for those months and are able to set it up properly for the entire community to use.<br /><br />Dudley<br />

				So true Dudley, the park is so dangerous now! The side that remains open is supposed to be for younger children but with no where to go it is filled with babies to 8 year old children. Also, the elderly people and the others that used the areas to exercise are also affected, there is no where for them to go!!

				(http://danieldromm.com/images/banner4.jpg)<br />Dear Friends &amp; Neighbors,<br />&nbsp;<br />I wanted to share with you the latest news about Travers Park and the 78th Street Play Street.<br /><br />Throughout my campaign last year, among the most frequent concerns expressed by the community was the severe lack of open space in our area. <br />I believe that all New Yorkers should have access to quality parks and adequate recreational opportunities. <br />Our City Council district has the least amount of access to greenspace and park land of any in the city. I am committed to addressing this challenge as a top priority.<br /><br />Over the past few months, I have received a number of emails and phone calls from residents about the construction at Travers Park. <br />Many people contacted my office to inquire about when the work would be completed and also about the safety and security of the construction site. <br />With these concerns in mind, I spoke personally with Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe and asked for special consideration to accelerate the construction at Travers Park.<br />&nbsp;<br />Although the contract didn&#039;t require that the work be completed until October, I am happy to report that my work with Commissioner Benepe <br />and Queens Parks Commissioner Dorothy Lewandowski has enabled us to have the large playground area open much sooner. <br /><strong>In fact, the large playground area is open as of today. </strong><br />The staging area for construction will continue to be closed off for approximately six more weeks to allow for smaller fixes to the park including resurfacing.<br /><br />Travers Park is an excellent playground but is not sufficient in size or layout to service our community.&nbsp; <br />We have benefited over the last two years from the 78th Street Play Street which provided additional open space for residents to enjoy on Sundays. <br />This successful initiative was organized by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, Friends of Travers Park and the Jackson Heights Green Alliance. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>These groups have approached me with an innovative and cost-free way to temporarily expand open space for our community -- <br />having the 78th Street Play Street (between Northern Blvd and 34th Avenue) car-free everyday for the summer months of July and August this year. <br />&nbsp;I believe this is an excellent grass-roots program which I am committed to supporting.<br /><br />Here is how you can help: Community Board 3 will vote on Thursday, May 20th to either support or not support the July/August car-free experiment on 78th Street. <br />We need every voice to come out and let the Community Board know your opinion on whether to expand the Play Street operation to July and August everyday.</strong><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong><br />78th Street Play Street Hearing<br />Community Board 3<br />Thursday, May 20th 7:30pm<br />IS 227 Louis Armstrong School<br />32-02 Junction Blvd (between Northern and 32nd Avenue)</strong></span><br />&nbsp;<br />Please join me in working toward a solution to the vital challenge of inadequate open space in our community. <br />Working together we can bring the changes we need.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel Dromm<br />New York City Council Member, 25th District<br />&nbsp;<br />May 8th, 2010

				Walked by Travers Park (Playground) today and looked like the park is now all open. &nbsp;I didn&#039;t notice any significant renovation or improvements. Looked like a new tennis net on the blacktop. Curious if someone knows what was done for all the money spent to renovate our only park. &nbsp;Also, as I walked around the perimeter (the fence still looks shabby) and thought wouldn&#039;t it be nice if there were some benches to sit away from the hectic, noisy playground area. &nbsp;Benches are sorely missing in the neighborhood. &nbsp;Hope to see continued improvements in public space for all to enjoy in Jackson Heights. &nbsp;

				Hi! Just a quick reminder that we will be marching from Travers Park to the Community Board meeting in the Louis Armstrong school (32-02 Junction Boulevard). The purpose is to show support for the Play Street for this year.<br /><br />We&#039;re applying to have it run for the entire months of July and August and we&#039;re hoping that a lot of community support will help convince the community board members of how important the Play Street is.<br /><br />So we&#039;ll be meeting at Travers Park (the corner of 78th and 34th) at 7PM, please come if you can, or go straight to the meeting at 7:45.<br /><br />Also, whether you&#039;re coming or not please email the community board at: communityboard3@nyc.rr.com and Council Member Danny Dromm at: dromm@council.nyc.gov and let them know that you support this initiative.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Dudley

				<strong>TODAY!</strong> members of Community Board #3 will have an opportunity to give residents of Jackson Heights two months of play street this summer! We have the least amount of open space per capita in all of New York City and the play street really helps alleviate this problem.<br /><br />We need you to march with us <strong>TODAY</strong> at 7 p.m. from Travers Park to I.S. 227 to call on all community board members to vote for two months of more open space for our neighbors. I will be there and so should you!<br /><br />For the past two years, the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, Friends of Travers Park, and Jackson Heights Green Alliance have organized an initiative to close 78th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard so that our children and families may enjoy their Sundays outdoors and close to home in a car-free, community environment. <br /><br />Travers Park, our only park, is too often too overcrowded. Continuing this experiment will allow us to spill over to the street adjacent to Travers Park so that more of our children can exercise and play.<br /><br />PLEASE COME, OUR CHILDREN NEED US!<br />

				Tonight was an amazing scene.&nbsp; Over 200 people showed up to march from Travers Park to the Louis Armstrong School -- enough to stop traffic and require a police escort.&nbsp; The meeting featured a strong introduction from the Green Alliance, enthusiastic endorsements by our entire delegation of elected officials, supporting statements by the Garden School, FDNY, NYPD, and DOT, and pleas for more park space from many community residents -- both adults and children (including my 1st grader!).&nbsp; I had to leave at 9pm, but before then I heard only one person speak against the proposal.<br /><br />The end result: CB3 overrode the recommendations of its Transportation Committee, and voted to support the Play Street!&nbsp; As reported by Len Maniace on Facebook: &quot;Community Board 3 approves the Pedestrian Plaza Playstreet proposal closing 78th Street every day in July and August. The unofficial vote was 28-yes 9-no, with 2 abstentions.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />This is huge.&nbsp; Three cheers for Friends of Travers Park/JHBG, the Jackson Heights Green Alliance, and Councilmember Dromm&#039;s staff for all of their hard work on this.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m hoping that this is the first step in permanently covering over 78th Street with green and making it a true extension of the park. I&#039;d like it to extend to Northern Blvd. as well.&nbsp; What an improvement that would be over beeping, radio blarring, polluting cars. What Jackson Heights would benefit from is a municipal lot. I drive but in this case &quot;park&quot; wins over cars---hands down.

				The first step is to make sure that the 2 month period this Summer goes really well. I think it&#039;s important to establish that this is something for the entire community. Families, elderly people, young people, everybody should be able to enjoy the car free temporary plaza at Travers Park. <br /><br />We need help making this happen. <br /><br />We need people to: <br /><br />help supervise the street. <br />help organize events on it. <br />help raise money for it. <br />coordinate volunteers. <br />get supplies donated from stores and corporations. <br />help me lug a thousand square feet of astroturf from New Jersey. <br />fill planters with soil and plants.<br />find a big outdoors storage bin for cheap or for free.<br />update the website.<br /><br />...and more, much more!<br /><br />If interested, please send an email to info@jhgreen.org - or post on here! I&#039;ll probably make a proper request as soon as I have the time to work out exactly what we need.

				I think having a park is much more important than parking, and I drive and don&#039;t have kids. I think people have to remember that the closing of this street is part of a bigger movement to create more park space. Travers Park is really a playground...not a park. Despite its renovations, it remains small and over utilized. It would be great to have benches and trees and grass, but as a first step, I applaud it!

				Thanks for the comment about kids and unstructured vs. structured activities. That speaks volumes. I agree that kids today, having not been able to play unsupervised, don&#039;t necessarily know how to play outdoors. I&#039;m a city kid -- grew up in Queens on a block with cars and a city bus. Despite that, we played jump rope, rode our bikes, played punch ball, skelly, hopscotch, stoop ball, jacks, clapping games, and more. On occasion, a carnival ride on a truck or the bookmobile came to my neighborhood, but we were pretty much left to our own devices to create our fun. I hope that the playstreet will give JH kids the same opportunity. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have kids but I love them, so don&#039;t take my comments the wrong way. I guess it&#039;s tough for me to relate to supervised play, play dates and the like when I grew up with the ability to run free. So with that said, if anyone is interested in jumping double dutch in the playstreet after work, I&#039;m game. <br /><br />Why should the kids have all the fun?

				I think it&#039;s important to remember a few things when you see that street and the park sitting empty-- <br /><br />1) It&#039;s been REALLY hot outside<br /><br />2) This is an all volunteer initiative, with city agencies granting permission but doing none of the work, donating a sum total of 7 large planters (but not the soil or the plants), doing none of the cleaning, plant watering, programming or anything else. In other words, this is a true neighborhood initiative. I&#039;d say if you don&#039;t think there is enough happening there, then it&#039;s up to you to change it. And you can. <br /><br />3) The street is closed 24/7 so that it can serve as an overflow when the street is most crowded -- afternoons when the weather is nice, weekends, etc. In a perfect world we would just close it then, but it&#039;s a logistical nightmare to close it -- clear out the cars, put up the barricades, etc. It&#039;s much easier to just keep it closed 24/7. <br /><br />4) Sure, there are times when the park is empty and the closed street seems superfluous, but the street is actually much more shaded, and thus cooler. Also it allows some space for younger kids to bike and play without getting hit by baseballs, soccer balls, etc. And when the park is crowded, which it often is, this will hopefully provide a lot of overflow space. <br /><br />5) So far I&#039;ve already seen a lot of activity on the street in the cooler evening hours including elderly residents just enjoying some air, families hanging out, games of catch, kids learning to ride bikes, skateboarding, etc. But the street has been closed for less than a week. Give it time to become part of peoples&#039; routines. <br /><br />As for the &quot;small patch of astroturf&quot; well, there was more than twice that amount but someone stole all but what you see now. So, blame them.<br /><br />Finally, I&#039;m not trying to be confrontational, but maybe it&#039;s inevitable. I have to admit, I really don&#039;t understand why there is any opposition to this project. This neighborhood has a TON of parking. It just also happens to have a TON of drivers. So, yes, parking is at a premium. And all those car owners know well and good that it&#039;s a tough neighborhood to park in and yet they chose to buy a car (and yes, I said &quot;chose&quot; -- if you need a car even though you have such great transit options then you&#039;ve made a choice to live in a dense neighborhood and own a car). And yet we are supposed to feel sorry for these drivers because 50 or so parking spaces got lost for 2 months?<br /><br />But really, would anyone argue there is TOO MUCH recreation space in Jackson Heights? I don&#039;t understand why parking is the holy grail. I really don&#039;t. Do car owners have some divine right to unlimited free parking spaces that I didn&#039;t know about?&nbsp;

				Interesting when someone says they don&#039;t want to be confrontational, then they go on to attack people for having cars in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I guess the same can be said that if one chooses to have kids and moves into a neighborhood with limited park/playground space, they deserve what they get.&nbsp; I am not against initiatives like the play street and the dog park.&nbsp; I think they definitely add to the neighborhood. It does seem most projects are for special interests of people with kids or dogs.&nbsp; There also is a shortage of space to sit for everyone else without kids or dogs.&nbsp; Some simple benches placed around the Travers playground perimeter would be nice so one can sit without being hit by a ball or listening to screaming kids.&nbsp; Peace.

				I don&#039;t see why the cars versus kids is such an issue either.&nbsp; The street closes off what, maybe 20 spaces tops, yes?<br /><br />On any given day, I&#039;m sure more than 20 kids utilize the play street ...<br /><br />Maybe the problem is kids aren&#039;t voters ...<br /><br />Now, if you all want to petition that neighborhood needs a parking lot, feel free to organize a march, etc like the playstreet did.

				My wife and I and our two children went to the playstreet this afternoon and it was packed. We met friends there and our children played both in the playstreet and in the playground. There were countless children drawing with chalk, riding those plastic cars down that plastic ramp, skateboarding up and down the street, and walking with their parents.&nbsp; There was also a lot of people sitting on lawn chairs talking, drinking and eating things bought at the farmer&#039;s market, and enjoying the day.<br /><br />I felt I should just mention this given the talk on this thread about the playstreet supposedly not being used or how it was taking parking spaces away from the community. <br />

				I totally agree with you Pipman.<br /><br />We have Flushing Meadow Park with lots of miles of green space where kids and pets can run wild. Heck, children and adults alike can get a pretty nice workout just by, dare I say it?, WALKING to the park. If too many cars is an issue then work on making public transportation better than what is is now. I don&#039;t drive to work, I take public transportation, and it SUCKS during rush hour (9-6pm). If you care for lots of trees and cooler summer days where parents and children...blah, blah blah, then STOP having too many children! Read about the carbon foot print overpopulation has on this planet and then you can finally work on REAL solutions not just for the little block you call home but for mother earth as a whole. But no, people would rather have one block car-free even if in the process they make traffic -and air quality- worse when cars are detoured. But hey...it&#039;s all about the kids and families.

It does seem most projects are for special interests of people with kids or dogs.&nbsp; There also is a shortage of space to sit for everyone else without kids or dogs.&nbsp; Some simple benches placed around the Travers playground perimeter would be nice so one can sit without being hit by a ball or listening to screaming kids.&nbsp; Peace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I&#039;m a little confused by your statements username.<br /><br />You support better public transportation.<br />That means you recognize that public transportation reduces traffic, and emissions, etc. from less people driving.<br /><br />You support a cleaner environment.<br />And champion places like Flushing Meadows, because they offer places to play. <br />(Albeit suggesting a 2 mile walk there is feasbile for young children, especially after playing on the way home).<br /><br />You support walking as a form of exercise.<br /><br />But are concerned the about the lack of parking one street causes?<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I think would be an ideal project for you based on that ... <br /><br />It obviously makes sense that since children can&#039;t walk as far or fast as adults, the park needs to be closer to the communities, but I like that you advocate those 2 miles walks.&nbsp; By your thinking, improving the air quality of the whole neighborhood would be to build a parking lot 2 miles away that EVERYONE who drives&nbsp; a car could walk to.&nbsp; If you have kids, you can drive by the neighborhood on one designated block to pick them up after you get your car.&nbsp; Oh wait that makes no sense ... yes Iw as being sarcastic, forgive me ... <br /><br />Hmmm ... better to stick with the plan in place.&nbsp; A little room to play for the kids, at best 20 cars affected.&nbsp; Seems fair.<br /><br />

				Some people need cars to get to work everyday. For example, I used to work in Melville, LI. The closest LIRR station was either Farmingdale or Huntington. My friend&#039;s husband worked in Connecticut in a location that was not close to a Metro North station. In both situations we could take the train but we would have had the extra expense of a cab every day. <br /><br />I grew up in a part of Queens that has driveways and garages, and no alternate side of the street parking. I&#039;m still not used to on-the-street parking. And, after shoveling out a couple of times, I decided to leave my car at my bf&#039;s house in Westchester this past winter, but it&#039;s back now and I&#039;m happy to have the option of driving or using the MTA. Who can say they really enjoy waiting for the train on a 100+ degree subway platform?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				This thread has a lot of things going on, but I&#039;m responding to the issue of parking.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think people realize just how much total space is used to provide free parking (i.e. free large object storage).&nbsp; This blog post has a nice analysis of parking space in downtown Montgomery Co., Maryland (a suburb of DC):<br /><br />http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post.cgi?id=6642 (http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post.cgi?id=6642)<br /><br />20-50% of the total land area is used for parking in the Central Business District and some shopping areas!<br /><br />The numbers may not be that high in Jackson Heights, but it is still a lot of land devoted to free large object storage rather than other, potentially more productive uses.&nbsp; It is mind-boggling that people object to a mere block being appropriated for play space for a matter of weeks (it&#039;s not even permanent!).<br /><br />And I am not a car hater...I have a car because a) I need it to carry large amounts of equipment to work sites throughout the city (mostly areas of Queens and Bronx that are hard to access on public transportation), and b) like the freedom of being able to go outside the city on a random Saturday, take my kid to see relatives in the suburbs without much planning, etc.&nbsp; However, I pay for a private parking space and don&#039;t expect the city to provide free storage.

				Incidentally, two cars actually were on the playstreet today ... luckily there were not towed (at least as 12 noon, and one had left by then -- the bold driver slowly weaving through children :( )

				Streets Blog is asking people to vote for the &quot;Best Liveable Streets Moment of 2010&quot; I think the march to the CB3 meeting to secure the play street for the summer is one of them.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link to the voting:<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/12/22/cast-your-vote-for-the-2010-streetsies/ (http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/12/22/cast-your-vote-for-the-2010-streetsies/)<br /><br /><br />It only takes a second ! <br />
