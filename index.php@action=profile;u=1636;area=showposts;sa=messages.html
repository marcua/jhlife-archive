					There&#039;s a Twilight Zone episode where a man and woman, I think strangers, board a late night train to go home to their loved ones.<br /><br />After some polite conversation they discover to their bewilderment they&#8217;ve been going around in circles--seeing the same scenes over and over.<br /><br />Well, I won&#039;t bore you with the ending. You could catch it on the Syfy Channel if you haven&#039;t seen it already.<br /><br />Like the strangers from the twilight zone we&#039;ve been going around in circles.&nbsp; You have offered nothing of substance to convince me, and perhaps others who are undecided or looking to have their opinion swayed that a vote for Danny is the better choice.<br /><br />And I failed to lure you into a serious debate.&nbsp; Maybe it would have been easier and less threatening had I written a few generic questions from the start.<br /><br />The sad truth is I could probably make a better pitch for Danny Dromm than you could.<br /><br />I may have my disagreements with his political leanings, associates, and tactics.&nbsp; And I do.&nbsp; I won&#039;t diminish his past accomplishments for the gay community in Queens.&nbsp; I admire that he and a few others put themselves on the front lines for gay rights, and demanded an end to gay violence in Queens during the 1990&#8217;s.<br /><br />You may or may not been around when Julio Rivera was brutally murdered in 1990 and the Police failed to carry out a proper investigation.&nbsp; Danny, along with others, led the charge for justice.<br /><br />As a founding member of the long defunct Pink Panthers, I know it was an uphill battle for legitimacy.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2008. The issues have changed since 1990.&nbsp; For the most part, it&#039;s no longer a life or death decision or a fight for equal treatment in most areas, at least in NY.&nbsp; Some battles remain; those will be won too.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s be honest with ourselves, the fact that we haven&#8217;t won the right to marry or openly serve in the military doesn&#8217;t prevent us from succeeding in life.&nbsp; (Yes, I proudly served in the military too and I&#8217;m not a Republican).<br /><br />Our past accomplishments--securing rights and respect--have allowed us to look outside of our own community and make political decisions that affect the larger community.&nbsp; There are larger issues that affect our community, our city and our own personal interests.<br /><br />For me, voting for a candidate solely because he is gay or has a strong record on gay rights is no longer enough to win my vote.&nbsp; Mayor David Dinkins has made promises to the gay community and to large degree he failed to deliver.&nbsp; And now we have a President who&#8217;s made promises and shows signs of reneging on them.&nbsp; (Yes, someone got a shiny medal as a consolation prize). <br /><br />I am not convinced that Danny Dromm is ready or prepared to make the leap from an activist to a community leader who could honestly and fairly represent our diverse community.&nbsp; I knew him in the past, and from what I see and hear now, he hasn&#8217;t changed.<br /><br />Apart from &quot;who is the real Danny&quot;, his performance at the debates bares this out--perhaps this could be another topic.<br /><br />Our engagement these past few days has done little to convince me otherwise. In fact, I see in your responses the same divisive, snide dismissal and belittling of opposing opinions, and the squashing of legitimate debate that Danny has used to advance his own activist/political career.&nbsp; Do I want these qualities in a community leader.&nbsp; No!<br /><br />You could have the last word.<br />

					Elections are about competing ideas.&nbsp; Perhaps your neighbors and you will have an opportunity to cast that ballot.<br /><br /><em><strong>Throughout our conversation, you and Aronan have not offered me or the readers a reason to vote for Danny Dromm.&nbsp; All youâ€™ve done was belittle my opinion, accuse â€˜therealdrommâ€ and me as being one and the same, and worst of all, called me a Republican</strong></em>.&nbsp; (I thought the Democratic Party had a larger tent).&nbsp; <br /><br />This is one gay-minority Democrat who refuses to jump into the Danny Drumm conga line, and click his heels to the Progressive, yes we can change mantra.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since you have Dannyâ€™s ear, please ask him to articulate the changes he wants to bring about.&nbsp; He certainly didnâ€™t do it during the debate last Thursday.<br />

					Sure, itâ€™s easier to create a conspiracy than to form a counter-argument.&nbsp; Too bad itâ€™s unoriginal and unentertaining.&nbsp; Try again. <br /><br />I donâ€™t know who therealdromm is, but Iâ€™d love to take him out for a steak dinner.&nbsp; If you find out who he is, please do pass on the invitation.<br /><br />Youâ€™re obviously an operative.&nbsp; Please carry this back to HQ:<br /><br />There are gay-minority men in Jackson Height who think Danny Dromm should continue teaching and confine himself to activism.&nbsp; He would be disaster for Jackson Heights, and all the other communities that seem to be forgotten in this race.&nbsp; This community could ill-afford a gay version of Al Sharpton.<br /><br />Drommâ€™s performance at the South-Asian debate on Thursday showed how simplistic he really is, and pandering to a minority audience will win him little votes.&nbsp; It was a good move that he brought his posse with him; otherwise the room would have been deaf silent after his responses. <br /><br />

					liam0925, did I touch a nerve? The topic is &quot;The Real Danny&quot;.&nbsp; I know he has many personas, but the one I described is the one that I know.&nbsp; Amazing how easy it was to stitch &quot;Danny&quot;, &quot;Chicago style politics&quot;, and &quot;eclipsed&quot; in a &quot;short paragraph&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />How many episodes of <em>SNL</em> did you watch before&nbsp; coming across &quot;verklempt&quot;?<br /><br />Did you watch the <em>Untouchables </em> before writing your post?&nbsp; It&#039;s a real leap to imply that I was equating Ness and Capone with Danny.&nbsp; I do not, and I certainly was not implying such.&nbsp; Chicago style politics stretches that far back in history; however, my reference was more Daley, the father.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I wrote a few paragraphs on the subject, and if you want to judge it as an essay and belittle it, you have the 1st amendment behind you.&nbsp; This is an open forum to exchange ideas and challenge opinions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Forum rules are specificâ€”private names should not be mentioned.&nbsp; Danny is a public figure and he is fair game.&nbsp; I think we both could agree that our arguments should be respectful.<br /><br />As for the Pride Parade and the â€œcommercialâ€ festival, held on the first Sunday in June, the powers on the pride committee, which Danny was apart of, several years ago, made an attempt to move the festivities from Jackson Heights to Austin Street to follow the money and to <em>clean up its image</em> (that&#039;s a euphemism I used)...that move was stopped by the membership.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be back, and with an essay.<br /><br />Enjoy the holiday.<br /><br /><br /><br />

					I have no doubt that if Danny Dromm were elected, his victory would usher in Chicago style politics to Jackson Heights. Our community could ill-afford that development.&nbsp; Danny&#039;s long life devotion to activism has been more about self-promotion and opportunism than gay and minority rights.&nbsp; Ask a few of his past associates who were unceremoniously tossed under the bus out of fear they may have eclipsed Danny.&nbsp; The man is devise and polarizing.&nbsp; The last thing this community needs is a person who will encourage identity politics.&nbsp; (Yes, I&#039;m Latino and gay---so please no more progressive help and change).&nbsp; <br /><br />As a sidebar, I know for a fact that Danny Dromm tried to move the parade and festival to Austin Street many years ago where the pockets were deeper and lighter in color.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />
