				I am reaching out to my neighbors hoping someone here knows something about this:<br /><br />I bought sliced mango at Fruitadona, presumably cut and packaged at the store. It looked overripe but I needed to add to my purchase in order to use a credit card. When I bit into it, I experienced a tingling sensation. I&#039;ve had this happen to me before when eating sliced fruits; melons, I recall, and maybe strawberries too. I had been told years ago that a preservative added to the fruit causes this sensation. I tried googling it, but came up with just food allergy, which it is not. Does anybody <em>know</em> what the heck I am eating? Maybe someone who&#039;s been in the food/restaurant business? There are no ingredients listed on the container. <br /><br />Is it possibly not an additive but just what happens to tropical fruits as they get old?<br /><br />Should I throw it out? (In the past I have always thrown it away.)<br /><br />It&#039;s happened to me enough times that I really want to know.

				A few theories:<br /><br />If the fruit was overripe, they may be starting to ferment and that could cause a tingling sensation.<br /><br />Sliced fruit is sometimes dusted with ascorbic acid to prevent browning. That&#039;s probably the preservative you were thinking of. The reaction of acid and water can cause fizzing. My guess is that you got a double-whammy with sliced fermenting fruit.<br /><br />Allergies are also possible, depending on what you mean by tingling. I&#039;m mildly allergic to mangoes, melons, papaya, and kiwi--- I can still eat them, but they make my mouth and throat feel itchy and numb.

				Mango skin is related to poison ivy. http://web.extension.illinois.edu/cfiv/homeowners/120726.html<br /><br />If the mango still has little specks of skin on it, as in not 100% peeled, and you have this allergy, you will get the tingling and swelling sensation.<br /><br />http://web.extension.illinois.edu/cfiv/homeowners/120726.html<br /><br />Edited to add: I just re-read your post and see that you stated it&#039;s not a food allergy. Why are you so sure that it&#039;s not? I have absolutely no food allergies besides this one particular one to mango skin and pineapple.<br /><br />

I got no itch, burn, numbness, swelling from the mango, just a tingle--more aptly described as a fizzle, the term mewmewlia used--where the fruit touched my tongue. I&#039;ve experienced it only when the fruit is pre-cut and packaged, but not every time. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m sensitive to the ascorbic acid powder, or maybe they used too much?<br /><br />There is no skin on the mango that I am referencing here, but thanks for that interesting tidbit, Shelby.<br /><br />Hasn&#039;t anyone else on this board experienced this?

				found this...<br />http://ask.metafilter.com/150150/Why-do-these-berries-taste-tingly<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering that if a store is adding AA to its cut fruit, even tho it&#039;s a safe additive, shouldn&#039;t customers be made aware?

I have found that Fruitadona has fruit, flowers and milk that are fast approaching the end of their shelf lives.&nbsp; I buy my mango from the fruit cart on the corner. Some of the best I ever had.
