			The point of the first link was to illustrate that Trader Joe&#039;s does nothing to better the world, unless they are forced to. An illustrated example would be the Imokalee Workers who fought for years to get TJ to pay a penny more per pound on tomatoes to lift the wages of the pickers. Again, only because of immense pressure, not because they are a &quot;good&quot; company did they finally cave.<br /><br />Trader Joe workers are nnot compensated well for their hard work. Trader Joe&#039;s has spent billions of dollars promoting itself as a good employeer, but just like Fox News&#039; attempt at a similar PR, most of us have the ability to see through the campaign. <br /><br />Reason TJ has low prices? same as why Wal-Mart has low prices. They pressure the supliers to agree to artificialy low prices. <br /><br />I for one, will not stand by while people beg a multi-trillion dollar company to do business in my neighborhood. <br /><br />And remember K2000, if the &quot;big boys&quot;, Trader Joe&#039;s, Wal-Mart, Wholefoods, et.al. can get away with being terrible employeers, neighbors, and citizens, then the little guys will as well.&nbsp;

			We had a thread some time ago about the unfair treatment of grocery workers in Queens. http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=3862.0<br /><br />I like Trader Joe&#039;s and will continue to shop there once a month or once every two months or so -- whenever it&#039;s convenient for me to get there.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t support a store here in Jackson Heights because of the horrible traffic congestion it would cause.&nbsp; The existing Queens Trader Joe&#039;s parking lot and surrounding streets get extremely congested, especially on weekends.&nbsp; We already have enough of that.

			I really wouldn&#039;t mind a Trader Joe&#039;s anywhere in Western Queens.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as if I&#039;d shop there all the time anyhow.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a large store and really only specializes in certain things.&nbsp; You don&#039;t buy a lot there - they don&#039;t even have big shopping carts.&nbsp; I would still shop locally too if we had one.&nbsp; I&#039;d do both.&nbsp; That&#039;s the beauty of having options.&nbsp; You buys some things here, some things there.&nbsp; &nbsp;But as far as affordable organic options, let&#039;s face it - it&#039;s not as if this area has many of them.&nbsp; Most of the grocery stores here have one tiny ass section devoted to organic and they mark it up in price.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather buy the organic at the greenmarket on Sunday - which I do - than buy organic at the local grocery store.

			Hope this isn&#039;t too off topic... does anyone know anything about Food Cellar? It&#039;s an Amish Market store. I go to the one in LIC and absolutely love it. They won&#039;t open in JH, they stay in the monied areas, but I was wondering if anyone has any info on the good-corporate-citizen aspect. <br />Jeanette
