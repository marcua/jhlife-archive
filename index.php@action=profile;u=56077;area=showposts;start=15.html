I hope DoT adds a Citibike station there, and then as they expand in to Jackson Heights in 2022 (which I think is the current plan) we can get more in the actual zip code. <br /><br />When I see all the places I could get to with a Citibike that I frequent in Woodside, Sunnyside, and Astoria that have Citibike stations near them, it makes me all the more excited for an expansion in to Jackson Heights.

I understand the concern about parking, I drive. While I can stomach a small reduction in parking spaces, and even a slow gradual reduction of more parking spaces, I also strongly believe that must be accompanied by overall improvement in public transit that makes it easier for more people to decide they don&#039;t actually need a car (or a second car),

While I am for local parking permits, I would also be for city wide permits for contractors and teachers. At least right now I think I would. My mind could be changed. Something I notice is that in the mornings, locals who need their cars for work leave before 8 am and there&#039;s a lot more flex in the street parking available. And we want teachers and contractors that have to use cars to get to work early to be able to park without getting tickets. Ideally I&#039;d like mass transit to be improved enough that a teacher living in the Bronx could commute using mass transit to Jackson Heights and spend a max of 45 minutes door to door. Until that happens, I think we should be thinking of teacher&#039;s parking needs as legit needs for the members of our community that teach our children.

I don&#039;t know what plan you are looking at, but it&#039;s not the plan DoT presented to CB3. The plan DoT presented would eliminate parking on one side of 34th Avenue at the proposed plaza blocks (Travers and the blocks directly in front of schools along 34th Avenue) and the chicanes I guess would eliminate at least one spot, but that&#039;s far from at least half the current parking spots.<br /><br />It&#039;s one thing to criticize the plan or express dissatisfaction with it for removing parking spots - we all have our own prioirities - but it&#039;s an entirely different thing to misrepresent the plan. So what plan are you looking at that suggests to you the removal of *at least 50% of the parking* along 34th Avenue between 69th St. and Junction?

					Considering how much activity the anti-OSers engaged in within coops along 34th Avenue - posting flyers in lobbies, door drops, going door-to-door, etc. - you&#039;d think they&#039;d have generated more protest votes for the libertarian (or rather, the Democrat who ran as a Libertarian) who actively promoted his position of ending 34 Ave OS.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m not a single issue voter, and I&#039;m not giving a vote to an obvious loser just because I&#039;m not a fan of 34th Ave being closed for 12 hours a day.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not talking about you personally.

It just doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense to me. I hope DoT comes back with something else.

					DOT said they wanted to reduce the reliance on volunteers to move the barricades twice a day. Then proposed diverters that drivers could simply drive around to easily access 34th Avenue for several blocks, making the Open Street not very pedestrian friendly, which DOT also said would probably mean the barricades would have to stay. Come again? <br /><br />The barricades were an imperfect temporary solution fine for an emergency. We need design choices that limit cars to local traffic only, that keeps the space safe and inviting to pedestrians, and allows local drivers incapable of moving a heavy barricade access to the street to park, drop off/pick up, etc. This isn&#039;t it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">like those losing their garage or business accesses along the avenue.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />FYI, nobody is losing garage or business access.

					Maybe you guys should start participating in community forums? In their presentation to the community board, DoT highlighted the consistently high foot traffic of 34 OS, the great job their partner running the program (Coalition) is doing with programming, and that DoT employees have taken over clean up, maintenance, and some of the barricade duties.

					^what&#039;s illegal about the current set up of most vendors? And do you really want vendors on every block?<br /><br />The only real issue that has been raised is that beyond having a vending license, which they may have, they aren&#039;t supposed to set up in the median (but what harm does it actually cause since the road way is shut down to traffic during the hours they are vending) and the opponents of OS logged enough complaints about their neighbor in the 90s who was setting up essentially a flea market every day on the median to have that come to an end.

					I&#039;m not aware of any place to throw them out locally. If they are still full, College Point might be your only option. If there&#039;s space, you can put cheap clay cat litter in them and leave the top off to dry out. Once it&#039;s all dried out you can throw them out regularly.

					Wow, that&#039;s something! The city has been moving towards more bike lanes since Bloomberg, and it&#039;s finally starting to happen in Queens, and this coop essentially bans bikes. What&#039;s the rules on electric scooters? Not exactly a forward thinking board of directors.

					^the planters replace the extra barricades DoT had set out on the corners with fire hydrants. Because of where the hydrants are on those blocks there isn&#039;t a legal parking space between the hydrant and the crosswalk (though people park there), so the planters serve to beautify and deter cars from entering the block.<br /><br />I think the HORT funding runs through December for now, so HORT employees can clean on out planters. We&#039;ll have to see what happens after that - with both the DoT proposal for 34 OS and funding for employees. I haven&#039;t seen any collecting trash, and I think they&#039;ve been out for about six weeks now.

					How do you find out about becoming a vendor at these flea markets? I assume you rent a space and table, but Mr. Google hasn&#039;t been very helpful.
