			I, like so many of you, are saddened that this JH Life forum will come to an end soon.<br />This website has been a hub of opinions, questions, suggestions, and recommendations for as long as I can remember. A very special bond has been created between users and I would hate for that to be lost. So...<br /><br />I am working on a new forum - Jackson Heights IRL (in real life) at:<br /><br />www.jacksonheightsirl.com<br /><br />I will include all the same topics and features of this wonderful site and maybe add a few more. Please share with others so the community of Jackson Heights can continue to care and support each other online and in real life.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing you over there to continue sharing news and building a strong community - Jackson Heights In Real Life.<br /><br />Cheers and Happy Holidays!<br />

			&nbsp;WOW. Thanks for this and it looks terrific! The graphics and topics are engaging and I love that you kept some of the familiar areas and added others. Nice! Look forward to keeping connected to the community for some time to come. I think the word for this is a mitzvah? except that am not religious, jewish or otherwise, but love the concept.

			good luck with it. I&#039;ve never understood the &quot;don&#039;t call a troll a troll&quot; rule though. <br /><br />I also think the advice provided on this forum, though sometimes overlooked by the admins, of recognizing that tone is often hard to read in text only exchanges and your own bias may have to more to do with interpretation of tone than anything the person actually wrote.
