					I&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights for most of my life enjoying its wonderful tree lined streets, its unique and beautfully designed buildings and surrounding gardens.&nbsp; Our apartment buildings&nbsp; are humane in size (only six stories) so that we as people are not dwarfed by the gargantuan monstrosities that ruin neighborhoods.&nbsp; We can enjoy the sky and each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;As part of the safest city in the world, Jackson Heights is one of its best neighborhoods.&nbsp; It&#039;s safe, prosperous and friendly with good schools and businesses catering to every need.&nbsp; Transportation to everywhere by&nbsp; planes, trains and buses are a block or two away.&nbsp; It has the best of everything and it&#039;s affordable!!!!!!

					Bellabella<br /><br />The little grey puppy found his owner. &nbsp;I walked him about 2 hours ago and a woman came racing down the street screaming that&#039;s my puppy!!!<br /><br />She lives two doors down from my building. &nbsp;I asked her why there was no notice or fliers and how did her puppy get out. &nbsp;She said he slipped out of the house and she didn&#039;t notice him missing until after 11:00 pm last night. &nbsp;She didn&#039;t thank me or shake my hand but the puppy was happy to see her. &nbsp;In the process of combing the neighborhood for signs, I lost my very expensive glasses!!!! &nbsp;Oh well, who said no good deed goes unpunished.<br /><br />Bella if anything turned out right in all of this it was your kindness and the puppy&#039;s happiness. &nbsp;Thank you for your support and concern.

					I called the vet on Northern Blvd between 89th and 90th Street.&nbsp; He did not return my call.&nbsp; I went all around the neighborhood this morning with my puppy and our foundling but there were no signs for a lost puppy and no one seemed to know this cute little guy.&nbsp; It&#039;s so odd.<br /><br />He cried the whole night.&nbsp; I fed him and walked him and played with him but he cried and wailed the whole night.&nbsp; He misses his family.&nbsp; My Ruffian tries to play with him and, of course gets ansy, when I pet and pay attention to the newcomer.&nbsp; But the two puppies are not aggressive toward each other except for an occasional &quot;me first&quot; for a treat or a neck rub.&nbsp; They are both sleeping comfortably at the moment and my apartment is quiet.<br /><br />Tomorrow I will try to contact the vet on 89th, International Veterinary, because one of the tags lists that name on a Rabies vaccine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If this were my puppy, I&#039;d be putting up fliers and combing the street.&nbsp; The silence from the owners is deafening and very disturbing.&nbsp; I&#039;m going out again to see if there are any fliers anywhere and I will check with Noah&#039;s Ark.&nbsp; Working for an accounting firm during tax season (12 hour days sometimes 7 days a week the closer we get to April 15th) makes doing anything else almost impossible until after the deadline.&nbsp; Maybe the owners will come forward ... unless they just threw him away.&nbsp; &nbsp;People cannot be that heartless ... or could they!!!!?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Thank you dearest bellabella and camh.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep you posted.&nbsp; <br /><br />

					PBS President earned $632,233, NPR former President Kevin Klose $1.2 million, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting CEO Patricia de Stacy Harrison earned $298,884, plus $70,630 in additional compensation.&nbsp; <strong>The president of PBS earns more than the president of the United States!!!!!<br /></strong><br /><br />No one is suggesting PBS and NPR cease to exist.&nbsp; We want these media outlets&nbsp; to cease draining the coffers of the US Treasury and emptying the pockets of the already beleaguered US taxpayer.&nbsp; They tout themselves to be the best in news, entertainment, investigative reporting, the most sought after thinkers and doers, the most liberal and progressive news outlets and opinions, the best of the best in everything.&nbsp; Bravisimo!!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />PBS and NPR can now take their very expensive best off the public dole and make it on their own in the free markets.&nbsp; We wish them well.&nbsp; We&#039;ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars paying their salaries, hiring pundits and talk show hosts whose opinions and commentary no one else cares about except the ever edgy leftwing.&nbsp; In return for our money, PBS and NPR spew their hatred for we the people by calling the taxpayers who fund these ungrateful louts racist, ignorant and hateful.&nbsp; Charlie Rose cuddles up with the likes of Awaleed, the creepy Saudi prince who tried to give New Yorkers 10 million dollars to forgive and forget 9/ll, the Muslim Brotherhood from whom they thought they&#039;d get 5 million dollars and fringe groups like La Raza who spew anti American everything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Parting is such sweet sorrow but it is nonetheless very sweet.&nbsp; The cultural overpaid elite of PBS and NPR won&#039;t have to come up with the pejoratives for the Tea Party bigots and the majority of American racists and we the taxpayers won&#039;t have to pay these worthless wonders their salaries anymore.&nbsp; Everbody wins except for the American masochists, those self loathing citizens who enjoy being castigated, criticized and worked over for even being alive.

					I found this feisty little puppy on 89th Street between 34th and 35th Avenue.&nbsp; It has numerous tags one of which claims it has a microchip but when I entered the number on the tag, the database responded there was no such number.<br /><br />This puppy was loved and cared for.&nbsp; If you see a sign somewhere about a little lost puppy, please let me know and thank you for being helpful.&nbsp; I am determined to find its owner who must be very sad tonight.&nbsp; My puppy is good natured and sweet and we will try to make our little orphan as comfortable as we can until we find the owners of this delightful ball of fur.<br /><br />Thank you for your kind response.

					I went to St Mary&#039;s Help of Christians grammar school in Woodside, the oldest Catholic church in Queens.&nbsp; We were taught by the Dominican sisters from Amityville.&nbsp; The school became a parking lot even though the parishioners came&nbsp; up with a viable plan to save the school.&nbsp; Holy mother church in all of its infinite wisdom saw fit to sell the church and the school to a garage ... the faithfl be damned.<br /><br />The sisters were kind and dedicated to all of us.&nbsp; Their lives were all about us ... their students.&nbsp; The church was small and country like.&nbsp; There was virtue in its plainess.&nbsp; We were a working class parish with all of the hopes and promise of the American dream.&nbsp; We received a solid eduation and none of us would dare embarrass our parents or even ourselves with bahavior that was either reprehensible or unseemingly.&nbsp; We weren&#039;t angels but we tried to do our best.&nbsp; We respected those whose achievements were greater than ours and we respected those who tried their best even if they were not at the top of the class.<br /><br />I miss the good sisters of Amityville ... especially Sister Vincent Marie.&nbsp; She was a remarkable teacher whose knowledge of world history and her demands of excellence from all of us changed my life.&nbsp; I miss that little country church with its marvelous choir.&nbsp; We learned the mass in Latin. We grew up in this rich atmosphere ... were taught to love the Church, our country and our family.&nbsp; As took pride in our work and sought to make ourselves good and decent adults. <br /><br />Holy Mother Church paid off its crushing debt to those victims of molestation by selling its very valuable property which housed those needed churches and schools.&nbsp; In its infinite wisdom the Church exonerated the sinful clergy by shielding them from the law opening the church to lawsuits from which it could not insure themselves so they sold church property to pay the lawsuits they lost.&nbsp; The clergy paid nothing.&nbsp; The innocent faithful lost their parishes and their schools.&nbsp; God may forgive the clergy but I won&#039;t.&nbsp;

These ads are to get the rest of America to watch the US Open on TV, using backgrounds that mid-America already knows are NYC. Note that they&#039;re not just using today&#039;s tennis players, but images of past &#039;stars&#039; who no longer play. They&#039;re using recognizable Tennis and NYC &quot;Stars&quot; to try to get you to watch a TV program. <br /><br />While a Unisphere or some of the towers (Hey, hon - wasn&#039;t that in Men In Black) image could have worked, I&#039;m not sure how many other Queens landmarks could serve as shorthand for an outsider&#039;s impression of NYC. <br /><br />What other Queens landmarks do you think would be recognized on sight by the rest of the country? (I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some...I just can&#039;t think of any right now)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I thought the ad was kinda jazzy, glitzy and inspiring.&nbsp; For Queens&#039; inspiring images we have the 59th Street Bridge, the Mets Stadium, the Flushing Park Zoo, the statuary around the borough municipal building, the Rockaways, the subway, the historic landmark of the Towers and Gardens, Louie Armstrong&#039;s house (not too striking but with some added content like Louie&#039;s face and music ... a very nice colage), Queens College, the waterfront overlooking the East River and our trees ... we are the borough of Linden trees.&nbsp; Also we have a nice zoo ... not a big zoo or a spectacular zoo like in Manhattan and the Bronx but a very nice place for American wildlife.

					Queens is the borough in search of an identity only because we are surrounded by the super borough of Manhattan and the former city of Brooklyn ... Queens never even had its own team.&nbsp; We eventually had the Mets ... not the Queens Mets ... just the Mets.<br /><br />Brooklyn was a City, Manhattan is the city, the Bronx (no thonks) and Staten Island was only an Island.&nbsp; Queens is the prettiest of the boroughs ... quiet, prosperous, good schools, hard working people and lotsa of small businesses.&nbsp; It also seems to be the safest and the quietest with the most trees and gardens except of course for the Botannical Gardens om Manhattan that always has everythng.<br /><br />But as was pointed out people say ...&nbsp; &quot;I&#039;m from Brooklyn or New York or the Bronx.&nbsp; No one says &quot;I&#039;m from Queens.&quot;&nbsp; We &#039;re from Jackson Heights or Forest Hills or Woodside or the Gardens.&nbsp; I came to Queens (Woodside) as an infant and returned after my divorce to raise my son here.&nbsp; I was glad to come home.

					I took my pupster to the Humane Society right over the 59th Street bridge (took a livery for $20) and they only charged me $50.&nbsp; They were fabulous ... very caring and so reasonable.&nbsp; There is also a pet mobile that is very reasonable for transport or, if your pupster is small take him by public transport.<br /><br />Also you can call the ASPCA that has a&nbsp; Mobile unit that parks itself, when it comes to Jackson Heights, on the corner of 89th Street and 34th Avenue.&nbsp; They spay for free or for whatever you can afford to pay.&nbsp; Find out their schedule and make an appointment.<br /><br />Vets should spay for less than cost because it is in the public interest to neuter our animals.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck.
