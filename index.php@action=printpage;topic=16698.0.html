				so, my co-op board mailed out our financials, along with a new offering amendment - standard stuff, nothing to see.<br /><br />except:<br /><br />for the first time, the board/management chose to individually list the remaining sponsor apartments, which are rented, and the precise rent of each, rather than simply lump them together as &quot;rental income.&quot; there are only a few (there were about 15 or 18 when i purchased a sponsor apartment back in 2002) and all the tenants have been here for a really long time (and all pay a rent that&#039;s reasonably close to the maintenance the units would bring in).<br /><br />i feel strange knowing the precise rent these longtime tenants - many of whom i am friendly with - and i wonder, does anyone else feel it&#039;s intrusive to give that intimate a look at the financials of individuals? i mean, does it actually matter that person A is contributing $1240 of the $7000 per month? isn&#039;t the total/bottom line the only thing that actually matters?

				Is it the rent the tenants are paying to the sponsor or the maintenance the sponsor is paying to the building that is listed? The only thing the board would be concerned with is the maintenance being paid by the sponsor. <br /><br />Or perhaps, there is a new law requiring the actual rents or sponsor apartments to be listed now...?

				we used to have one line saying (paraphrasing here) &quot;rental unit income per month,&quot; with the sum total listed.<br />now, the individual units are listed one by one, with rent received in one column and potential maintenance fees in another - there&#039;s the tiniest difference among them, three with rental income being less, one with rental income being slightly more.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t really understand this. I thought that the sponsor would have to pay whatever the maintenance fee for the unit is, so the rent they are getting from the tenant should be unrelated.

				poor wording on my part, not intentionally misleading.<br /><br />each unit is broken out as follows:<br /><br />Unit Number - Rent - Maintenance - Surplus/(Deficit)<br /><br />as i said, the Rent - Maintenance - Surplus/(Deficit) has been part of the package shareholders receive since i&#039;ve been here. but this is the first year that the individual units have been listed one by one. <br />

				i&#039;ve read the financials carefully every year since i moved in. the health of the corporation does concern me. i just never felt the need to know the amount of the rent check written by the senior citizen who sometimes looks in on my apartment when i am away.

I assume all the shareholders know how much each unit pays in monthly maintenance. That is comparable to knowing what the rental units&#039; rents are.<br /><br />Also, I think the discussion about whether the sponsor pays the regular maintenance, and not a fee that is dependent on the rent received from the tenants, is relevant. If sponsor is paying maintenance, then there would be no deficit or surplus to report. The sponsor himself or herself may have a surplus or a deficit but it shouldn&#039;t affect the coop&#039;s financials. At least that&#039;s my understanding about how coops should work.

				the sponsor, who is no longer represented on the board, having fallen under the 10 percent threshold of held shares designated in the by-laws as guaranteeing a spot, pays maintenance. i have no idea why the management company - and the three management companies prior to this one - presents the financials as it does. with one exception, our management companies have largely been responsive to discussion with board members only. <br />

Can you imagine the lawsuit when the renters start getting looks and comments from the co-op owners about how they are not paying their &quot;fair share&quot;?<br /><br />This info is private business information of the Sponsors and not pertinent to the financials of the co-op.

				My two cents.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing &quot;personal&quot; about the rent that a stabilized or rent controlled tenant pays;&nbsp; You can find out that information by simply asking HPD and they will provide you with the entire rent history for each regulated and controlled apartment going back several years.<br /><br />The Co-op may be doing this to pressure the sponsor to sell apartments where their rental income exceeds the amount of maintenance - such as where a stabilized tenant moves out (or passes away) and the sponsor proceeds to rent to a market-rate tenant instead of selling the apartment and installing a resident tenant-shareholder.&nbsp; Nothing illegal about a co-op applying such pressure to sell since the sponsor does not live in the apartment, as co-ops do it all the time with varying degrees of success.

				The shareholders own the building through the coop corporation. I believe, as owners, they are entitled to any information regarding the flow of money in and out of the corporation. That&#039;s why the monthly reports (it may be quarterly in your coop), if done right, should contain detailed information on the inflow and outflow of cash. It would seem that information on the rent paid can be released to the shareholders.

				we&#039;ve always received the info about revenue from rent stabilized units - as a whole. just not individual tenants. we get info about revenue from laundry machines, and that info isn&#039;t broken out washer by washer, dryer by dryer. we don&#039;t get broken out info about exactly who pays rent for storage spaces or bike spaces. i was simply wondering why it&#039;s suddenly become a priority to know what the tenant in 9-x pays, versus the tenant in 11-y.
