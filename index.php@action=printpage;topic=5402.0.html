				<strong>What was the last restaurant you patronized and what did you eat. &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t matter if you had a dirty water dog from the corner or a Porterhouse...it&#039;s about the experience and your honest opinion. &nbsp;Good or bad, fancy or a hole in the wall...pictures are welcome and if it is in Jackson Hts and immediate area even better. &nbsp;<br />I&#039;ll start if I may...Uncle Peters...we started with Manchego Cheese &amp; the Jamon Serrano as well as the grilled Calamari with a super delicious sauce. The Calamari was a hit! :smitten: For the main we had the grilled pork chops and the Entrana steak, all served with veggies. The pork chops were thick and served with a generous amount of gravy but a bit on the saltier side. &nbsp;I think they could have done with less sauce or none at all, in all fairness I think the cook may have slipped with the salt in the gravy. &nbsp; The entrana was big enough for two so it made for a slamming breakfast sandwhich &nbsp; :D . I&#039;m a Sangria snob so I ordered a small jar, served a glass to the wife and added a glass of Merlot to the jar...Delish! The sangria is fine...just a bit sweet for my personal taste. &nbsp;I didn&#039;t think about it so I didn&#039;t take pictures but I will next time I go.</strong>

				So far this week:<br /><br />Cafe Bar in Astoria - the seared tuna salad.&nbsp; Pretty good but a bit salty.&nbsp; Think I would prefer to try something else next time.<br /><br />Tomo - salmon avocado rolls &amp; a seaweed salad.&nbsp; It did the trick.

				I just got lunch from the new Five Guys that opened up near my office. Their burgers are great - reminds me of In-n-Out in CA.&nbsp; I wonder if a place that just served burgers (good ones) would make it in JH.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sort of embarrassed to admit that I don&#039;t eat out much in JH. I am only home for dinner and prefer to cook something light as I eat my main meal at lunch. I love Indian food but I find our neighborhood places to be way too salty for me (that&#039;s probably just me - I even pick salt off of pretzels).&nbsp; The last thing I got in the hood was momo from Shangri-La.&nbsp; <br /><br />I noticed a new momo cart where the old one used to be (by the hardware store catty-corner from Sammy&#039;s halal truck.&nbsp; Has anyone tried it?&nbsp; &nbsp;I love momo and keep forgetting to give it a try.

				QUAINT (http://quaintnyc.com/), over in Sunnyside. Split two appetizers, mussels and calamari between the 3 of us. I had salmon fillet and pesto linguine, Kate and Steve TOTALLY copied each other and had the tilapia, baby bok choy and fingerling potatoes.

				Just came back from the Northfork on Long Island where we had lunch at The Modern Snack Bar.&nbsp; We started off with perfectly fried fried clam strips for an appetizer.&nbsp; For our main course we had deep fried soft shell crabs served with a side of pureed yellow turnips and french fried potatoes....the crabs were perfectly cooked, light and crunchy.&nbsp; We also had the roasted turkey served with a savory dressing, green beans and a homemade cranberry sauce.&nbsp; For dessert we shared an amazing homemade lemon meringue pie!&nbsp; <br />I can see why this diner has been around for sixty years!!!&nbsp; A perfect meal from quality of food, reasonable price and excellent service.

				we ate at the new &quot;moes&quot; in the rego park mall. I had a bean burrito with a side&nbsp; Of rice and free chips with free salsa. The burrito was humongous -I couldn&#039;t eat the rice. THe chips felt like they were missing something.&nbsp; THere was a small salsa bar with about 6 or so salsas I tried 4. One had too much chili powder (it tasted like bad chili). The corn salsa had too much jalepenos and the other salsas tasted like they dumped a bottle of lime juice in there. I liked that the chips were free and drinks refillable and salsa but they need to tweak the chips/salsa. My daughter had the soft chicken taco kids meal and loved it. I would go back although I am not a fan of fast food.

				<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">Went to Pasta Del Giornio last night in Austin / Forest Hills. One of those places that is in a great location and can have really great food &amp; also very mediocre dishes. I&#039;m not a big fan of their pasta (ironic) but then again, while I love northern Italian I&#039;m not a pasta lover. &nbsp;I also know when and when NOT to take the waiter&#039;s recommendation. We started with a delicious bottle of Bodega Norton Malbec Reserva, stuffed zucchini and Caesar salad. My guy Oscar didn&#039;t offer :tickedoff: any of his zucchini but he wolfed it down and said it was delicious. &nbsp;Oscar had the bronzino grilled which I&#039;ve had there before. They claim it&#039;s imported from Argentina but I always though it was only available from Europe. &nbsp;I had the gigantic Angus medium...(I didn&#039;t have lunch &amp; I was hungry &nbsp;:( ). The staff has always been attentive but they can get busy and then the service will lack. &nbsp;I admit I never had their risotto and I only have the same main courses. &nbsp;I do experiment with their appetizers a bit but I like the salads best.</span> &nbsp;<div align="center"> <br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/IMAG1524.jpg?t=1287283146)(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/IMAG1522.jpg?t=1287282783)<br /><br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/IMAG1528.jpg?t=1287282879)<br /><br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/IMAG1527.jpg?t=1287283048)</div>

				<em><strong>OH YES,&nbsp; I ALMOST FORGOT.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to a new place (New for me) in east Harlem for a late lunch.&nbsp; Ricardo&#039;s steak house...2145 2ND Avenue by 110Th street.&nbsp; Dark, exposed brick, Open kitchen in the front, nice eclectic decor with interesting lighting.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t expecting much so when I opened the menu and saw so many Italian dishes and steak specialties along with American and Latin dishes I was surprised.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really enjoyed the variety of music as well.&nbsp; I heard some old school hip hop, some British pop and some salsa from the 80&#039;s...I was home... :D.<br /><br />When the waiter came he asked if I wanted something to drink and I wasn&#039;t sure if I should have alcohol on a sunday so early.&nbsp; Well, he recommended a Lychee white sangria...Wow, nice and very generous.&nbsp; The garlic toast was really tasty and I decided to skip the main course and order their appetizers sampler platter which was basically 4 different appetizers.&nbsp; It had the clams casino (made with what looked like Canadian bacon), crabcake (It had a light corn like coating with a sweet, almost mango or banana aftertaste), 2 Angus beef empanadas and...and -&nbsp; (I can&#039;t remember the 4Th item...thanks LYCHEE SANGRIA&nbsp; - oh wait, grilled calamary&nbsp; :rockon: )&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t take a picture of the food but I do have a link to their web site.&nbsp; I want to check out the place on an evening...my cuz is coming from Ohio on Thursday so I think we&#039;ll hit the spot to try out some of their seafood (and some Lychee sangria)&nbsp; :D :D.</strong></em><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">http://www.ricardosteakhouse.com/index.php</span>

				<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">@ Madalyn ..I read all of the posts and I found them interesting ...this is my personal view...again...not meant to evoke the fury or anger of anyone and this is simply my point of view because I want to keep the thread / subject friendly, fun and informative about the food and restaurants that we patronize. <br /><br />We can live off meat only or plants only and excluding either one of those will not manifest into a healthier longer life, regardless of the claims of vegetarians.&nbsp; Yes, if organic perishables were available at more moderate pricing I would assume more people would reach out to that option.&nbsp; I know plenty of vegetarians and also those that wont touch anything green on a plate.&nbsp; We could go on and on about studies on both sides of the vegetarian argument and I do agree that we go too far with hormones injections, genetically altering animals or plant foods (what happened to the long lasting tomatoes?).&nbsp; :D&nbsp; I have read hundreds of reports linking environmental issues to health effects, red meat, meat in general, Mercury or other pollutants in our fish and the &quot;fallout&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />F&#039; it, you live once...enjoy those things that mentally and emotionally reward you.&nbsp; Learning how to eat a balance meal and in overall healthy moderation is sometimes difficult but it is achievable.&nbsp; If an ethical issue evolves because of what you consume than explore it and act on your instincts at first but educate yourself before making an assessment AND always ask a qualified professional before drastically changing your diet.&nbsp; Seeing an animal slaughtered could awaken your anthropomorphic feelings toward them, and usually for our own selfish reasons wish to do something about it.&nbsp; We live in a time of the mad scientist but as people become truly educated they become more open minded, I find.&nbsp; I personally won&#039;t impose or attempt to educate people about what my personal beliefs are but I won&#039;t apologize for my so called immoral behavior just because I eat meat or fish from my local butcher or shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the &quot;fall out&quot; subject brought up here in fact is very interesting and would make for a wonderful thread that will arise opinions and possibly entice people to open up and write.&nbsp; They can relay real time information about ethics, religion, foods, eating habits and health effects but this is not the thread for carnivore, vegeterian or omnivore bashing or demonizing.&nbsp; In the meantime I have to take a shower and hit the bed due to an early meeting to see an attorney selling his vehicle since mine was wrecked on Monday.&nbsp; I think I will stop at Keens chop house for a glass (or two) of Merlot and one of those big shrimp cocktail thingies.</span>&nbsp; :smitten: :smitten:

				Native,<br /><br />I am in agreement with almost everything you said, except the part about your &quot;immoral&quot; eating habits.&nbsp; Nobody on this thread alleged anything about the morality or immorality of eating meat.<br /><br />I would always hope, whatever the issue, that people inform themselves as best they can and then use their own intelligence and instincts to decide how they want to proceed.&nbsp; There are many pathways to good health and diet is only a part of the picture.<br /><br />To everyone&#039;s good health :rockon:

				Here you go bellabella..........<br /><br />I make my sofrtio a couple of times a year by freezing it in ice trays popping them out and placing them in a zip lock bag. &nbsp;That way when I need a little or alot it&#039;s there. &nbsp;I use sofrito in my beans, stews, picadillo, chili even my posole!<br /><br />2 &nbsp;x-tra large onions (or 3 large)<br />2 heads of garlic<br />1 bunch of recao &nbsp;(culantro)<br />2 bunches of cilantro <br />1 red bell pepper<br />1 green bell pepper<br />1 Italian banana pepper or frying pepper<br />1 jalapeno pepper <br />1 poblano pepper<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Peel onions and garlic, chopped coarsely. &nbsp;Wash all peppers, removing seeds and coarsely chop. &nbsp;Wash recao and cilantro, coarsely chopped. &nbsp;Place all ingredients in blender. &nbsp;Blend in batches to assure uniform texture. &nbsp;It is often necessary to add a bit of water or olive oil to blend properly. &nbsp; Makes around 4 ice trays or about<br />&nbsp;4 1/2 &nbsp;cups.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My sofrito differs from many due to the fact that I don&#039;t add tomatoes and my addition of a jalapeno pepper but this is what I love about cooking you can make a recipe your own.....Enjoy!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=5402.msg35163#msg35163">Quote from: bellabella on October 26, 2010, 09:22:55 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">griswold Please share what you use in your &nbsp;sofrito.

The OG Irish used to use pork belly instead of the contemporary beef brisket because cattle in Ireland were used primarily for dairy. When they came to NYC, many of the butchers/deli&#039;s were owned by Jews, so they didn&#039;t carry pork. The Irish had to substitute brisket, which was similar enough in texture once braised, for the recipe.&nbsp; Food history is fascinating.

				Okay. I agree to disagree. Perhaps I&#039;m spoiled having lived in places that have multiple bakeries that all make their own pastries and breads. And even being by supermarkets that have superior quality baguettes baked goods. It was very frustrating and bumming coming to this neighborhood and not being able to find a decent baguette or Italian loaf.<br /><br />Native, I don&#039;t expect Canelle&#039;s to use a French press. I don&#039;t expect anyone to use a French press. But having an espresso machine would be a nice authentic touch. Making it by hand gives it love. And love is a great ingredient. Like having handmade pasta or grandma&#039;s cookies.<br /><br />If you like coffee, you should out Stumptown in the Ace Hotel. I think they have a cafe in Red Hook now, too. At home, I use a vacuum press and will never go back to French press after using it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=5402.msg35401#msg35401">Quote from: NYC Native on November 02, 2010, 12:51:40 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong>I think that we should assume that no mater wether the bakeries, eateries and whatever are french, Italian or whatever it is fair to say that most places will have their hit and miss.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to canelles and they are very good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Noe to be fair I had their red Velvet cake and while i thought it tasted fine I only have it a couple of times before and I am not a big fan of pastries overall.&nbsp; With that said if you ask me about good Creme Brulee or Flan.

				Native,<br /><br />Were they fresh Maine lobsters or those weird frozen spotty ones? Those spots have always creeped me out.

				<strong>I went to Valentino&#039;s on the Green (former Caffe on the green - Bayside, right off the Cross island) &nbsp;- I guess it being the former home of Valentino the name is adequate. &nbsp;The menu has a big black &amp; White photo of Valentino in front. &nbsp;I went during lunch time and the place had a dozen patrons or so. &nbsp;Looks very similar to the old on the green with a few touches, but I don&#039;t remember the old place that well, since it has been almost a decade since I patronize the place. &nbsp;They are supposed to be working on a cigar area outside with a bar. &nbsp;It sounded like it would be fun to come back when it is done. &nbsp;<br /><br />I went there for lunch with my friend Danny and he was very hungry. &nbsp;I ordered the Merlot and Dan ordered the Cabernet. We were served with great enthusiasm and professionalism - the waiter was very courteous and cracked a couple of jokes. &nbsp;We shared the tomato and Mozzarella - it was OK but they would have benefited from a nicer picked tomato. &nbsp;They put a couple of slivers of red onions which I didn&#039;t understand, because it was barely sufficient for even one tomato (i guess they used it as a garnish &nbsp; ???) &nbsp;In my opinion, either put a couple of healthy slices of sweet onions or don&#039;t put any. &nbsp;Dan also ordered the eggplant soup which he said was great. &nbsp;<br /><br />The small bread basket was very nice and varied, but all of the breads were very chewy. &nbsp;Dan also ordered the fillet of sea bass which I tried and I found very bland, even with the fancy sauce. &nbsp;I ordered the ossobucco (hey, pattern &nbsp;:2funny:). &nbsp;It was served with flame grilled veggies and a polenta, but I have to tell you <span style="font-size: 17pt;" class="bbc_size">WOW!</span> &nbsp;It was a home run, and not just the the meat but the polenta was creamy but not runny, the veggies were crispy and smokey. When Danny tried it he paused and looked at me - he said &quot;I ordered the wrong dish&quot;. &nbsp;I will come back sometime during one evening and let you guys know about the ambiance and food in th evening. &nbsp;In the old days the spot was stigmatized but the building is very pretty and would be a shame not to patronize it if the food turns out to consistently good. &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;

				<strong>I was a tourist in LIC this weekend and decided to explore some on the waterfront eateries. &nbsp;On Friday evening I went to Water&#039;s Edge. &nbsp;I only went there a couple of times but never for an actual sit down dinner. &nbsp;First, I have to say that this is probably one of the best views of the city from any location in Queens. &nbsp;If you have someone you really want to treat, do this for them. &nbsp;The place is white cloth and very classy. &nbsp;The place is also large and somewhat expensive for Queens standards so I think you&#039;ll probaby have no problems getting a table. &nbsp;The wait staff seems to all be from the same town &nbsp;:D, so English IS their second language (or 3rd). &nbsp;Nevertheless, they were very nice and attentive. &nbsp;<br /><br />We started with some sort of Lobster chunk salad which was very light and refreshing, it had small pieces of mango and cheese. &nbsp;The wife had duck and the sist in law had asparagus soup (I think). &nbsp;Sist had the sea bass, wife had the Prime rib and I had a combo plate called the Veal Oscar. &nbsp;It was very tasty, the Veal was a bit chewy but the Crab Ravioli was surprisingly large and memorable and paired well with the fried Kale. &nbsp;I tried the prime rib (NO kidding) &nbsp;:2funny:, it was also surprisingly well seasoned and it was served with a gigantic potato croquette which you would either love or dislike. &nbsp;They used bluecheese in the mix so as you can imagine, it overpowers the potato flavor. &nbsp;<br /><br />On Sunday we did brunch at the Penthouse888, which is located on the top floor on the Ravel Hotel at 8-08 Queens Plaza South. &nbsp;It was raining and while you could not fully appreciate the panoramic view of NY I can honestly say it should be breathtaking during the evening. &nbsp;The tables were cheap looking and the laminate floors were falling apart by the locale more than made up for these shortcomings. &nbsp;We were promptly seated and the brunch menu was small as expected. &nbsp;They offered unlimited mimosa and bloodymaires for 9.99. &nbsp;The pre-fix for the meal was $25 but they offered a la carte eggs, bagels and some sides as well. &nbsp;We &nbsp;had the grilled asparagus and also the crispy spring rolls which were filled with crapmeat as starters. &nbsp;We also had the eggs Benedict and they were served on a croissant instead of the traditional English Muffing and the meatlovers omelette.<br /><br />Far from being a gourmet meal the brunch, while not memorable by a long stretch was fine and it has enticed me to come back some other time in the evening. &nbsp;I will hope we get a nice evening this week so I can return and have a couple of drinks at the bar and look at our great city evening lights. &nbsp;The restaurant has an outside area which has got to be one amazing spot to chill out on a summer night. &nbsp;REMEMBER PEOPLE, sometimes playing the tourist in your own town reminds us why living in NYC is such a great thing.</strong><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">http://www.penthouse808rooftop.com/ (http://www.penthouse808rooftop.com/)<br /><br /><br />http://www.watersedgenyc.com/</span>

				My husband and I ate at Armando&#039;s. I had the branzino special, really tasty, perfectly grilled. The Armando salad is delicious. They also make a great penne vodka. I love sinking into their leather booths or sitting a table for two at the window, especially on a Friday night after a long work week. It&#039;s like an oasis in the neighborhood. Familiar faces, cozy leather booths, quiet (not too much street noise filtering in), free bruschetta appetizer to whet your appetite (but I&#039;m generally already hungry when I get there). The owner, Jerry, is warm and friendly and down to earth and always stops by your table to say hello and chat. I guess you can tell how much I like this dining experience. http://www.armondositalianrestaurant.com/

				I heard that the food there is awful.

				I&#039;ve never eaten there, so I can&#039;t really talk trash. But I&#039;ve heard bad things from fellow cooks, who are a very hard breed to please. Thanks for the dining tips, but as a professional cook, I&#039;m pretty sure I know how to eat out properly. &nbsp;;)<br /><br />The nice thing about being in the business is the hook up.

				<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">For those that find themselves going out often...Opentable will credit you 100 Points every time you use their site to make reserva3ions.&nbsp; Some reservation time slots will get you 1000 points.&nbsp; With 2,000 points you get $ 20 Dining Cheque / $50 at 5,000 points and $100 with 10,000 point.&nbsp; You can redeem them for OpenTable Dining Cheques and use them in your favorite restaurants. They also have $25 for $50 promotions at several restaurants.&nbsp; What I have found about these type of promotions is that the saving of a few dollars is nice but the real treat is that it becomes fun for those that engage in exploring new places.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do as I say, not as I do&nbsp; :D.&nbsp; I have only used them a handful of times when I&#039;m on my way to a place during a weekend, but they have a new smartphone app and maybe it will make it easier and convenient to use.&nbsp; I&#039;m on the field most the time so I usually just walk into a place nearest my current location, except during weekends.</span><br /><br /><strong>http://www.opentable.com/home.aspx</strong>

				slightly prejudiced -- knowing the owners -- but I do go to sullivan bistro when I work in the west village. &nbsp;the food is very good.<br /><br />here in JHs, when I&#039;m in the mood for steak,&nbsp; I tend to eat more often at La Cabana on Northern bet. 86/87. &nbsp;

				<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>&quot;la Gloria&quot;</strong></span> <em><strong>on Saturday. &nbsp;Cute and cozy with a daring decor. &nbsp;I think they did a good job incorporating and hidding the kitchen. &nbsp;The small Menu makes it easy to chose your dishes but some patrons may not like that fact. &nbsp;Looks like the bar can get really friendly later in the evenings. &nbsp;The Ceviche mixto was good, the croquetas were extremely dry but it was served with some greens in a really delicious vinaigrette. &nbsp;The ropa vieja with polenta could have done without the bean soup but they had the right idea. &nbsp;I would get rid of the bean soup it&#039;s immersed in and just put the ropa vieja on a creamier polenta - I think that would be memorable. &nbsp;The snapper had too much breading and way too crispy and dry for my personal taste. &nbsp;Maybe I was expecting a traditional pargo frito with no breading, but if the fillet weren&#039;t so over done I think it would have been a nicer entree. <br /><br />The pork dish was very tender and well seasoned so it might be borderline salty for some...again, one of those dishes I wish they would skip heavy sauces. In my opinion, Roasted pork needs very little messing with (outside of a mojito isleno or similar). &nbsp;The mariquitas were served with guacamole that tasted fresh. The sangria was &quot;spritzy&#039; or maybe had some champagne or something like that in it. &nbsp;It was OK but I don&#039;t like my red sangria to taste &quot;white sangria&quot; like. &nbsp;Sangria is one of those things that have too many variations and establishments like to get creative with. &nbsp;The Waiter was a very nice and attentive young man, unfortunately he knew nothing of the dishes, every time I asked about how the dish is made, he had to get the bartender &nbsp;???. &nbsp;I would go again but maybe to the bar and try out some of the other appetizers. &nbsp;It&#039;s an interesting spot and has the potential to improve if they wouldn&#039;t try so hard to over-manipulate what is otherwise simple traditional Latin dishes</strong></em>. 8)<br /><br /><br /><div align="center">(http://i.picasion.com/pic40/8cf2f1124bf20c1ec05b4d1102c6f411.gif)</div>

				Yesterday<br /><strong><br />Crabtrees...Floral Park<br /><br />Merlot was silky and yummy!!!&nbsp; Scallops were fried than sauted.&nbsp; Nice but I wont try them like than again.&nbsp; The Angus Rib eye was good but a bit over charred - absolutely delish anyway.&nbsp; The duck was super and as always, the cuscuss and rice as well as the beets - two thumbs up.&nbsp; The boy choy was OK, but then again - what do I know about it? (http://i.picasion.com/pic40/91a64754e8652f0e6e038cfef28f287a.gif) <br /><br /><br />Today, GaBana on Northern Blvd,&nbsp; Place was sort of empty.&nbsp; It is the first time I go, Valet starts at 7 PM but I got there at 6:45.&nbsp; I got lucky and found a spot right across the street.&nbsp; I ordered the Merlot but wish I didn&#039;t (vinagre).&nbsp; I then asked to get sangria and it was nice.&nbsp; I dropped the <del>vinegar </del> Merlot into the sangria and It was perfect.&nbsp; :2funny:.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ceviche sampler was fine.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like my ceviche the way it is done there...tons of everything else, including ketchup or tomato sauces and minuscule seafood.&nbsp; The waitress was missing in action most of the time (but I think they had some sort of meeting according to the other waiters).&nbsp; The puerquito was salty but very tender.&nbsp; (my advise, more spices - less salt).&nbsp; The garlic mojo was identical to the one in Willies steak house in the Bronx (two thumbs up) . The surf and turf was nicely presented BUT disappointing in flavor - while they claim the shrimp was sauted, it was, in my opinion, steamed or boiled then introduced to the pan after it was cooked.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Yuca mash was not right.&nbsp; They made it like they were making majao de platano, or as Domincans call it &quot;Mangu&quot;,&nbsp; When you mash platanos, you add a bit of the water you boil it in to accentuate the flavor plus whatever else you may want to add to it, butter, milk of just as is.&nbsp; With Cassava /&nbsp; Yuca you don&#039;t.&nbsp; The Yuca has too much almidon or starch.&nbsp; You boil it (over boiled a bit it is better) then you drain it and let it cool off that steam.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t, then you end up with what we got today...a tasty yuca but with a sticky , chewy ending.&nbsp; <br /><br />The tostones were thin and crispy and Lukas X was happy&nbsp; :smitten:.&nbsp; I like the place but again, Gabana has the right idea and it is a cozy spot.&nbsp; I would not mind coming back to have a few drinks but I can say that they are not in the right track with the dishes I had today -they should go back to basics on some other items.&nbsp; I like the place, I will come back with a few foodie friends and try some of the other dishes and see how it pans out.</strong><br /><br />

				LAST FRIDAY<br /><br /><strong>Well, I am embarrassed to say..I never went to La Cabana before. &nbsp;This is Truly a neighborhood spot. &nbsp;Small but it somehow felt like a big place due to its open cafe style front wall/door.<br /><br />I liked the exposed bricks and I must say...the parrillada was very good for the $$. &nbsp;Polite and quick service. &nbsp;The sangria was actually surprisingly good and while I wasn&#039;t a big fan of the saucy appetizer...it was big and sufficient for 4 people. &nbsp;I think I found a new place in Queens to eat.<br /><br />Also, we met the cutest little girl - the parents were there with their parents from Baltimore. &nbsp;They were the type of people you want as neighbors. &nbsp;The little girl was precious and my son was in haven, dancing with her. &nbsp;It was a memorable evening in Jackson Hts. &nbsp;Thank You! :smitten:</strong>

				I went back to Gabana. &nbsp;I went to the bar with one of my supervisors working for us at this time. &nbsp;It was OK. &nbsp;I was pleased that they had a bottle of barrilito 3 stars. &nbsp;Unfortunately, we were surprised that they didn&#039;t carry Bacardi gold, select or silver &nbsp;:o &nbsp;:o &nbsp;:o . &nbsp;<span class="bbc_u"><strong>We can read between the lines</strong></span>.... :police: . &nbsp;When we left the spot, I tipped the valet $3 but he stopped me and then told me it was $10. &nbsp;I looked around to see the sign - I asked the valet &quot;where did you post your fee?&quot; &nbsp;He looked at me and told me..&quot;Hey, if you don&#039;t have it&quot;<br /><br />That really pissed me off...REALLY. &nbsp;Not only the food is below average and all they are doing is imitating the true Nuevo Latino - They suck at it. &nbsp;They have &nbsp;poorly trained waiters, bartenders and hostesses and then, they have the Balls to charge people for Valet parking and not post or tell the client when it is parked. &nbsp;Hear me Gabanna...You guys suck, Your food Sucks, Your drinks are over priced (I paid $70 for 4 drinks) ...you have a nice looking place (Can You say $39 chars from IKEA?) <span style="font-size: 13pt;" class="bbc_size">but I can&#039;t eat your decor</span>. &nbsp;Whomever you are that owns this place <span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>(I mean, the real owners - not the front). &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;</span> Fire your manager, fire your wait staff and your bartenders,<br /><br />Start fresh...close the place for 2 or 3 weeks. &nbsp;Get educated and train your personnel. &nbsp;Your food, hey - no one minds paying for simple quality food. &nbsp;You can dress it up, and in a pretty place like what you have, we don&#039;t mind paying a few dollars more. &nbsp;But guess what...can we have it good and consistent? &nbsp;<br /><br />The neighborhood deserves Better!!

				Went to Phayul, a youngish Tibetan place on 37th Road (the little st. south of 37th Ave. and north of Roosevelt, in the vicinity of 74th/75t st.).&nbsp; Had seen a review on the Edible Queens blog.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; Tiny and homey, obviously a family joint, kitchen is &quot;open&quot; because it&#039;s basically part of the same room.&nbsp; Had some momos, which I liked but am not an expert, some stir-fried box choy (not overcooked, w a nice touch some green onion), and two dishes that were much more robust than other Tibetan/Himalayan I&#039;ve had -- blood sausage, lamb I think, w/ a fairly significant liver content and some Sichuan flavors (the cuisine is Chinese-influenced), and something that was described as sliced pork that basically turned out to be the Tibetan equivalent of bacon, cooked w/ a lot of leeks, a little black bean sauce, and LOTS of heat.&nbsp; It&#039;s upstairs, and you get a bit of a view of a teeming section of 74th St. -- maybe this doesn&#039;t excite everyone, but I felt like I was really experiencing the city and the neighborhood.&nbsp; I thought this place was wonderful.<br />&nbsp;
