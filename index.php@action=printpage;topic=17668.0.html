				Was considering going to Addictive to eat/drink.&nbsp; My partner searched the DOH website (this is his usual practice as he is in the business), only to find they had received 29 violation points, four of which were critical.&nbsp; Does anyone know if they were closed?&nbsp;

				Not so far as I know. Have eaten there with no issues, will continue to eat there. Given Francisco&#039;s insistence on detail and order, I&#039;m a little surprised at their findings. This is the only place I&#039;ve seen in the neighborhood that the back of house staff actually take a few minutes of their down time, in between orders coming into to the kitchen area, to actually police and wipe down their work area and equipment without anyone actually telling them to do so.

				What&#039;s the point of this thread? Asking about citations that you allegedly just saw seems less about asking for an update than it is about announcing it to the world. If you really wanted to know, you could&#039;ve easily called the restaurant or DOH itself. I can&#039;t even confirm the citation points you cited because the DOH website is showing errors, so you&#039;ve now just created this presumption that others will just rely on because they can&#039;t discredit it easily. <br />

If you had a point, you&#039;d point out exactly what of the specific circumstances at hand supports your conclusion that there is subterfuge. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been on this board for awhile and I have found captainflannel&#039;s posts to be some of the most reasonable whereas some of you sound petulant.

				From the Department of Health:<br />&quot;Violations recorded in the following area (s) and a Notice of Violation issued at the initial operational pre-permit inspection conducted on 03/09/2018.<br />&quot;Critical&quot; violations are displayed in red.<br />Violation points: 29<br />Sanitary Violations<br />1) Hot food item not held at or above 140º F.<br />2) Cold food item held above 41º F (smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 ºF) except during necessary preparation.<br />3) Personal cleanliness inadequate. Outer garment soiled with possible contaminant. Effective hair restraint not worn in an area where food is prepared.<br />4) Wiping cloths soiled or not stored in sanitizing solution.<br />5) Proper sanitization not provided for utensil ware washing operation.&quot; <br />By the way, from this citation it looks like they closed the place under the old name and are trying to re-open under a similar name.

				^without knowing specifics, reports don&#039;t tell you much. For example, the danger zone is food left at temperatures above 40 and below 180 (I think that&#039;s the range) for four hours and not thrown out, but without a time stamp on the food, the restaurant can&#039;t prove it hasn&#039;t been in the danger zone for four hours. (Think about a cheese plate.) Possible contaminate on an outer garment, is that a real issue or is it just some food splashed up on the line cook&#039;s Chef jacket or apron? Proper sanitization for wares not being followed could just be that the dishwasher needs to be trained to change the sanitizing solution in the sink a bit more (that&#039;s the three sink commercial set up - wash, rinse, sanitize, air dry).<br /><br />

				Here is a more sensible explanation from another state<br /><br />http://www.idph.state.il.us/about/fdd/fdd_fs_foodservice.htm (http://www.idph.state.il.us/about/fdd/fdd_fs_foodservice.htm)<br /><br /><em>&quot;Remember the danger zone: 41º F - 135º F. Potentially hazardous foods exposed to this temperature range for a cumulative total of more than 4 hours are not safe to eat.&quot;</em><br /><br />DOH rules and what&#039;s actually unsafe are two separate things. Like, no one is flipping out at their Aunt&#039;s BBQ or getting food poisoning because the deviled eggs have been sitting out on the buffet for 40 minutes. A good example of how arbitrary DOH rules can be are fine dining establishments which many times will actually have procedures in place to shut down the line and toss X, Y &amp; Z before the inspection begins (and the DOH allows it) because how high end food is prepared and served is different than some DOH rules. DOH violations can be rather arbitrary too (and some restaurants will challenge them), like the place I know who got dinged for lettuce for a salad being at an unsafe temperature when it was on a prep table to prepare a salad (the restaurant successfully challenged that one).<br /><br />And then you look at this guidance from Australia, and they use a 2 hour/4 hour rule.&nbsp; <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/3dd213804376220b92dcdfc9302c1003/2+hour+4+hour+Rule+%28poster%29.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-3dd213804376220b92dcdfc9302c1003-lGa44kg</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ultimately they all have the same goal - keeping people safe. Some governmental agencies air much, much farther on the side of safety than others. And it&#039;s worth keeping in mind when reading a report of DOH violations. (It&#039;s easier when you have or know someone who has earned a food protection certificate from the DOH.)

				<br />Dear JHResident,<br /><br />First, I wanted to said we didn&#039;t &quot;re-open&quot; under Addictive Wine &amp; Tapas 1&quot;, we opened a new, bigger wine bar to accommodate our growing customers. Yes, we did get an A on the smaller wine bar in 2016. That hasn&#039;t changed. The city have not been back for a new inspection. And for your information, we didn&#039;t &quot;CLOSED&quot; the small wine and tapas, we made some small changes on the interior to make it suitable for events. <br />On a businee perspective, I don&#039;t want to have two businesses under the same name. Therefore, we rename to Addictive 87. It&#039;s now an Event Space and Fine Dining. <br /><br />As for the recent inspection, it was a preliminary inspection. They did not issue us a grade. They will be back for actual inspection. If you have been to my wine bar, you know we have an open kitchen concept. Seating by the kitchen bar, you will see through the windows my chefs are working and preparing tapas with fully gloved. Sanitary has always and will always be our number one priority. One thing I have learned about Department of Health inspections is that even if you get an A grade, you still responsible for certains minor violation here and there. On 03/09/2018 when the inspector came, it was an extreme busy night, we just emptied out the table wipe bucket and refilled with fresh water as the inspector walked in, we didn&#039;t get a chance to properly add sanitize liquid to the water. Another instance, my bartender just started his shift for the night and he walked pass the kitchen area to get to the bar, and that was a 5 point deduction. <br /><br />I normally don&#039;t posts on Jacksonheightslife, but I am glad I did see this post today. It is a restaurant owner and responsibility to maintain a clean and healthy environment for the public and certainly we live up to that in all account. Thank you for all the coments being post here. I am sure many of you have dined at my wine bar and you see how we run our restaurant. Your expectation is our priority and we hope you see that through us. <br /><br />Thank you.&nbsp; <br />Patrick<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=17668.msg84865.html#msg84865">Quote from: JHResident on April 02, 2018, 04:10:20 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From the Department of Health:<br />&quot;Violations recorded in the following area (s) and a Notice of Violation issued at the initial operational pre-permit inspection conducted on 03/09/2018.<br />&quot;Critical&quot; violations are displayed in red.<br />Violation points: 29<br />Sanitary Violations<br />1) Hot food item not held at or above 140º F.<br />2) Cold food item held above 41º F (smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 ºF) except during necessary preparation.<br />3) Personal cleanliness inadequate.

Yes, we did get an A on the smaller wine bar in 2016. That hasn&#039;t changed. The city have not been back for a new inspection. And for your information, we didn&#039;t &quot;CLOSED&quot; the small wine and tapas, we made some small changes on the interior to make it suitable for events. <br />On a businee perspective, I don&#039;t want to have two businesses under the same name. Therefore, we rename to Addictive 87. It&#039;s now an Event Space and Fine Dining. <br /><br />As for the recent inspection, it was a preliminary inspection. They did not issue us a grade. They will be back for actual inspection. If you have been to my wine bar, you know we have an open kitchen concept. Seating by the kitchen bar, you will see through the windows my chefs are working and preparing tapas with fully gloved. Sanitary has always and will always be our number one priority.
