				http://www.chowhound.com/topics/532717<br /><br />An innocent remark of mine turned into a heated debate on chowhound. What do you guys think?<br /><br />My two cents: I moved here for the food and the diversity. I speak Spanish and a few other languages, and I have absolutely no qualms sampling food from street carts or steam tables or fried chicken joints. To me, JH and its surrounding neighborhoods are a glorious amalgamation of cultures and peoples. It&#039;s not merely Indian/Bangladeshi and Colombian/Ecuadorian/Mexican/Peruvian - I see little pockets of Eastern Europeans, Filipino, Nepali, Korean and Thai as well as others who don&#039;t fit into the above categories. It frustrates me when others people - the media, other foodies - try to impose a monolithic image of JH as a Latino or Indian community <em>only</em>. It&#039;s not just that. And to summarily dismiss the notion that tea shops or wine bars would work here or are wanted by the community because...what? they can&#039;t afford it? they can&#039;t appreciate it? it&#039;s pretentious and gentrified? only white people or yuppies drink tea or wine? is elitist. I feel that these people are trying to mold JH into something that exists in their minds. <br /><br />Starbucks and E77 are doing well. They are drawing a very diverse crowd, and as I&#039;ve mentioned in CH, are clearly fulfilling a previously unfulfilled need.&nbsp; There are people willing to pay inflated prices for coffee. Sure I can take a train a couple stops or go to Manhattan for tea or wine or fancy coffee, but why not keep the money and jobs in the neighborhood? I don&#039;t drink coffee and sometimes I just want to grab a quick cup of tea and pastries before heading onto the train. And I don&#039;t think one or - gasp - two tea places or wine bars would dilute the &quot;character&quot; of JH. A sign of further things to come? Would JH fall to the yuppies once they&#039;ve inserted a wine bar?<br /><br />Wow, that was quite a rant for the morning. I am off to make some tea to calm myself down!&nbsp; :angel:

				All I can say is that if anyone is interested in reading the whole chowhound discussion linked above, better go read it fast because the whole thread basically devolves into a rant against gentrification - and anything not specifically about good generally gets deleted on chowhound.

				yt28 we&#039;ve also had this similar conversation (strong Pros and Cons) here on this thread:<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=581.0<br /><br />if you go to &quot;search&quot; above and type in &quot;wine bar&quot; or &quot;french bistro&quot;, &quot;gentrification&quot; etc etc you&#039;ll see all the conversations on the changing nature of this community: who&#039;s for it, against it. &nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m with you. &nbsp;We need a little more diversity here in the way of places to sit and chill or hang out with friends. &nbsp;don&#039;t take the disagreements personal. &nbsp;<br /><br />

				No, not taking it personal. Just very puzzled and also annoyed at the &quot;I know what&#039;s best for JH&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;I speak some Spanish, I&#039;m soooo down with the immigrants&quot; attitude that some people have.

				I actually think a tea house would be awesome for Jackson Heights. When I visited southern Spain last year, they had some fantastic tea houses that cater to all sorts of people but especially to young Muslims, who would socialize over tea rather than at a bar. I can see a similar tea house working in this neighborhood. You could get an infusion of cardamom tea with a plate of cookies and figs... mmmmm...

A lot of African countries I&#039;ve been to have informal tea houses with snacks; there are also tea places in Japan and China. A tea place doesn&#039;t have to mean a high-class yuppified joint with generic tea choices.

That just doesn&#039;t play true here.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see a nice wine bar with a selection from around the world or a tea house for that matter in Jackson Heights ( I&#039;m not too much of a tea drinkers but it sounds great to me ).&nbsp;

				Forgive this naive non-drinker... I can&#039;t really picture what you mean by a wine bar.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen tapas bars with nice wine selections.&nbsp; But we have one of these already, at Jardi (http://cityguide.aol.com/newyork/restaurants/jardi/v-304870).<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to a Viennese Heurigen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heurigen), which is like a wine version of a beer garden (it was a hoot, and they had great grape juice!), but I doubt that&#039;s what you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />Is a wine bar something like a tasting room at a wine shop or a winery?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or something more cafe-like?&nbsp; <br /><br />In any case, I don&#039;t wish to side with the people trying to pigeonhole Jackson Heights, but I&#039;m not sure I can envision a place focused exclusively on wine doing very well here.&nbsp; &nbsp;It wouldn&#039;t appeal to the nightclubbing/sports bar crowds on Roosevelt and Northern, and I don&#039;t see too much of an evening/late night scene otherwise here in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I would think a wine bar would need to be part of a good full-service restaurant (like a bistro) to make it.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand, we have a vibrant and under-served daytime scene -- a tea place would be a great fit.<br /><br />

				Actually, I could see a place here that was tea house by day, wine bar by night...<br /><br />As for what a wine bar is, they usually have an extensive by-the-glass wine list (as well as bottles) and also serve small bites and cheese plates and other goodies. A good wine bar is a great way to spend an evening.

				Sounds perfect to me Jennsch!&nbsp; I envision the tea bar/wine bar to be on the corner of 76Th street and 37Th Avenue...or on a side street there abouts.&nbsp; &quot;NOT&quot; on Roosevelt or Northern. Those venues are totally incongruent with the atmosphere you&#039;d want to create.&nbsp; A garden in the back would be a dream come true. I think that you&#039;d&nbsp; get people on their way home from work, or friends meeting after work or people out on their way to dinner or people celebrating a birthday or &quot;dates&quot;.&nbsp; It would give you an option in the hood ......by serving food with&nbsp; a bit of a twist.&nbsp; There would most certainly have to be food.&nbsp; But food which is simple, fresh, and itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;By &quot;simple&quot; food, I mean food that stands on its&#039; own merit. Sauteed zucchini flowers,&nbsp; pate, cured meats, cheeses. ..that kind of thing.&nbsp; The tea bar would attract business from schools, families with children, white collar professionals, bankers etc. for tea and again a simple food menu....wraps, omelets, soups and....TEA...lots and lots of TEA! NOT COFFEE!! We&#039;ll call it&nbsp; &quot;A Cup of Wine&quot; or &quot;A Glass Of TEA&quot;---Bar .&nbsp; There. It&#039;s settled. Now... whose gonna give me a billion dollars to pay the rent.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				A wine bar is sorely needed in the neighborhood and would serve a vast unmet need.<br /><br />It&#039;s incredibly condescending to say that JH&#039;s large population of recent immigrants and members of various ethnic groups wouldn&#039;t appreciate a nice glass of wine in a stylish venue.&nbsp; With so many vacant storefronts, it&#039;s also absurd to pretend that one new wine bar would displace the dollar stores or the money changers or the hair salons.<br /><br />Until we have more dining and drinking options in Jackson Heights, we&#039;ll continue to be NY&#039;s neighborhood with the most good food and the fewest good restaurants.<br /><br />

				A tea / Wine bar option is a great idea for JH. I have several friends who are clamoring for a quite comfortable place to go for a drink especially on summer evenings. And I&#039;d take a tea house over a chicken place any day... did we really NEED the new on on 37t ave. ? <br /><br />There is (or perhaps was because I think it&#039;s closed now) a cafe place that served wine &amp; beer Oleput in Astoria on Ditmars about a block off 32st St. An idea like that would fit quite well in JH. However, any place that opened here would have to have servers who understood that being nice to customers is good for business.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Another thought occurs to me. With the economy being what it is, and where it&#039;s headed I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s the wisest time to open a wine bar / tea house. A few weeks ago some friends and I were out at a wine bar in Astoria that we enjoy going to. After a short evening and a few glasses of wine we came away with a jaw dropping bill and couldn&#039;t quite justify the price, especially when we realized we could have bought a couple of cases of wine for what amounted to two and a half bottles at the bar. Maybe that&#039;s unique to the place we were (and we weren&#039;t even drinking the expensive stuff), however as budgets are cut, gas prices rise, and my job security depends on the whims of politicians and &quot;generous&quot; donors I find my self cutting back on what in the past were slightly more affordable nights out. I would think that I&#039;m not the only person doing this right now.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m sure there&#039;s something to that, Aronan.<br /><br />However, it might also be that if people are spending less, they&#039;d choose a local Jackson Heights wine bar over the more expensive Manhattan options.<br /><br />Whatever else you might say about Jackson Heights, it&#039;s a wonderful neighborhood when you want to economize! 8)

				YES! I am newish to neighborhood and had no idea where to go for a drink with a friend who was seeing me home after a movie. I thought Novo might be good, but at 1 am it was not a quiet restaurant where you could a glass of wine and have a conversation. Pumping music (to 11!) that made my heart vibrate and i could not hear one word my friend was saying. I am surprised the coops behind Novo allow that kind of noise. <br /><br />Anyway, just one tiny place that serves tea during the day and wine at night with medium decibel music is needed !!&nbsp; Preferably right where Novo is ... or maybe that empty space next to Espresso 77?

				My favorite bottle of wine usually costs me around $10, so when I see it at a restaurant at $8 per glass, it certainly is a bit difficult to pay for. But then I remind myself that I&#039;m paying more for the social aspect of being there, the service, the ambience, etcetera.<br /><br />Also, $6 for a glass of wine seems like a pretty good deal to me, especially when prices in nearly any part of the city are hovering around $8-12.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure everyone is having less nights out these days, but $6 is a good deal if you do decide to venture out and not be a hermit.

				I agree with spanishfish.&nbsp; There are times when you want to head on out with friends for a good time.&nbsp; I also agree that in this economy one has to watch spending, but if Iâ€™m out for a bite or a drink, I realize that included in the cost will be service, ambiance, etc.&nbsp; That said, I think it makes sense to choose businesses that are customer friendly and serve quality products.&nbsp; Espresso 77 is a good example.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve always had a good time there with my husband and/or friends, and weâ€™re always made to feel welcomed by the staff.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTW, Shelby2 said it best....
