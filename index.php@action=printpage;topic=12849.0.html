				he&#039;s been talking about this for a few years now. i always liked his sicilian pies/slices, but he&#039;s grown dispirited -- been at it for 30 or so years with very little break.<br /><br />before anyone gets any grand ideas about what could go in, take the size of the place into consideration -- fast casual tends to need a lot more space than that. the kitchen is decently sized, and if the counter area were converted into more tables, it might seat 50 or so (guessing), so a sitdown isn&#039;t out of the question. a wine bar is out of the question, though. community board would never, ever approve a booze business (like it or not, a wine bar is a bar) 100 feet from an elementary school.

Both of those have to be within 200 feet if you draw a straight line from the edge of the property. Maybe Arunee would scrape by just a smidge over 200 ft, hard to tell. The school is officially on 37th Ave, so technically they are on the same street as the school. It&#039;s possible E77 could escape it by not meeting both of the AND requirements by being on 77th street as an address instead of 37th ave, but Okawa is definitely in violation if this is the letter of the law.<br /><br />Novo was a blight on that strip, if they never shut Novo down being that close to the school with the crap that went on there, I&#039;m surprised PS69 itself doesn&#039;t have a tap room.

				there&#039;s the 500 foot rule, too, which is being used more and more by community boards. a restriction on number of liquor licenses within a 500 foot area. it&#039;s being used to take away restaurant licenses (which are up for renewal) in williamsburg, not that it&#039;s a stroller-and-bouncy-house community. that&#039;s our next battle in JH....&quot;we need more nice bars&quot; versus &quot;but think about the children!&quot;<br />

				it&#039;s selectivity, for sure. but there&#039;s the distance from schools, churches, residents who might not like noise from honking horns, drunken revelers, etc. it all comes into play. within five years, a bunch of the people pining for more pubs will be fighting against pubs opening. it&#039;s nature&#039;s way.

				Hi all, I&#039;m new to JH, and so far I&#039;m loving it:)&nbsp; I had a question about the yearly expenses for this location. The agent says 59000 per year. That comes out to 5000 per month. The rent must be really cheap if that includes salaries, rent, electricity, insurance, taxes, food costs, water, and all the other bills. Can the rent really be that low?

That works out to 5000 per month.&nbsp; The expenses should include the rent, salaries, gas, electric, insurance, taxes, food, permits, license, health dept, workmans comp, ect,etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if it&#039;s a one man operation, he has to be paid at least a grand a week.

				Rent at Tripple net of $60,000 per year plus $25,000 per year for six years for &quot;key money&quot; is not cheap. It amounts to $510,000 over six years, and a six year lease is in fact very unattractive to anyone who wants to invest money in the place.<br /><br />I note that several people have pointed out that there are a number of establishments within spitting distance of the school that have liquor licenses. This might be because the 200&#039; rule is in fact not absolute, and that half-way mature adults may hold the view that selling alcohol is unlikely to corrupt kids, many delivered and picked up by their parents, aged six to about eleven.<br /><br />

				A new pizza place has opened on 37th and 86th. It&#039;s called La Boca. Formerly it was Party Pizza, which was (I think) deep dish. La Boca has retained some of Party Pizza&#039;s elements; perhaps La Boca bought in at a percentage of the franchise. But what&#039;s interesting is La Boca are the same folks that owned the Argentinean spot that was on 90th at the entrance to the train a few years back. They&#039;ve stayed with their low prices, and of course they sell fugazzetta. The place is brightly painted. The phone number is 718-651-3050

				I&#039;ve had just one slice. They advertise &quot;La Boca Argentina Pan Pizza.&quot; That may equate to deep dish; I&#039;m not an expert. I think they may be using the party pizza dough, which is not my favorite. It was good enough though, is near my apartment, affordable, has a clean, colorful interior, and I do like the owner and his loyal crew, so I will return. I&#039;d like to see it stick around for awhile. They offer a lot of other things as well. It&#039;s just slightly different enough to be interesting.

				As a resident of JH for several decades, &amp; a pizza lover who has had authentic brick oven pizza throughout Italy and from Manhattan&#039;s best places like Patsy&#039;s, Lombardi&#039;s, Grimaldi&#039;s (originally Brooklyn now one on 6th Av), John&#039;s, and Joe&#039;s, here&#039;s a list of joints in the neighborhood I adore:<br /><br />--Of course Romeo&#039;s which started this thread - same owner for decades...I used to love getting Italian ices there (not as many options as Lemon Ice King of Corona, but hey, it&#039;s walkable) It&#039;s been so empty lately though; how do they stay in business?<br /><br />--Louie&#039;s in Elmhurst (near La Fusta Steakhouse)... I daresay the best tasting pizza in Queens. The grandma pie is incredible; they also make a small yummy margarita pie (for half the price of the grandma). And the pizza guy is SO welcoming (Louie himself?) Plus they deliver throughout the area.<br /><br />--Pizza Boy (74th St at 37th Ave) - fresh, cheesy individual pies ... Plus a fabulous thin slice pizza option.<br /><br />--Thomas Pizza on 37th Ave (across from Downtown Market).&nbsp; I remember when Thomas from Italy owned it.&nbsp; He was a sweet, special man. He watched me grow up.&nbsp; Now it is owned by a new family (as of about 10 years ago), and for a while they were making delicious whole wheat pies.&nbsp; They discontinued those when they weren&#039;t selling as much.&nbsp; Their regular slices are still Thomas&#039; old recipe, a nice thin yet soft crust (like Pizza Boy&#039;s) They also make a delicious fresh mozzarella &amp; basil pie, if you get it delivered.<br /><br />--Gianni&#039;s off 82nd St (near the firehouse) <br /><br />--Due Fratelli (diagonally across from PS69 on 37th Ave) has modern decor, plus a lot of unique pizza options that are made fresh throughout the day (I like the mushroom&nbsp; pesto). <br /><br />--Mr Bruno&#039;s<br />(near Cannelle bakery) in East Elmhurst.&nbsp; It&#039;s spacious with big windows and they have some interesting combinations there too.<br /><br />

				<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">I think that a Manhattan style Pizzeria like a Patsy&#039;s isn&#039;t a stretch for a location that survived on what seems to be a mediocre pizza joint.&nbsp; JH is ready for just about anything you throw at it, especially if the Pizzeria has a decent wine list, quality lasagna and some traditional style dishes like sorrentino, piccata, scarpariello etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve never been a big pizza lover but if I&#039;m going to eat a couple of slices nothing but a thin, crispy crust will do it for me.&nbsp; I have nothing against a deep dish, its just way too much bread for my taste.&nbsp; <br /><br />My kids love Pizza, my 22 year old (when he visits from college in Boca) and my 6 year old.&nbsp; &nbsp;When they want Pizza and I want to sit down for something other than,&nbsp; I will always chose a white cloth like place that has good pizza but will have wine and other goodies for Dad.&nbsp; A place like Armondo&#039;s with the addition of a coal fired oven and sandwiches would do well in the strip I think.</span>

				Since the windows face PS 69, I&#039;m not sure the alcohol/school rule wouldn&#039;t apply. Esp. since the kids are in there at lunch time.
