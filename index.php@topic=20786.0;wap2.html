			Superfresh on Northern Boulevard is closing. Someone alert Aldi to get them to take over the location!<br />

			If both Walgreens and Superfresh couldn&#039;t make a go of this location, why would Aldi do any better?

			I&#039;ve been expecting Superfresh to close.&nbsp; I visited at least 10 times since they opened.&nbsp; &nbsp;On each visit, there were more employees then customers and this is not an exaggeration.&nbsp; The last visit was this past Sunday.&nbsp;

			A little sad as it&#039;s a wee bit nicer than other stores in the area.&nbsp; Unfortunately, prices were generally higher and I imagine that kept most people away.&nbsp;

			&nbsp;Agree. It&#039;s sad that we can&#039;t have a nicer store to shop in here but the prices were higher and that news went around the community very early on. I believe someone with a more unique product or approach could make a go of it though. The TJ&#039;s in LIC, for example, is pretty busy in a smallish space<br />and I think that could work here.
