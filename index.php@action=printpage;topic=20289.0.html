				Last year I bought my Christmas tree around 81 street. Does anyone know where they will be selling this year and if they&#039;ve started yet?

				We got ours from Food Bazaar. They are all $59.99 flat - no matter the size, but they say all their trees are 6-7 ft. We checked Ultima, but they were a bit too pricey for our budget so we went with FB. It&#039;s a lot less frill, they don&#039;t cut the tree for you, but if you&#039;ve got a saw at home this is pretty easy to do yourself. And you pretty much just pick the tree yourself as well (can&#039;t see it opened or anything), so it&#039;s the luck of the draw. We spent time to inspect each tree in the bunch (as best we could since they&#039;re tied up), but got really lucky and brought home a giant! A bit too big honestly...<br />So far it&#039;s great, hopefully it remains healthy/fresh (can&#039;t speak for the longevity, it&#039;s our first time getting it from Food Bazaar, we got one from the Canadians that set up shop on Northern Blvd last year). If you&#039;re trying to get a large tree on a budget, Food Bazaar is worth checking out. As far as I could tell, other than the service, the trees weren&#039;t that different from the guys outside Ultima.

				We got our tree from the stand on 81st St near the florist. It was supposed to be delivered this evening between 7-9, 10pm at the latest. We haven&#039;t gotten our tree yet! We&#039;ve gotten our tree there for years and have never had a problem. Like dummies, we paid in cash and didn&#039;t get a receipt. It&#039;s only 10:15 so I&#039;m holding out hope that they&#039;re just running behind schedule! <br /><br />I&#039;ll report back with an update. <br /><br />Has anyone else had problems with them this year?

				We got ours from the guys at Ultima but I have to say, they were very pricey this year. We paid $70 for a 6&quot; tree. It&#039;s lovely and I&#039;ve been buying from them for years but I think next year I&#039;ll look for less expensive options.

				Update! We got our tree delivered on Monday. They said that they weren&#039;t able to reach us on Sunday night (not sure what happened, neither of us received a phone call and we were home all night). Anyway, we have the tree, they delivered it, but it was very $$$. We paid $72 for a ~5 foot tree plus a tip for the delivery person. It&#039;s a great looking tree, but very pricey!

				Friday&#039;s edition of Planet Money (NPR show/podcast) https://www.npr.org/2020/12/11/945606413/we-buy-a-lot-of-christmas-trees (https://www.npr.org/2020/12/11/945606413/we-buy-a-lot-of-christmas-trees) covered the high price of Christmas trees this year.&nbsp; The show suggests that demand will be higher this year (covid driving up the desire for trees) and supply is lower (the result of fewer trees being planted/surviving after the 2008 financial crisis).<br />
