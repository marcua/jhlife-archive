					I totally agree. I have written to his office several times about different issues with no response. My email today was to let him know that I will never, ever vote for him again and how disappointed I am in his sleazy turn. My vote was not for a Republican. My feeling is that he feels he can get some help with his legal problems from the Republicans. Probably some kind of deal is in the works. <br />His statement that he is doing this to reform the state government is total crap. The Republicans have been in the majority for so long. Once the Democrats win a majority they want reform. My feeling is they want to keep the status quo. Keep the same crooked politicians in power. Disgusting.

					NYC Native, I admire your optimism and sense of humor. Yeah, letâ€™s get drunk on their expense ?<br /><br />Actually you just confirmed all my impressions. I did not know that the manager was a partner. It makes matters even worse, in my view â€“ less optimistic letâ€™s say.<br /><br />I would never return anything in a restaurant and would not advise you to do that either. We know people who work in restaurants â€“ retuning food in restaurants can be a tricky thing even in a highly regarded establishment.<br /><br />Want to know a funny thing? We felt bad for the waitress and actually left a decent tip. They NEVER charged the tip on the credit card! She, probably, believes that we did not leave it, which just shows how incompetent and screwed up they are.<br /><br />It would be great if they improved but, frankly, we donâ€™t have much faith.<br /><br />

					Thank you for your replies. <br /><br />What amazes me is that, although it is a common knowledge by now that restaurant is a vary difficult cut-throat business, many restaurateurs try to ride on a wave of a short term limited success. Many of them do not develop and support their customer base and lead the venture to an unavoidable failure. Novo, in my opinion, is a startling prove of the above point in all of its incarnations. <br /><br />Despite the fact that locals, including us, are more than eager to support neighborhood businesses, this spot disintegrates time after time. One may argue that this piece of real estate is cursed. I see it as a result of train of owners with myopic outlook. Jackson Heights is ready for big time ventures, especially in the food industry. The population here is getting as cosmopolitan and experienced as anywhere in the world and they have seen practically everything as far as restaurants are concerned. That means that a time is coming when very shrewd businessmen arrive. They will leave Novo and other joints that believe they can get by with a lax attitude in dust.<br /><br />As a matter of fact they already have been loosing huge amounts of money. We go out at least five-six times a months. Minimum three of these times we go to good restaurants. Where do we go? Manhattan, of course. How much do we spend? At least $100 per mouth per visit. This is $600/month! In addition, when we get together with friends, it is much more money. We used to invite friends to Jackson Heights for nights out. Not any longer. We prefer Manhattan or, if we are too lazy â€“ other Queens locations, like Forest Hills or Elmhurst.<br /><br />Also, we are very loyal and understanding customers. If we find a place that treat us well â€“ we spend literally thousands of dollars there over time. We forgive food preparation ups and downs and keep coming. Again, restaurants are not eateries only but places that deliver certain experience as a whole. This is Business 101. For the same token â€“ we practically never come back where our dollar is not appreciated.<br /><br />I strongly believe that there are thousands of JH residents with similar attitude and spending patterns. You do the math.<br /><br />We predicted that the previous Novo would go down (when they started serving undercooked rice). We are pretty sure this oneâ€™s days are almost over. <br /><br />Actually, it is interesting to mention that we kept coming back to the previous Novo at their very bad times and kept paying for their bad food. You know why? Because there was this amazing girl working there as a waitress who was so cheerful, energetic and creative that she alone was able to deliver a great experience in spite all the crap the place going through. She was experimenting with drinks and always asked us to try her new creations. We did and, although not all of them were success stories, she was getting 30% tips in cash. Thatâ€™s the spirit many of us are willing to pay for! <br /><br />

					As far as we remember, this is the second iteration of Novo and, perhaps the worst one. We had a pretty disappointing experience at Novo just recently. <br /><br />Contrary to what some believe the main component of a restaurant is not as much food as the service/experience. We are ready to forgive kitchen glitches if the management makes us feel welcome. Not in Novo though.<br /><br />The centerpiece of bad experience in Novo is the manager (the guy with goatee). If he knows you â€“ he will take care of you. If he doesnâ€™t know you â€“ he will not give ratâ€™s tail. He doesnâ€™t greet you; he never comes to your table to ask how things are. He is useless and does nothing but chats with his buddies at their table or outside. The managerâ€™s lack of awareness of the restaurantâ€™s surroundings is notorious â€“ this is not our first time there.<br /><br />We came for dinner on Friday evening and were â€œgreetedâ€ by a grumpy overworked waitress. Meanwhile the manager was chatting with a group of middle-aged men who we called â€œlocal politicians.â€ Their table was across the bar â€“ so the manager was standing between their table and bar stools. We tried to squeeze in between. Despite a couple of excuse-mes&nbsp; the manager did not bother to move an inch and we had to force our way in. <br /><br />The manager was the worst dressed employee. He was wearing a washed out light blue t-short and looked like he just got out of bed. This signifies to us that he has no desire to represent this place or make it a good place. Or, wait, may be this is exactly what is happening â€“ the place is how he is dressed and how he treats the customers.<br /><br />The waitress was pretty frustrated. She was trying to make the best out of the situation running like crazy while the manager was doing nothing when the place was not ready. On a couple of occasions he tried to give her orders in between chats and sittings at politiciansâ€™ table. We saw how she brushed him off.<br /><br />We think that without the manager the&nbsp; would be much better.<br /><br />Although only three tables were occupied by customers, the empty tables (including the one we were seated at) were only partially ready. Our table had only one glass, paper napkins and knives â€“ as in â€œno forks.â€ Waitress got rid of this trendy bottle of water without even asking what water we would like to drink. She put on another glass and poured tap water in. After awhile she came back and asked if we were ready to order without even asking if we wanted any drinks. <br /><br />Some time later a guy came to set a table next to us. He put forks, knives and cloth napkins as a part of the sets. He offered us napkins but did not offer forks. Even when food came they did not bother to provide forks until we explicitly asked for them.<br /><br />DRINKS<br /><br />We ordered simple martinis and they were not bad. We donâ€™t order their specialty drinks any more because during our previous visits a barman never got it right â€“ either they served wrong drinks or the drinks were lame.<br /><br />FOOD<br /><br />We ordered mixed ceviche and beef carnitas for appetizers. Although the menu stated three kinds of ceviche, waitress said that there were only two. It took quite awhile for the appetizers to arrive. We donâ€™t mind waiting for good food but carnitas came almost cold (perhaps they were sitting in the kitchen for some time), ceviche was a way over salted. I remember their ceviche was pretty good in the beginning. The salt amount throws a flag because the first thought was that it was not fresh.<br /><br />For main course we requested stuffed chicken breast and filet minion au pouvre. Food came just warm. Chicken was rubbery and dry. Filet minion (although ordered as medium) was almost well done, meat was flaky and rough rising questions about freshness and the method of storage. <br /><br />The bill ran to $97 â€“ very expensive for the kind of service and food we have experienced.<br />
