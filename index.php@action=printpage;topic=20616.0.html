				there&#039;s signage up outside the old medical supply store at Roosevelt and 75th, and it&#039;s going to be a restaurant called Gury&#039;s (or maybe Gary&#039;s -- it&#039;s written in script). looks like it could be nice and it&#039;s definitely quite large. they&#039;ve installed porthole windows and replaced or cleaned the brickwork. could be close to opening.

Gury&#039;s is on the main road, so should have no issues attracting customers.

				I feel like by &quot;food court&quot; they probably mean a steam table - not a mixture of tenants. The sign says Bakery and Restaurant.

Elsewhere in the city, I have seen magnificent graffiti art that belongs in a gallery.

				I heard it was same owners as la Abunduncia. This is totally unconfirmed and this is just a message board so i don&#039;t feel so bad spreading hearsay. Can anyone confirm?

				Yes, same owner as La Abundancia across the street. I met the owner - he invited me to hang two of my photos (one in each of the two businesses), as part of my current exhibition &quot;Queens People Eating&quot;.
