				Breaking news on Jackson Heights Life! <br /><br />We&#039;re getting a new eatery on Roosevelt Avenue, called Green Plantains.&nbsp; According to their website (http://www.greenplantains.com/), Green Plantains is &quot;a Nuevo Chino Latino Dining Experience. Our menu features the finest in creative Latin and Caribbean-style cuisine with a touch of Asian influence. Our hearts and souls go into every dish we prepare, and the food we serve reflects the passion and heritage of our Dominican roots.&quot;&nbsp; Sounds very promising.<br /><br />I noticed a new sign for the restaurant today at 79-09 Roosevelt Avenue... it&#039;s not open yet, and there was no indication of when it would open for business.&nbsp; This is the second location for this restaurant... the first location is in Gainesville, Florida.&nbsp; Interesting that they decided to break into the NY market in Jackson Heights... perhaps this is the best way to get noticed among the foodie community.<br />

				There are some reviews on yelp of the original location in Gainesville here http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-plantains-restaurant-gainesville.<br /><br />Four yelp members reviewed it and gave it an average of 4 of 5 stars.&nbsp;

				From reading through the menu, I&#039;m thinking that this may be a chain restaurant similar to the likes of Pollo Tropical?&nbsp; Pollo Tropical, a popular chain also in Florida, has seen additions in Jersey and Brooklyn.&nbsp;

				The Green Plantains space looks finished.&nbsp; They have a menu posted on the window, and a help wanted sign on the door.&nbsp; It seemed there was some sort of new employee traning class going on when I passed by today.

				Breaking News. The place needs loads of improvement. Which means I&#039;ll try it again, despite a first bad experience. Went there for lunch. Extremely disorganized, ending up getting a free lunch, because they took so long, and it was nearing the end of my lunch hour. The staff were very apologetic also, coming to the table many times and asking me and my friends how everything was. <br /><br />The food itself was fair to midling. I got the roasted chicken with green plaintains. Plaintains were good, the chicken might have been good if it was warmer. My lunchmates felt the food was so-so. Interesting that one of their dishes, vegtables and rice, seemed to be done chinese style.&nbsp; The friend that had it, didn&#039;t finish and remarked it was okay;&nbsp; I think she really thought it sucked, but, didn&#039;t want to say that in earshot.&nbsp; There seemed to be a lot of cooks in the kitchen, but, like they didn&#039;t know where anything was or what they had available. My first order, stewed chicken, was cancelled, because they didn&#039;t have it. Mind you, they told me this after 10 minutes. <br /><br /><br />FYI: It&#039;s a Dominican restaurant.

				I ate there yesterday for lunch as well, and I enjoyed my meal as did my dining companions.&nbsp; The staff was extremely nice and attentive.&nbsp; Since they just opened a day or so ago, I think maybe that can account for the disorganization (which I didn&#039;t personally experience).&nbsp; I am glad to have this restaurant in the nabe since it is a bit different then a lot of the other Latin places on Roosevelt.&nbsp; And they say that they are Carribean food with an Asian influence (i think they called it latino chino or something to that effect) which would explain the lo mein and fried rice that is on menu.&nbsp; All in all I liked my experience there and will definitely be eating there again.

				It was almost comical, them running around and trying to figure out how everything worked, until my meal came late. The manager was really a sweetheart. My companions almost didn&#039;t leave a tip and I told them it wasn&#039;t the staff&#039;s fault and they were apologetic in the end.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like I said, I&#039;d go again, once they&#039;re more organized.&nbsp;

				I decided to walk along Roosevelt Ave. today and see what I&#039;ve been missing by never going there.&nbsp; The one thing I haven&#039;t missed is the noisy, noisy 7 train.&nbsp; But there were new businesses to window shop.&nbsp; I actually went in here because it was cute looking and some of their menu photos looked interesting.&nbsp; It was lunch time and the place had no business.&nbsp; I just got a menu cuz I wasn&#039;t hungry.&nbsp; I&#039;m a rib fan so I&#039;ll give them a try.

				My family and I ate here last night.&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, we really liked it, and found it a welcome addition to the current offerings in the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not a full service restaurant, so don&#039;t go in with those expectations.&nbsp; It&#039;s more like Pollo Gus or La Casa del Pollo Peruano (http://lacasadelpolloperuano.com), where food is ordered at the counter.&nbsp; However, at Green Plantains, the staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating of our kids, and did bring the food to us and clear our table when we were done.&nbsp; So the service is sort of a hybrid between a restaurant and a neighborhood semi-fast food place.&nbsp; <br /><br />We tried the mofongo (a tasty mash of yuca and pork, something I&#039;ve never had before), ropa vieja (slow cooked shredded beef), and the bourbon boneless ribs.&nbsp; That last dish was part of a combo platter, which is served in a bento box, in keeping with the restaurant&#039;s Latin-Asian theme.&nbsp; Everything was tasty.&nbsp; Not fine dining, but interesting and satisfying for a fast, casual, and inexpensive meal.

				My husband and I decided to give Green Plantains a try tonight, and we&#039;re glad we did.&nbsp; We ordered the caldo gallego, mojito grilled chicken and ropa vieja.&nbsp; All dishes were good.&nbsp; Todd&#039;s description of the service is on the money.&nbsp; The staff is very friendly and eager to please.&nbsp; I would recommend Green Plantains for those occasions when you&#039;re in the mood for a quick and tasty and reasonably priced meal.&nbsp; Overall, it&#039;s nice to have a place in the neighborhood offering a Caribbean menu.&nbsp; Delivery service will be available soon.<br /><br />After our meal, we had the pleasure of meeting Jimmy, one of the restaurant&#039;s owners.&nbsp; He&#039;s a very attentive and enterprising young man.&nbsp; He explained that his love of Cuban food and Caribbean food in general, garnered from growing up in Florida, is what influences the menu he is offering.&nbsp; His Vietnamese background may explain that Asian flair that is present in some of the dishes.&nbsp; Jimmy further explained that like the Florida location, he would like to build a community oriented customer base in Jackson Heights with the goal of giving back to the neighborhood and its children.&nbsp; In a couple of weeks, they&#039;ll be hosting what he called a &quot;gala event&quot; complete with Latin music and red dragons!&nbsp; Sounds like fun.

				I had the Mojito chicken as well. Is the Jimmy the young man with the muscles, if so, he is really nice. He was the one that offered my meal on the house.

				Kate, it may have been Jimmy.&nbsp; He&#039;ll probably get a kick out of the muscle comment.&nbsp; He said he&#039;s going to check out JHL.

				Just want to point out that the Chicharron de Pollo, although called &quot;chicharron&quot; is not a true crackling in the literal sense of the word.&nbsp; So when ordering, don&#039;t think that you&#039;ll be served something along the lines of chicharron de puerco (pork crackling).&nbsp; Having gone to a few Caribbean restaurants, particularly Dominican and Puerto Rican, when served Chicharron de Pollo, it has always been in the form of deep fried chicken strips or chicken tenders.&nbsp; I assume that when the menu was created, the owners probably decided to just use the English translation of the word chicharron, which is crackling.
