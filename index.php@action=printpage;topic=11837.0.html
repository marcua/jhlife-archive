				So we&#039;ve heard that the owners of Trade Fair probably just changed the name of the place to avoid having to comply with union rules. Hence the ongoing protests. Okay so, I just noticed that a charge we made there (every once in awhile we buy one item there that we cannot get at Foodtown, otherwise we do not shop there--honest!) showed up in my bank account as a charge from Key Foods. So--it really IS owned by Key Foods now? Then why is it identified as &quot;Global Supermarkets&quot;? What the $%^#@ is going on at that place?

				they also recently had a couple of sale signs in the window promoting a sale on frozen food -- &quot;trade fair brand&quot; i&nbsp; still say the same human beings own and operate the place -- i haven&#039;t set foot inside since they screwed all those people over, and i never will, until they settle with unions. but i see the same manager types lurking around the front. <br /><br />and, forgive the unsolicited opinion, but &quot;we do not shop there, honest&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;we shop there, but only when we need something.&quot; you&#039;re not bound to shun the joint, but it is a bit disingenuous to hint that you do.....

				Actually, DSSJH, I don&#039;t forgive the unsolicited opinion.&nbsp; The point I was making had to do with the ownership of the store. We do avoid shopping there nearly 100% of the time, and there IS a difference between spending hundreds of dollars every week (the amount we spend at Foodtown) and on occasion picking something up for 5 or 10 bucks at Global Supermarkets that we happen to need at the last minute, and that Foodtown does not carry. Sorry we&#039;re not perfect--apparently you are.

				Sorry to have touched a nerve. I am far from perfect in life but on union issues i&nbsp; am pretty close. This is more important to me, I guess , and that&#039;s fine. Have a good night <br />&nbsp;
