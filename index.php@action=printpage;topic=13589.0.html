				Today, someone posted about a BBQ at St Marks that would have been a secret to the Jackson Heights Community had not this brave soul let everyone know about this glorious brunch.<br /><br />Keeping up the outings....<br /><br /><strong>What flea markets are coming up.</strong><br /><br />We never hear of <strong>Our Lady of Fatima, Blessesd Sacrament, and other neighborhood churches.</strong>&nbsp; Does anyone know when they will have their flea markets?<br /><br />Please,will you post and let us know...thanks...

				Excellent point. Aside&nbsp; from this venue I did NOT see anything posted. If I had I would have arranged to meet with friends.<br />As far as flea markets wirhin Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and neighboring areas I consider this the responsibility&nbsp; of the actual Flea Market coordinators who sonetimes do very&nbsp; little than collect the fees but no advertising.

				So, so, so, can&#039;t individuals take matters into their own hands and be responsible to let others know when we discover flea markets are scheduled?<br /><br />Are flea markets a secret held only by the coordinators?<br /><br /><strong>Can&#039;t we share about events in the community?<br /></strong><br />Can&#039;t we delight and dance when something where neighbors meet, chat, sell and buy is happening?<br /><br />Sighs<br /><br />

				Not really OT: I haven&#039;t mentioned FM once here, 82oldie.<br /><br />Now I really feel like a slime dog for not posting earlier - and on multiple sites about the Midsummer (it really was close to the the OFFICIAL midsummer food fun)<br /><br />By the way, the food was great.

				Egads, mention them, you raving beauty <strong>Flea markets</strong>, when are they happening?<br /><br />When, dates, locations, etc....<br /><br />Adrianne (sp?)<strong> always</strong> writes about upcoming fleas, what about residents sharing?<br /><br /><strong>Share!!!</strong><br /><br />Well, time to get dressed and go to Espresso 77 for coffee and my morning bagel and lox.

				Thank you very much for your shout out about my regular, ongoing Flea Market postings. As many, many readers of jacksonheightslife.com are aware, I regularly post every Flea Market where I am selling (as well as other events where I am not selling), so I was wondering about the recent posts, stating that there is no information about upcoming Fleas Markets, Street Fairs, et al, in the neighborhood. For everyone out there who is wanting this information, just watch for my ongoing posts, please. FYI, Community United Methodist Church and Jackson Heights Plaza Cooperative Apartments are both hosting Flea Markets on Saturday, August 22nd. I will be posting more August, September, October, November Flea Markets, Street Fairs, et al throughout the season. Adrienne

IN FACT, before this forum I regularly announced flea matkets on Craigslist and then suggested to regular flea market sellers that they use Jsckson Heights Life to get the word out since occasionally buyer traffic was&nbsp; low.&nbsp; Only one, Adrienne,&nbsp; took my advice.<br />This being said, I still believe that Flea Market Coordinators are to make an effort in marketing their flea market. There area few who really make an effort-the flea market on 34th&nbsp; and 77th and most recently, the Madison on 88th and 35th, and&nbsp; Jackson Heights Plaza on 90th and 35th.<br />I personally&nbsp; like it when I see advertising posted beyond 88th street.
