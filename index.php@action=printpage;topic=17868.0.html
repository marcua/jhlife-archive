				Dear neighbors, <br /><br />I am excited to share Addictive 87 is opening in a few weeks! As many of you already know, Addictive 87 was the original Addictive Wine and Tapas Bar. Since we moved AWTB to the front, we have done a few things to the small space; from serving beer and small bites to the popular Vietnamese sandwiches. Well, it&#039;s now officially called <strong>Addictive 87 - Fine Dining</strong>. Over the last few months, we renovated the space, making it more accessible for wheelchairs and seating more comfortable. Addictive 87&#039;s focus is <strong>Fine Dining</strong>. We are excited to bring in an Executive Chef Yamil Sanabia to head the kitchen! Chef Sanabia has years of fine dining experience in Puerto Rico, New York and New Jersey. Most recent, he had worked at Haven Riverfront in Edgewater, NJ. We are super excited he decided to joining us at Addictive! Addictive 87 is focusing on a rotable menus; there will be French, Italian, Argentinean and so on and so forth. Menu will be switched bi-weekly. Official opening day will be announced next week. We hope you are just as excited as we are!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Oh and last night, I created the business card. Hope you like it. We are ready to roll, again! <br /><br />Regards,<br />Patrick
