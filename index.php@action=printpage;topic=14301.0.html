				According to 311 the sidewalks should have been cleared by 11am today. Most notably for me, the sidewalk in front of the Bruson Building, which takes up an entire block, was not cleared AT ALL by 2:45pm on Sunday. Thought about contacting Danny Dromm, then I walked a bit further and noticed that the sidewalk in front of his building wasn&#039;t cleared, either. Where are the property owners? Who can we contact to get this taken care of? One or two storefronts is manageable, an entire block is not.

				I worked my way thru college at a small three-aisle supermarket with only a couple of employees, but the business owner had the intelligence and civic awareness to make sure the street corners were always shoveled and salted so his customers (especially the elderly, often pushing their grannie carts through the snow) could get through. It only makes sense.<br /><br />I also wonder, when a business located in a residential building does not open (for example, on 37th Avenue between 79th and 81st Streets... hint, hint) shouldn&#039;t the building management be responsible for having its maintenance staff clear the sidewalks?

				Walking to the train wasn&#039;t joyous this A.M., but it wasn&#039;t too bad. Sidewalks were mostly cleared on my path, except, of course, for those dreaded corners. You pretty much have to walk in the footsteps of those who came before you to get back on the sidewalk. But it looks like no one stayed home today; the 7 had its usual crowd.

				Give me a break, Eddie. When an entire block on a major pedestrian thoroughfare hasn&#039;t been cleared that&#039;s kind of a big deal. I live on that block. Got to end the of the property line for my building - which my super and his guys have been keeping clear - you&#039;re faced with a mountain of snow and nowhere to go. It&#039;s irresponsible but moreover it&#039;s dangerous.

				I&#039;m going to agree there is no excuse for property owners to let their sidewalks turn to ice. Sure, it&#039;s the second biggest snowfall in NYC history, and we all knew it was coming for at least 5 days. Including tenants and property owners. You don&#039;t get to own property and then ignore the responsibilities that come with it, which includes clearing snow that inconveniently arrives over the weekend. If the property owners don&#039;t like it, they can take it up with Mother Nature.

				If you own a large, block-long commercial building, you get people out there ASAP to start clearing the snow. Just walked by and there are guys shoveling finally. Too bad the owners didn&#039;t spring for a snow blower and get it done yesterday before it compacted. Fwiw, they also still (Monday at 11:30am) haven&#039;t cleared their hydrant and the 74th St side of the building hasn&#039;t been touched. Disgraceful.

				I was really impressed with my section of 73rd street - everyone kept their sidewalks in fantastic condition and the porter in my building was out there multiple times during the storm trying to keep a path clear.&nbsp; Even the Duane Reade on the corner did a slightly better job than usual (they rarely get down to the asphalt so it re-freezes and becomes slippery).

				Well, Captain Flannel, if you had also taken the time to file a complaint yesterday, you would have noticed that 311 wasn&#039;t taking snow removal complaints yesterday. They are today, and I did indeed file a complaint. <br /><br />Again, I&#039;m not complaining about 1-2 storefronts or single family homes. I get it. It takes time to get that done. But the owners of the Bruson Building are negligent here - they want to own that massive building, then they need to pay for maintenance. <br /><br />And property owners have fewer than 24 hours after snow stops falling to clear their sidewalks.<br />http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2489/snow-or-ice-on-sidewalks-report

				And my personal thanks to the man who gave this old lady a hand at the corner of 75th Street by the bus station. 74th Street at Broadway was impossible for me, but at least there was a cleared path around the green-fenced construction site. (Better going than the old driving school, I have to say!)<br /><br />I walked up Roosevelt to 82nd Street to do a couple of errands. It wasn&#039;t too bad, except for a few miserable slush wades. The part of the block with the closed movie theater and surrounding shops appeared untouched, but too early to complain, I gather. <br /><br />Could really use a google satellite or whatever that would give a close-up of the street and crosswalk surfaces for planning!<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve lodged a complaint with 311 for the property that used to house Gothic Cabinet Craft. The 83rd side hasn&#039;t been touched, and I&#039;d Hazard a guess that the business next door shoveled out the space in front along 37th Avenue.

				Sure, it&#039;s a pedestrian city.

				Well, kudos to whoever - 37th Ave between 75th and 89th was good, crosswalks cleared. Of course as the surrounding snow melts they&#039;ll accumulate puddles (already happening), but better than slush, and fingers crossed it won&#039;t get cold enough for them to ice up before the melting (or clearing) process is completed. <br /><br />Haven&#039;t ventured to Roosevelt above 82nd yet, which last year was horrendous when it froze.

				I know this is a bit off topic from snow removal, but I noticed that right after the snow storm there was a noticeable increase in graffiti. I&#039;ve noticed this is the past.&nbsp; Most noticeable to me was on the corner of 82 and 37th where there is that black glass on the side of the vision place. Hope they remove it as well.

				Not a false dichotomy at all, &quot;other cities&quot; (like Toronto) have prioritized the expenditure for trucks that &quot;vacuum&quot; snow up and remove it entirely, rather than attaching plows to sanitation trucks and pushing it to the sides of the road. As it exists now, we have plows. Plows are not going to be able to clean sidewalks and crosswalk cutouts, so either people have to be hired or other equipment (like those little earthlifters) in great numbers. Personally, if there has to be an 82nd Street BID to make sure that it stays clean (among other things), I don&#039;t see how there&#039;s free money lying around that is going to pay for concurrent street and sidewalk cleanings (particularly since much is private property). If you have a cost analysis that shows something different, it would be great to see it.

Or did you miss that in your glee about thinking you could add a douchey request for a cost analysis at the end? It&#039;s absolutely a false dichotomy to suggest the only options are to clear the roads, or to clear the sidewalk cut outs and bus stops. As has been acknowledged previously, it&#039;s entirely possible to do both, but additional resources are necessary. Other cities do it. It&#039;s entirely fair to come to the conclusion that the expenditure on the additional resources - machinery, manpower, etc. - probably isn&#039;t warranted because of the difference in NYC climate to that of say Toronto on Montreal. It&#039;s not a fair suggestion that it&#039;s not possible to have both.

				For context, NYC&#039;s snow removal budget is about $9 per capita per year (http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/washington-dc-new-york-city-blizzard-response).&nbsp; If the political will were there, it would seem a modest expansion of this budget to provide a greater quality of service could be within reach.

Somehow we never hear about cities with solid snow removal plans that include concerns for pedestrians facing a shortage of food because trucks couldn&#039;t get in to the city to deliver food. For all the talk of &quot;Vision Zero,&quot; there&#039;s a chunk of the plan missing when pedestrians have to stand in the street to get on a bus because three days after a blizzard there&#039;s a three foot high wall of snow on the curb placed their by plows, and people are having to leap over, through or walk around (and in to oncoming traffic) puddles approaching the size of one of the Great Lakes.<br /><br />Now, if the city comes to the conclusion that it costs too much money, fine. But that means Vision Zero is BS.
