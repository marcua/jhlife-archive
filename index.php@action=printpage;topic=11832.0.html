				This may be the least interesting public lobbying effort but I&#039;m trying to figure out who I should contact and figure someone on JHL probably knows.<br /><br />I like to walk my dog on 34th and 35th but for reasons that escape me, there is not a single public trash can on any street corner where I can dump a poop bag. Not even near Travers park, where you&#039;d think, as a public space, there would be something. <br /><br />I end up carrying the bag all the way home. My guess is that there would be a lot less dog poop and litter if there were places for people to deposit it. <br /><br />Is this something the JH Beautification Group could do? Is this a Sanitation Dept issue? Local rep? Is there some community resistance to trash cans by the apartments and co-ops on those streets?

				I think this was done on purpose because so many people throw their house trash in those cans and they get filled up in 5 minutes and then there&#039;s trash overflowing onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; That&#039;s why some subway stations no longer have trash cans (which really bugs me). The one on my corner randomly disappears and then shows up again and then disappears again.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure it out!

				I carry my dog poop until I find a can and/or back to my own building. Gerally speaking, side streets have the cans.<br /><br />This is just the way it is, and it will not change, so we must adapt.&nbsp; For me, it&#039;s not a big issue, because I consider it a responsibilty of dog ownership to carry the poop to a proper receptacle, even if I must carry it a few blocks.&nbsp;

I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a solution available that doesn&#039;t involve better policing the illegal conversions.

				This is true. I witnessed may people coming out of buildings and depositing their household garbage on northern blvd. I&#039;ve also seen one business man doing it quite frequently. Some of the buildings have taken it upon themselves to have garbage cans nearby. I do pick up after my dog always but sometimes we go for super long walks and it is annoying to have to carry it around. I would contact dromms office. He is extremely receptive to the neighborhood and its needs.<br /><br /><br />

				The reason for this is that Department of Sanitation cans are only placed on commercial streets, and this is the agencies rules.

				that&#039;s true, eros.<br /><br />when I first moved to the neighborhood in the mid &#039;90s, my ex and I owned one of those Spanish houses on 75th...one with a hydrant in front, which made dumping worse. we asked about getting cans, and the sanitation department sent us a letter saying that city statutes prohibited cans on thoroughfares with no businesses. I guess it makes sense, but sometimes I wish the rule was different<br /><br />but, given the NIMBY attitude of some folks, can you imagine the outcry if a public trash can was placed in front of the building of a particularly vocal one? property values plummeting, the ghetto looming and all that.....

				I really believe most people do the right thing, but it doesn&#039;t take many of the other kind to do some serious damage.....

				&nbsp;Even in the commercial areas trash cans are stolen here frequently. Also used for goals and other sporting<br />props. The illegal apts. garbage is a big problem along Northern Blvd. and have seen them fill quickly with<br />residental trash. It&#039;s not even so much getting the trash cans but the maintenance and theft is a larger issue.<br />A few trash cans disappeared from around 74th street just this week...along with the daffodils that came up<br />after volunteers planted bulbs last fall just to have the flowers cut within the week.
