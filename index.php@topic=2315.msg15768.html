								<div class="inner" id="msg_15768">I was walking along 37th Ave., westbound from 84th Street, with three friends at about 4 am today (Sunday, February 22).&nbsp; A group of men standing outside a bodega started making vile and, of course, homophobic comments in Spanish.&nbsp; After passing them, I turned to one friend and made a comment about safety issues in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Just then, we saw another group beating a person at 82nd Street and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; My friend called the police, who responded immediately.&nbsp; By that time, the group was chasing the victim down 81st Street.&nbsp; I waved down the responding car, and we quickly offered our limited description.&nbsp; After the car continued on, we walked further and encountered what looked to me, at a distance, like a rowdy group at 79th Street.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to take any chances at that point so we turned down 79th toward Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />I usually don&#039;t walk down 37th Ave. at 4 am.&nbsp; Is it like that every weekend after the bars close?<br /><br />Is there someone who has perspective on the crime rate in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; Has it gone up in recent months, or does it just seem like it&#039;s gone up?<br /><br />Finally, is there anything to do to ensure this type of situation is minimized?&nbsp; It is very disconcerting, to say the least.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_15802">I&#039;m not aware of the crime statistics for this area. But as Shelby2 suggests we won&#039;t really be able to determine if there is an upswing crime in the area until we have more data. So we could be at the beginning of a &quot;crime spree&quot; and wont really know it until several weeks in. It&#039;s also important to remember that the statistics that are published refer only to reported crimes. For various reason a lot more crime goes unreported than you would think. <br /><br />That all being said however, I&#039;m more inclined to believe that there has been little change in the crime rate in the area and that there just happens to be more discussion and coverage of crimes here and in the media. The argument that a slumping economy increases crime rates doesn&#039;t really fly with me. Yes more people with less work means more time to get in to trouble. But, as it was mentioned here before most rational human beings would realize that risking imprisonment for $300 from a grocery store checkout counter doesn&#039;t balance. The person who held up Trade Fair didn&#039;t do it because he lost his job, he did it because that IS his job. Good or bad economy he would have committed that crime anyway. He would probably have been better off to commit that crime in a good economy as there would have probably been more money in the drawer <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />. <br /><br />The harassment and beatings on 37th Ave. can also not be blamed on the economy. If we follow the theory that these crimes happen when the bars close then these are people who had money to be out drinking in the first place. I would assume their objective isn&#039;t robbery as much as it is settling a bar fight or some other &quot;beef&quot;. This would also include gang related violence.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the murder of the opera singer&#039;s son, I believe he was involved with selling and or using drugs correct? If I am not mistaken then his murder was a result of being involved in that &quot;community&quot;. Unfortunately in the media rich sound bite world we live in all these separate sorts of crimes and incidents get lumped together and perceived as a spike in crime. Over time the message gets so truncated that it&#039;s very easy to believe that the Streets of JH are teeming with robbers, violent criminals, and axe murderers. This is of course not true.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not defending crime or criminals here, a crime rate of any level is unfortunate and crime for any reason is unacceptable. I am merely pointing out that we have to judge each incident on its own merits and use that information as a community to decide how best to address the problem rather than panicking and blowing the issue out of proportion. <br /><br />The 115 has set up a mobile command center just off Roosevelt Ave. and 83rd St. I suspect his is why their response was so immediate to the assault the occurred on 82nd St. the other night. Perhaps their constant and visible presence on Roosevelt has pushed the criminal element on to 37th Ave. during the wee hours where the police are less visible. Maybe the 115 needs to adjust it&#039;s pattern to now include a regular presence on 37th Ave. during the hours after the bars close.&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_15831">&nbsp;The argument that a significant percentage of crimes committed in JH are committed by immigrants makes sense, but only from a statistical point of view. However, one doesn&#039;t poop where one eats. I doubt that the guy who held up Trade Fair lives around the corner or anywhere near Trade Fair (I&#039;m just using him a an example, I have no idea what his immigration status is). So the theory has to be be expanded to the entire borough, if we acknowledge that 49% of the population of Queens is foreign born then it follows that a significant number of people who commit crimes here are foreign born too.<br /><br />But it still doesn&#039;t make sense that a down turn in the economy forces those who are most affected by it in to a life of crime. Indeed immigrants, particularly the undocumented actually have more to lose than a US citizen. Prosecution and imprisonment are a deterrent enough but for undocumented individuals there is the threat of deportation and a ban on re-entry.&nbsp; For this reason many undocumented immigrants keep a very low profile, even when times are good. Why would they suddenly &quot;blow their cover&quot; for a few hundred dollars ?&nbsp; &nbsp;It would seem that a down turn in the economy in the U.S. would probably force the undocumented population here to go elsewhere for work (ie: Canada) or voluntarily return home, a process I believe which is called reverse immigration. <br /><br />In times of economic trouble immigrants often become the scape goat for a society that needs something to blame other than its self for its problems.Every element of society has a criminal contingency, and unfortunately one bad apple spoils the bunch. Yes there is the selling of fake IDs, prostitution, and other crimes that are prevalent in the immigrant communities in and around Jackson Heights. But I think this is a much smaller percentage of the undocumented population than the media etc. would have us believe. We all tend to focus on the negative a lot more than the positive and talk more about crime and community problems than we do about safety and successes.&nbsp; The attention given to these crimes tends to blow them out of proportion and even if there is a slight uptick in the crime rate it has a way of being amplified to unrealistic proportions. Unfortunately sometimes that amplification is necessary to inspire the powers that be (police, politicians etc.) to take any sort of action. Even more unfortunately, since the community outcry is based on an amplified and faulty perception it is that issue that gets addressed which is very rarely ever the accurate one. So laws get passed and enforcement is enacted on the targeted community and the real problem remains unsolved.<br /><br />A methodic and scientific approach to identifying crimes that are committed and why seems to be a much better way to address the crime issue here in JH or anywhere for that matter. Couple that with increased police presence and some version of a neighborhood watch program and I would think our crime rate would go down. It would be an interesting social experiment to see if closing all the $2 dance clubs has any significant impact on the crime rate. I bet you $2 it wouldn&#039;t, at best I&#039;d venture to guess we&#039;d see a spike in other crimes like prostitution. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

The TF robber does likely live far from the scene of the crime, but crimes that arenâ€™t robberies have a different profile of perpetrator. As causidicus pointed out, I was with him at the time and we witnessed the assault on 37<sup>th</sup> Avenue together. The two men pummeling the third and then taking off after him once he broke away did not appear to be robbing him. (I did not witness his breaking away because I was looking down at my mobile as I rang 911.) Whether or not they actually stumbled out of a bar at 04:00 as we suspected, I assume patrons of local bars often either live in this area or visit it often, a different situation than that of the TF robber. That â€œThe attention given to these crimes tends to blow them out of proportionâ€ is undeniable, but their violent nature and my personal proximity to both of them is certainly unsettling, so I can understand why people amplify them.</div>

However, one doesn&#039;t poop where one eats.<br /><br />But it still doesn&#039;t make sense that a down turn in the economy forces those who are most affected by it in to a life of crime. Indeed immigrants, particularly the undocumented actually have more to lose than a US citizen. Prosecution and imprisonment are a deterrent enough but for undocumented individuals there is the threat of deportation and a ban on re-entry.&nbsp; For this reason many undocumented immigrants keep a very low profile, even when times are good. Why would they suddenly &quot;blow their cover&quot; for a few hundred dollars ?&nbsp; &nbsp;It would seem that a down turn in the economy in the U.S. would probably force the undocumented population here to go elsewhere for work (ie: Canada) or voluntarily return home, a process I believe which is called reverse immigration. <br /><br />In times of economic trouble immigrants often become the scape goat for a society that needs something to blame other than its self for its problems.&nbsp; We all tend to focus on the negative a lot more than the positive and talk more about crime and community problems than we do about safety and successes.<br /><br />A methodic and scientific approach to identifying crimes that are committed and why seems to be a much better way to address the crime issue here in JH or anywhere for that matter. Couple that with increased police presence and some version of a neighborhood watch program and I would think our crime rate would go down.

If you look at the reports given at the Community Board Meetings from the Police Dept., you&#039;ll see this to be the case. However, if you check out the crime statistics on the NYPD website: <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs115pct.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs115pct.pdf</a> you&#039;ll see that overall, crimes have gone down considerably over the last 19years. <br /><br />From personal experience, I have had several encounters with hispanic, machisto a-holes who will hurl homophobic epithets, while I was just minding my own business, trying to get home. Some of these encounters have actually happened in the early evening (6 or 7pm on Northern Blvd. and 37th/79th Street) and once around midnight on Roosevelt at 78th St. I usually just ignore them and continue on my way. So far, I&#039;ve been okay, but I&#039;m always worried that one day I will have to defend myself (one of the reasons I started carrying pepper spray.) I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a lot of it was hate-based, especially with the transsexual and gay community that&#039;s prevalent in JH. I hate to say it, but a majority of the offenders are young, Hispanic males (legal and illegal) who are perpetrating these type of crimes. This is mostly because JH is a mostly hispanic neighborhood and most of the bars on Roosevelt cater to them. <br /><br />As far as the economy relationship goes, any social scientist will tell you that the higher the unemployment, the higher the crime rate. It&#039;s not rocketscience, and people do shit where they eat all the time. Just because they&#039;re criminals, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re intelligent. If you&#039;re not documented and keep a low radar, how the hell are police going to track you down? <br /><br />It would be nice to see something of a Guardian Angels/neighborhood watch program started in JH. Perhaps it&#039;s something that can be brought up at the next Community Board meeting.</div>
