				Does anyone have any recommendations on where I can purchase organic milk cheaply? I hate paying $4-6 for a 1/2 gallon.

				While on the subject of milk, why is Lactaid milk so expensive?&nbsp; I&#039;ve picked it up for $4.99, but am strongly reconsidering purchasing it anymore.&nbsp; Buddy, I remember what you said the other day about switching to organic.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll give that a shot and see how it goes.<br /><br /><em>[Note from Moderator: Moved from &quot;New Vitamin Store&quot; thread]</em>

				Thanks for the positive reinforcement JHICON.&nbsp; My concern is the lactose in the milk.&nbsp; While I understand that organic milk does contain lactose, I&#039;m thinking that maybe it&#039;s something in regular milk that just doesn&#039;t sit right with me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely try it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t usually drink it by the glass...just add it to cereal and coffee.

				Here&#039;s a link from Whole Foods that describes all dairy product.<br /><br />http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/products/grocery/dairyprimer.html<br /><br />Chuckster, organic does taste better and has higher nutrient content (especially omega-3s) than non-organic milk.&nbsp; It&#039;s supposed to have lower levels of pesticides and no antibiotics or Bovine Growth Hormones etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who really knows though.&nbsp; I only know that regular milk has all the above in it and I&#039;d rather not ingest it on a daily basis at least in my own home.&nbsp; But when I&#039;m out, I&#039;ll drink whatever milk is provided.&nbsp;

				Chuckster, be careful. Organic milk is just &#039;clean&#039; regular milk. The lactose problem will still bother you.<br /><br />Organic milk is super-pasteurized and has a very long shelf life. The Nature&#039;s Promise store brand of Stop &amp; Shop is just as good<br />as the others and a little less expensive. However, factor in the gas to get down to S&amp;S and it might be the same as everywhere <br />else.

				Apparently prices on organic milk have been skyrocketing lately.&nbsp; This is from&nbsp; the Times &nbsp;(http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/business/18organic.html?em&amp;ex=1208750400&amp;en=ba057d2a7fc5c539&amp;ei=5087%0A) yesterday (April 18)<br /><br />&quot;Over all, grocery prices have increased about 5 percent over the last year, though some staples like conventional eggs jumped 30 percent and milk, 13 percent, according to the Consumer Price Index. That government index does not break out prices for organic food.<br /><br />Organic manufacturers and retailers said prices began increasing last fall but were only now starting to spike significantly in some parts of the country. Organic milk prices declined slightly last year.<br /><br />Eric Newman, vice president for sales at Organic Valley, a farmersâ€™ cooperative that sells mostly dairy products, said a half gallon of milk cost $3.49, on average, in 2007 while a gallon cost about $6. He said he expected the average price of a half gallon to exceed $4 in the months to come, while a gallon could cost more than $7.&quot;<br /><br />
