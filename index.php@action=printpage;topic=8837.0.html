				Hey everyone - we&#039;re doing Viva la Comida again next week on Friday, Sept 20th. Last year had so much interest that we were able to make it twice as big for this year. That means 82nd Street from Roosevelt to Baxter Ave is closed, as is Ithaca St. To alleviate the lines, we are getting more food trucks and we have more tables, chairs and are adding essentially a 60 foot picnic table. There&#039;s more entertainment and there&#039;s even a tv show filming and giving away food. It&#039;s 2013, and it&#039;s more more more. <br /><br />What&#039;s going on? Viva la Comida is a celebration of food, music, art and the heart of New York City. We have the best-of-the-best food trucks from across the city, highlighted by choice Roosevelt Avenue vendors. Also live music at Dunningham Park and an interactive art space at Ithaca St. At 8pm by the stage, we are holding an open dance competition with trophies and prizes. There is also a pop-up market and the businesses on 82nd Street are offering some of what they do on the sidewalk. <br /><br />You can find out more at vivalacomida.com<br />Invite friends at https://www.facebook.com/events/595799207139049/<br /><br />Pepper me with questions or concerns - I hope you can make it.

				For all you old school Queensies out there, you&#039;ll be happy to know that we have Woodhaven Blvd&#039;s D&#039;Angelo&#039;s Italian Sausage truck in attendance. We&#039;ll be representing 3 great waves of immigration to NYC, it looks like.

				I&#039;m really looking foward to this, thanks Jeff.&nbsp; I was out of town last year so I&#039;m a newbie.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dance competition?&nbsp; Get ready to see my awesome moves.&nbsp; I am a master cabbage patcher.&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; I am a terrible dancer - think Elaine from Seinfeld and you get the picture.

				The Harmonious Belly blog provides a nice recap of the happenings at last Friday&#039;s Viva La Comida! event:<br /><br />Harmonious Belly - Viva La Comida 2013 â€“ Fabulous Food All Around (http://harmoniousbelly.com/2013/09/viva-la-comida-2013-fabulous-food-all-around/)<br /><br />Great job in organizing the event, Jeff.&nbsp; I&#039;d been wanting to try food from Mysttik Masaala, and was able to do so at this year&#039;s festival.&nbsp; Thanks for organizing it!
