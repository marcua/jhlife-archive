			<br />--- Quote from: Bill on December 03, 2021, 07:33:21 PM ---The spread of the Omicron variant only underscores the failure of the major Western countries, the US above all, to develop a strategy for eliminating this deadly virus worldwide. Instead, we are told we must learn to &quot;live with COVID&quot;, i.e., to accept more than 1,000 people, 400,000 a year, dying from it, and no one knows how many contracting long Covid that will potentially affect them for the rest of their lives. If people in our neighborhood are still wearing masks outside, it is because they know so many people who died or were sickened by the virus. Please forgive them for not following your enlightened &quot;science&quot;.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />well said. imagine if we were told we must &quot;learn to live with cancer&quot; ... then again, there are those science-denierrs who claim that doesn&#039;t even exist, so......

			My medico pals are telling me that the initial data is Omicron is more infectious but the disease may be less severe.<br /><br />This is great news. And follows the pattern of how the Spanish Flu of 1918 dissipated.
