					look up &quot;food not bombs&quot; for more info behind the thinking of dumpster diving...zyxy, you should focus on queuing people into WHY the should &quot;dumpster dive&quot; and the sort of impact that activity can have on the community... reclaiming edible food that is destined for the garbage is what NYC&#039;s city harvest program does in order to feed hundreds of hungry new yorkers... dive all you want, but be accountable...

					NO! keep the booze in liquor stores!, consolidation of products and goods leads to homogenization of products line and overall negative impact on the variety of items a community can consume.&nbsp; supermarkets already decide for you what you will eat, lets keep some choice in what we drink<br /><br />

					sadly folks, the situation in JH is bleak and the landlords most of which don&#039;t live the neighborhood at all aren&#039;t helping.&nbsp; much of the square footage available is on building that have been paid YEARS ago, yet landlords are sticking to charging what they believe to be market rates, but in fact are impossible rents for many if not ALL of the business&#039; along 37th Roosevelt and Northern.&nbsp; northern is a little more protected because building ownership is more varied and some of the stores are run by the building owners, but on 37th and Roosevelt entire blocks are owned by single landlords or community trusts.&nbsp; in either case i worry about the resolve and relative deep pockets shops are going to need to stay afloat.&nbsp; in the meantime i encourage everyone to by local as much as possible, as tempting as buying at the large chain stores is, buy local and keep the community thriving... empty shops leads to more despair and greater insecurity.
