			So this is what the NYC DOT has come up with for 34th Avenue as presented to Community Board 3 last Thursday evening. While I don&#039;t love it, I can live with it, which probably means all the car-haters will thoroughly reject this plan.<br /><br />You can read the details and see some diagrams here:<br />https://jacksonheightspost.com/dot-unveils-plan-for-34th-avenue-in-jackson-heights-includes-pedestrian-plazas-and-car-access

			Actually, this is kinda what the DOT is beginning to implement around Union Square.<br /><br />And, well...it sort of works there. And looks pretty cool aesthetically. <br /><br />So even though I would&#039;ve loved a LINEAR PARK...this plan is ok by me. <br /><br />In particular, Travers Park is somewhat expanded for pedestrians...and other areas too...which is great.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I say...HOORAY!

			<br />
			78th Street gets made even more inaccessible. Nice plan. Screwed again.

			Others will be celebrating when a street gets made quieter with less car traffic.<br /><br />Such is the diversity of opinions of humankind. An endlessly rich tapestry.

			<br />
			&nbsp;Hearing about legal requests for buyouts from the city along the lines of what they do when a new school gets built close to someone&#039;s existing home*. Maybe 34th Ave residents can request a legal settlement for the change in circumstances. I imagine some folks are impacted negatively and could receive compensation easily in court, like those losing their garage or business accesses along the avenue. <br /><br />*I think the payouts for recent schools here have been three houses in from the construction sites and some voice on the construction hours, etc. DOT must have something similar?
