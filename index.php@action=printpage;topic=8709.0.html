				The new bakery/cafe El Rico Tinto opened today on 37th Ave.<br /><br />Briefly went in...it seems nice.<br /><br />Bought a spinach baked empanada...(Argentinian style) for $1.50<br /><br />Delicious.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I just finally popped in here for the first time Sunday to try the Empanadas. They had Beef, Chicken, Cheese and &quot;Beef and Potato&quot; (quotes to show that it is not two kinds.. :P).<br /><br />We liked the Cheese the best, had poblano and red pepper I think, was a really nice taste. The next favorite was the Beef and Potato. Followed by Beef and usually I like Chicken the best but it was the laggard in the set. I think it was maybe the chunks of white cheese (I was trying to figure out if it was the white cheese or egg.. I think it was the very mild cheese). Not a huge fan of that substance. Oddly it seemed completely different from the fantastic cheese filling in the cheese empanada. <br /><br />Overall I really liked them and will check back to see what other varieties pop up. Wish they had some spinach when I stopped in. :)

				Big couple of questions about the empanadas-<br />Are they in a sanitary storage place? <br />How do they reheat them? <br /><br />That&#039;s an issue for me lately. One works so hard making a delicious empanada, then keeps it on the shelf (meat, egg, tuna even!!) Then reheat it in a microwave! All the effort of a delicious crust gets sogged down in the reheat, or eaten cold instead.

				I&#039;ve been there twice now, and have been very impressed. The staff is super friendly, and the space is clean, bright, and cheery.<br /><br />I stopped in last night on my way home from work to grab some empanadas to go. I tried the spinach, and they were very good! And Missmarty, to answer your question, they didn&#039;t reheat them. They were stored in a small box (sort of like a toaster oven? Not sure what it&#039;s called) that kept them at a steady, warm temperature.<br /><br />Today hubby and I went in for lunch. You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you, unless you order to go. I tried the veggie burrito, and he got the arepas con chorizo. Both were very good. They also have a pretty extensive juice menu, so we got the pineapple and the passionfruit (marancuya). Refreshing!<br /><br />I think El Rico Tinto could be great for the neighborhood. I hope they do well!

				I&#039;ve had the chicken empanada twice-- it&#039;s my favorite one in the neighborhood now. I don&#039;t think it has cheese in it. It&#039;s onion. It&#039;s moist and has a lovely crust. The spinach one is also good-- that one has cheese, but not overwhelmingly so, and it&#039;s smaller. It&#039;s a bit nutmeggy.&nbsp;

				Never mind the empanadas (which are mighty good).&nbsp; I just came back from a great lunch at El Rico Tinto and everything was great.&nbsp; Starting with a really well-made guacamole (neither as easy nor as common as one would think) followed by a carnitas taco, two chicken chalupas and one of the Columbian breakfast platters with scrambled eggs, sliced chiles, rice, beans an a mini arepa (what can I say--the wife and I were hungry!) What&#039;s more, the place is attractive, comfortable, always has great music and the staff is friendly and willing to recommend favorite dishes from the menu.&nbsp; The bakery items looked great as well but we were much too full at that point.&nbsp; A really great addition to the neighborhood and one which I&#039;ll be visiting often.&nbsp;

				the tacos, for sit down meals, are excellent, especially the fish and shrimp. i like the desserts a lot, but i&#039;m not crazy about the empanadas -- think that mama&#039;s on roosevelt does a better job. i&#039;m hoping to try the dinner platters sometime. they sound good, for sure.

				Finally discovered Rico Tinto--sorry to hear about the &quot;C&quot; rating, because I tend to avoid placed below &quot;B&quot; but will venture into a place if grade is pending--hoping to see improvement.&nbsp; I though Rico Tinto was pretty authentic--particularly enjoyed the chocolate and pan de bono (cheese bread).&nbsp; Visited Colombia this past year--and it was just as good as the ones I had there and better than other places in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Also, liked their mexican breakfast options.&nbsp; Hope to see improved ratings soon... and yes &quot;Tinto&quot; is black usually sweetened coffee that is sold all over streets of Colombia.

				Stopped by Rico Tinto today for breakfast.&nbsp; They&#039;ve long since regained their A rating and I truly believe this is one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It gets most of its attention for its bakery items and coffee and empanadas--all great, by the way--but its shining stars are the items from the full menu.&nbsp; Try the fish tacos.&nbsp; Incredible.&nbsp; Or the guacamole.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; Or, as I did today, the huevos rancheros.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; Great ingredients, beautifully prepared and presented, tasty and even somewhat lighter than other Mexican breakfasts in the area.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been going on and on about this place since they opened but I find that they&#039;re better and better with each visit.&nbsp; Along with Phayul, Ayada, Cositas Ricas and La Fusta, I think this is the best spot around.&nbsp; Also, nice to see Rico Tinto and Arunee paying attention to their decor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems to be paying off in both cases.&nbsp;

				Just here for my periodic rave and ringing endorsement for Rico Tinto.&nbsp; Have been out of town for a while so hadn&#039;t been there lately.&nbsp; But went today for lunch and the place was packed.&nbsp; They&#039;ve rearranged to allow for more seating, especially for groups of 4 and more.&nbsp; And it&#039;s a good thing.&nbsp; The food was, if anything, better than ever.&nbsp; One of the best places in our neighborhood--and really nice besides.&nbsp; Glad to see they&#039;re doing so well.

				Agreed.&nbsp; This place is really outstanding!&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone a couple of times so far--beautiful presentation of the dishes, and everything I&#039;ve ordered so far has been quite tasty.&nbsp; The tortilla soup, with the tortilla strips sticking up like a Frank Gehry building and the soup poured tableside, is a particular fave.&nbsp; And the owners are super nice and friendly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing my best to patronize the place as much as possible, as it&#039;s nice to have a clean, inviting, delicious, and affordable new place in the nayb.
