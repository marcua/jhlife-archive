				The 7 train extension to 34th St. is now scheduled to be open by late summer or early fall.&nbsp; With the 7 terminal station being moved from 42nd to 34th, how do you anticipate this will affect your commute?&nbsp; Is the extension a bonus for anyone living in JH or mainly only the people who will live/work in the Hudson Yards area?<br /><br />(http://galleries.gothamistllc.com/asset/52b4d3c8e0fbc0033a430447/mobile/2013-12-20%2011.18.16.jpg)<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Subway_Extension

				i don&#039;t see a whole lot of benefit for anyone other than those who already work in that area. there&#039;re no trains to transfer to at 11th and 34th, it&#039;s a few blocks south of the live music venues along 11th in the high forties/low fifties and a few blocks north of the art galleries in chelsea. it&#039;s mainly designed to placate the eventual buyers of the seven-eight figure condos that will be built on the hudson yards plot.

				I think it&#039;s mostly for the area residents/workers. I don&#039;t think it will change my commute at all.<br /><br />Although I live closer to the 7 at 82nd than I do 74th Street, I rarely take the 7. I&#039;ve found that it&#039;s usually faster to go to 74th Street and take the express trains into Manhattan. If 74th-Roosevelt ever becomes a 7 Express train stop, that might be helpful for the commute into/out of Manhattan. I&#039;m surprised that it&#039;s not already an express stop, considering that it&#039;s a transit hub for the area.<br /><br /><br />

				Some commuters may experience benefits, others detriments. The reality is that these infrastructure projects are greenlighted based on real estate interests, not on commuter interests. Any benefits for commuters are incidental. Which is not to say these benefits or detriments are not real; they&#039;re just not the point. The same goes for East Side Access, the Second Avenue Line, and the iffy 7 train extension to Secaucus, etc. These projects are pitched to the public as transportation initiatives, but they are at the core real estate projects. We will all find these to either facilitate or burden our trips. And the merits of the actual plans--in terms of long-term, large-scale development and speculation--can be debated. The point is to recognize these projects for what they actually are.

				in a sense, yes, but it does seem to be a bit different these days.<br /><br />having studied NYC history, i think past expansions have been something like you described. this one is more like a developer/developers promising to build huge projects --without paying taxes, of course -- and then leaning on politicians to green light an expansion of the subway. 50-75 years ago, there was more of an organic expansion, this was planned out, signed, sealed and delivered before that tunnel got underway.<br /><br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11421.msg55492.html#msg55492">Quote from: JIF on March 15, 2014, 10:44:10 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A question.&nbsp; Hasn&#039;t that always been the story of subway expansion...for over 100 years now?<br /><br />They built the subway...and then development exploded to where it went.&nbsp; <br /><br />Folks, isn&#039;t our very own Jackson Heights a prime example of that?...According to Daniel Karatzas&#039; book on Jackson Heights...that&#039;s exactly what happened here...(and everywhere else in NYC, no doubt)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				&quot;in a sense, yes, but it does seem to be a bit different these days&quot;.<br /><br />My guess is that it was exactly the same as now... in ye olde days...and that the original real estate developer of Jackson Heights, Edward MacDougall...had strong links to City Hall to influence where the subway went...which is why there is an express stop here...(I believe Karatzas&#039; Jackson Heights book alludes to that between the lines...)<br /><br />

				they&#039;re not closing the 42nd street station, just extending the line to 11th and 34th. there was going to be another station at the midway point, but i guess no developer stepped forward to help &quot;encourage&quot; that.<br />

				I didn&#039;t get that, unless I read something wrong. The terminus of the 7 will be at 34th &amp; 10th, but the 42nd &amp; 7th station will still be there. It just won&#039;t be the last station anymore. <br />

The 42nd St. station will be the 2nd station or the 2nd to last station on the 7 train, depending on which direction the train is travelling.&nbsp; &nbsp;I generally find it relaxing to be able to enter the 7 train in 42nd, be able to get a seat, and be able to wait for the train&#039;s departure inside the train instead of waiting on the platform for the train to arrive.&nbsp; So I guess that won&#039;t be happening anymore at 42nd.

				Its like the west side IRT (1,2,3).&nbsp; It was built before the IND was built, so what would later seem to be a natural place for an express stop (Columbus Circle), its only a local stop.&nbsp; 74th street is the same way.&nbsp; 61st, with the LIRR and its much more built up Woodside, was a more logical choice when the dual contracts subway expansion was planned out.

				Todd, <br />You don’t like the Moscow subways? Only seen pictures and heard accounts from one of my sons, whose been there twice, but they seem quite impressive, even in the nonwealthy districts, the equivalent of JH. Instead here, it looks like the scrimped on the colored glass art artwork we got at 74 Street. It didn’t even fill the entire opening. It’s surrounded with plain glass.
