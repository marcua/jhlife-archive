					I am getting really tired of the attitude in Met Supermarket on 37th/77th.&nbsp; Been going in there for 10 years and there is only one person who appears to be somewhat pleasant - the lady who takes your bags!&nbsp; Cashiers for the most part are surly, mangers or whom I believe to be managers are cocky and arrogant.&nbsp; BUT...what really gets me is when they do not honor what they advertise and stonewall and are damned rude.&nbsp; Case in point&nbsp; try to get the English muffins on sale this week.&nbsp; Circular says buy1 (at an inflated price) and get two free - original, honey wheat, whole grain.&nbsp; They say no it is only for the original.&nbsp; They even ripped the sign down in front of the display.&nbsp; I know it sounds trivial but they have such an attitude and this is not the first time they have done that.&nbsp; Is there any recourse or official place to lodge a complaint.&nbsp; Yep, I am on a soap box now.&nbsp; They got me nuts! Love to start a picket line to call attention to their less than fair practices.&nbsp; At least at Trade Fair if you have a problem they usually resolve it to the customers satisfaction.<br /><br />Anybody else experience similar bad attitude and customer service like this at Met???

					Ok so we have great Indian food and at least 2 million restaurants to choose from, likewise for Mexican....is there a place to get a good hamburger, a nice salad a glass of wine....a place to chill after work or for those nights you just don&#039;t want to cook! &nbsp;If anyone is serious about a restaurant/bistro/osteria/pub &nbsp;please open one.....you will be packed. &nbsp;The misconception that everything in the neighborhood has to cater to a Latino market misses the mark. Latino restaurants are great, but there are many other sorely needed variations aching for a home&nbsp; in Jackson Heights. &nbsp;Whomever opens the first place will make a fortune. &nbsp;If I had the $$ I&#039;d do it in a heart beat.
