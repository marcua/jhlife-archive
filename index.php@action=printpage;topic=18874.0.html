				Dog owners petition for off-leash hours at Travers Park.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Post</strong>:<br /><br />https://jacksonheightspost.com/jackson-heights-dog-group-seeks-off-leash-hours-in-travers-park-starts-petition<br /><br /><em>A Jackson Heights group of dog owners have created a petition calling on the city to allow their pooches to run off-leash during specified hours in a fenced off section of Travers Park. <br /><br />The petition, created four days ago by a community group named The Responsible Dog Owners of Jackson Heights, requests off-leash hours in the newly-remodeled Travers Park, located at 77th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard.<br /><br />The petition, which has generated 215 signatures so far, is addressed to Council Member Danny Dromm and asks for dogs to be allowed to run off-leash in the new fenced in handball court area between 9 p.m. and 10 a.m. each day.</em><br /><br />Click on above link for complete article.<br />

				Ugh. The dreaded “responsible dog owner”. There is no such thing.&nbsp; Even if you think you are picking up your dogs shit, you really aren’t.&nbsp; There still is shit smear left all over. Kids play in that part all the time.&nbsp; These people are disgusting.

				NO. Absolutely NO. There&#039;s a dog run under the BQE just a couple of blocks away. And I too am fed up with the dog poop everywhere around the streets, sidewalks, and front lawns of Jackson Heights.

				Well, on the Travers reconstruction plan, the tennis/handball court area is NOT listed as a dog park. I&#039;m guessing the people protesting on 78th Street on Saturday will also take up this cause.

				the BQE dog run is more than a half mile away, not &quot;a couple blocks,&quot; but i&#039;m also a &quot;no&quot; on this if anyone&#039;s planning to poll the community.

				<strong>This isn&#039;t going anywhere. A response I received from Dromm&#039;s Office:</strong><br /><br />Thank you for writing to our office.&nbsp; We take your concerns seriously.&nbsp; Please know that at present, there are no plans to establish dedicated hours for dogs/dog owners at Travers Park.&nbsp; <br /><br />As you may know, the plans for the Travers Park reconstruction were made years ago in close consultation with the community.&nbsp; Our office held four visioning sessions which provided local residents and community groups an opportunity to weigh in on the plans.&nbsp; These visioning sessions were open to the public and were well attended by hundreds of residents.&nbsp; A dog run was not brought up.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can read a little more about the visioning sessions in these articles from Fall 2013:<br /><br />https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131024/jackson-heights/residents-outline-vision-for-jackson-heights-parks/<br /><br />http://queenstribune.com/community-considers-future-for-green-space/<br /><br />Again, thank you for contacting us.&nbsp; We value your feedback and will keep you updated on any developments.&nbsp;
