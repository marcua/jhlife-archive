				If anyone is interested, please feel free to join the Jackson Heights Discord server. Discord is a chat platform. It&#039;s more akin to the chat rooms of the old days than a forum. It has &quot;servers&quot;, which are like little communities. Inside the servers are &quot;channels&quot; for different topics. For example, we have channels for &quot;general&quot;, &quot;food and drink&quot;, &quot;Meetups&quot;, &quot;parking spaces&quot;, and &quot;rooms for rent&quot;. Discord works in the browser or as a desktop/mobile app. Link to the server: https://discord.gg/YAZt4y8Uhx (https://discord.gg/YAZt4y8Uhx)

				&nbsp;Thanks for making any alternatives to this site. The graphics look kind of light and tweeny. Is that the intended demographic?

				&nbsp;Yeah. We have so many bored tweens here in JH. Some on this board and they&#039;ll like it. Meanwhile Heather Cox Richardson on Substack is a thought provoking read. Nice to be outside the traditional machinery of news and commentary which is something I appreciated from this soon to be gone site.

				This is the first and only forum I have ever been a part of.<br /><br />And as such, I reiterate, that this forum has taught me so much about the inner online thought processes of people, opinions, anger, kindness, group-speak and human flaws. <br /><br />Thank you again to the moderators for this incredible learning curve on online protocol and behavior.<br /><br />I leave the forum far wiser and much more knowledgeable about the online world than when I started. <br /><br />And I take that into the future. <br /><br />Much appreciated!<br /><br />&nbsp;

Maybe we will have a similar good fortune here in Queens? With hyper local news segments and posting for those not device driven. Dare to dream.

These posters should look in the mirror. Their own opinions are equally pablum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Their monotonous negative pablum is being met by similar toned, but contrary and apposite positive pablum. <br /><br />One recurring lesson from the online world...often folks can dish it out...but they sure can&#039;t take it.

				in debates, online or otherwise, people believe they are making statements that are &quot;positive&quot; (or &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;helpful&quot;), and believe the opposing viewpoint is &quot;negative.&quot; it&#039;s a knee-jerk reaction, and it&#039;s human nature, not learned behavior.

				Yes.<br /><br />Positive and negative are relative.<br /><br />And an online environment makes this obvious. (It&#039;s a philosophical discussion. Does absolute truth exist? Probably not. According to Godel, not even in Math.) <br /><br />People online definitely don&#039;t communicate as they do in real life. <br /><br />From Grindr to this forum, the style of communication online is specific to the environment online.<br /><br />People&#039;s character traits, like wanting to correct others, for instance, ...which may be a control issue...do come through of course.<br /><br />But an online environment is certainly a parallel world to reality. <br /><br />Does it have similarities to online gaming...but with words? Maybe. <br /><br />
