				I don&#039;t think crossfit would do well in JH.&nbsp; The one in my old neighborhood in Bklyn charges $300 a month. And they probably pay half the rent that it would cost to open up in JH.

				I always wondered why JH was overlooked by NYSC when they were in full expansion mode (they over-expanded). But maybe we weren&#039;t. The rent is high here. I mentioned the neighborhood to a district manager at Crunch awhile back, but chances are good the only way a Crunch is coming out here is if it were opened as an affiliate by an entrepreneur.<br /><br />The three gym options are Planet Fitness, Blink, and Executive Fitness. Executive fitness offers a couple classes on Saturdays. <br /><br />There&#039;s also Shape Up NYC classes offered at PS 149 (34th &amp; 93rd)&nbsp; https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/recreation/shape-up-nyc. I&#039;m not dying to work out in an unairconditioned elementary school cafeteria during the summer, but it&#039;s fine in cooler weather.<br /><br />OP, I&#039;m also someone who does best with fitness classes rather than motivating myself to get to the gym and do my own workouts. And I also can&#039;t stand running. I do what classes I can in the neighborhood, and I&#039;ve taken to devising my own HIIT workouts for the gym. I had hoped we might get a decent gym in the Bruson Building, but it seems like a gym was not in the cards. :(

				I recently joined Urban Jungle. It&#039;s somewhere in industrial Woodside (which I didn&#039;t know existed until I joined this gym). They have Crossfit, bootcamp, rowing, and kickboxing. My 5x/week class membership is $150/month, which is reasonable considering the small classes and individualized attention. The people who work there are lovely. <br /><br />It&#039;s about a 20 minute walk from JH (coming from 83rd/35th) and parking seems to be easy. <br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />http://www.trainurbanjungle.com/getting-started

				My guess is that there are more large, former industrial-type places to rent in the neighborhoods listed above. You need a decent amount of space for a crossfit gym and then there&#039;s the expense of the potential owner having to get certified to be able to open one. My assumption is that the rent would be exorbitant in JH for the square footage that would be necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My reasons for not being fond of crossfit (for myself - YMMV):<br /><br />1. Because you have to do whatever their workout of the day is - if I&#039;m in the mood for something different then I&#039;m out of luck. You can&#039;t just do your own thing. At least they&#039;ve been changing their workouts at the national level to have better form and less speed of repetitions. (after lots of complaints and injuries). <br /><br />2.&nbsp; I prefer to work out alone. This was the main drawback for me - I don&#039;t want to even make eye contact with other people during my workouts, let alone have to talk to anyone! It&#039;s a negative for me, but I can definitely see how this would be a plus for some. <br /><br />I am fascinated by the crossfit competition documentaries on Netflix (there are two of them from different years). The people at the top-levels are insanely fit and they do nothing but train for the annual &quot;crossfit games&quot;. It&#039;s really becoming a sport in its own right. <br /><br />Edited: I was just looking at the Urban Jungle site and that is a very interesting manner of offering crossfit - I thought that it could only be taught at a &quot;box&quot; (dedicated crossfit gym).&nbsp; The owners get certified to teach crossfit at a weekend training session, which means there are all levels of coach - from crappy to amazing.&nbsp; It seems to me like a place like urban jungle has trainers that are certified in much more than just crossfit coaching, which is a good thing. <br />

				Not in JH, but the Queens public library offers free health and fitness programs, including a CrossFit class in Astoria.&nbsp; Most of the classes are not as intense, and you will have to travel, but the price is right.<br />http://connect.queenslibrary.org/1356?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=carousel&amp;utm_campaign=healthandwellnesspromo_january20 &nbsp;(http://connect.queenslibrary.org/1356?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=carousel&amp;utm_campaign=healthandwellnesspromo_january20)

				I had changed my gyms when I moved to JH from Ditmars, but recently rejoined my old gym since Planet Fitness was just not doing it for me. Coming back, I was struck again by how much I like Matrix on Ditmars and 42 in the Berry Fresh Farm shopping center. Super clean, not too crowded. Classes are included. Not nearly as expensive as the CrossFit places and what I need. If you drive, they have a garage and lot. If you bike or jog, it&#039;s really not that far - the road numbers swap around Hazen and it&#039;s not that long a trip. https://www.matrixfitnessclub.com/ (https://www.matrixfitnessclub.com/)

				Curious why there isn’t a slightly nicer gym already. Clearly blink is doing well. There’s a crowd here that will pay slightly higher prices to get a gym that is less crowded and clean.<br /><br />Currently I just go to blink in Manhattan and bodhi in flushing (weekends). Though club fitness in Astoria will always have a place in my heart.
