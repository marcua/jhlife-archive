				Thank Heaven for the multi-culturalism of the area or I&#039;d still be thinking that McIllehenny&#039;s Tabasco sauce was the only hot sauce around!<br /><br />City Coffee has a green Habanero sauce that would cure ANYTHING! Of course I am a wimp, but willing to learn.<br />Currently I favor Choula. I&#039;m away from the kitchen and can&#039;t read labels, so pardon the spelling.<br /><br />Moderator if you want to start a Hot Sauce is my Friend topic, please do.

				Hi ECG, <br />Great topic! I split this from the other thread as you suggested.<br /><br />My hot sauce of choice at the moment is Sambal Oelek, ground fresh chili paste.&nbsp; The label says it makes &quot;any food mouth-warmingly spicy&quot;.&nbsp; $1.59 for an 8 oz. jar from local stores like Pacific Market.

				Speaking of hot sauce...<br />Has anyone had the hot sauce at La Nueva&#039;s Bakery on 37th Avenue between 86-87th Street?&nbsp; I&#039;ve asked that they think to package and sell it, but the only way I have the opportunity to taste it is while eating one of their delicious spinach empanadas!<br /><br />...Those spinach empanadas really taste great served hot!...and their baked-not fried.<br />:)<br /><br />Wendy

				Tabasco&#039;s chipotle sauce. Just enough heat. Nice smokiness. Made with love by some amazing people on Avery Island. (Nope, it&#039;s not the mass-produced product you might have guessed it is. They may make a lot of it, but Tabasco products are made using the same techniques the small-batch guys employ.)

				Tabasco green is good, but Greg - mind sharing your recipe?<br /><br />I&#039;m still in Scotland. A country that could benefit from hot sauce in its native cooking. Yes I tried haggis. My comment - don&#039;t.<br /><br />However, they have enough of the same restaurants and population distribution that we do that the supermarkets have a nice stock of sauces. Yumm, I think I will go shopping today.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; Well my choice is not so simple.&nbsp; I love FRANK&#039;S RED for marinating my tilipia when making my Baja tacos and it is the perfect dipping sauce for fried chicken. And from the Lone Star state we have the lovely and quite PICANTE CABO hot sauce made with ,habanero peppers the only way to buy this sauce is to make a phone call to CABO restaurant in Houston, Texas and get them to mail it up for you.&nbsp; This sauce is wonderful with eggs (omelets,scrambled), and many Mexican dishes.&nbsp; The clean heat of Thailand&#039;s SRIRACHA chili sauce is the perfect heat for your pad thai, pad khee mao and dipping your spring rolls in but be warned just a dab will do ya!&nbsp; Being a girl from Alabama we always have a place in our hearts and plates for the tried and true TABASCO, this hot sauce is a perfect&nbsp; topping for my gumbo, jambalaya and my all time breakfast favorite <strong>fried fish and grits</strong>!&nbsp; It&#039;s not hard to see that this Southern girl adores her SUPER PICANTE food! ;)

				I am all for Frank&#039;s, Crystals, Red Devil, and the chipotle Tabasco. I&#039;m not so into the regular Tabasco. Not enough tang for me.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t hot sauce at all, but I really like Salsa Lozano.&nbsp; They sell it at Trade Fair sometimes, and I&#039;m a big fan.<br /><br />

				I love hot sauce, but I&#039;ve never fallen in love with any particular one.&nbsp; The only one that stands out for me was a yellow &quot;bonnie pepper&quot; hot sauce like the ones that Buddy recommended.&nbsp; When I was a starving student, I used to eat bonnie pepper sauce on eggs and toast for an exciting meal.<br /><br />These days, my favorites are the hot sauces that come with my take-out meals: Pio Pio&#039;s amazing green sauce, and the fiery homemade sauces served by some of the momo shops.
