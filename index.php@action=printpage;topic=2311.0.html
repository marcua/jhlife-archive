				Wasabi Point Sushi Bar, 76-18 Woodside Ave, Japanese &amp; Asian Fusion.&nbsp; I picked up menu and plan to have lunch this week.&nbsp; They have lunch specials during the week until 4PM ($6.50 &amp; $8.00).&nbsp; Within 2 blocks on Woodside Ave are 4 nice restaurants (2 Thai, 1 Japanese &amp; Asian Fusion &amp; 1 Indonesian).&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the Thai Restaurants (Spicy Shallot) is both Thai &amp; Sushi.&nbsp; This restaurant is popular with the nearby Elmhurst Hospital Employees.&nbsp; They offer lunch for $6.50 in a very pleasant atmosphere.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had two lunches (both Thai) and enjoyed both.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been to Ayada or Upi Java but eventually will visit.&nbsp;

				I like respect both ayada and spicy shallot a lot. ayada would be more adventurous I think... spicy shallot gets busy late at night, which is kind of cool. I think it&#039;s a hip place to go - but not like too hip for you to walk in... <br />Wasabi point is a japanese fusion... although I&#039;m not sure what it is fused with. The owners are Tibetan, but I believe the chefs are japanese. not that that should make a difference, right??? racists. <br /><br />So, I went once to wasabi... had a ramen soup, and it was really good! The fish looks kind of run of the mill plus one, but I have yet to sample it. I would expect it to be better than tomo... but we&#039;ll see. The lunch menu is great. Lots of different options.. and some I haven&#039;t even heard of. I bet there&#039;s a good story with the menu. As for decor - very pretty. it&#039;s sort of like a mirror image of ayada - which I think is just beautiful with it&#039;s colors and heated bench. <br />I def want to go back, but it&#039;s not urgent. I should talk to the chefs next time, not just the owner.
