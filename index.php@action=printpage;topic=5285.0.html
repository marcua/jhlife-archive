				I believe there&#039;s a street fair hosted by the 82nd St. BID on Sunday. But I could be wrong.

				Where do they announce these street fairs? I&#039;ve lived in the neighborhood for over 6 years and have yet to learn of a street fair before it&#039;s actually happening. <br /><br />My apartment faces 82nd street, so it was actually really annoying. It&#039;s nice of the BID to tell the people most inconvenienced by these things.

				I think I know what building you are in we use to live there. There was a stage set up today that was BLARING some music. I didn&#039;t see much except south of roosevelt there were three or four kids play things set up. Perhaps we were there too early??
