				The losing candidate in next Tuesday&#039;s council election needs to hire people with some knowledge of the law -- and some common sense.<br /><br />Three times in the past week, i&#039;ve come home to find campaign signs NAILED to old growth trees on two sides of my building on 35th avenue. putting signs up, even on utility poles, is illegal, but this is downright immoral. and could cause serious damage to the trees. i can&#039;t imagine how anyone would even think of doing this, and, of course, i reported it to 311 (for whatever that&#039;s worth...they did take a complaint, so maybe he&#039;ll at least get slapped with a fine)/

				Factual actions of this campaign:<br /><br />1) Illegal posting of posters<br /><br />2) Distribution of campaign material (while he was not on the primary ballot) on primary day outside polling sites, and inside these sites as well<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -- He was handing out business card sized palm-cards<br /><br />3) His admitted anti-gay sentiments (while I am against same sex marriage, there is no reason to create hatred)<br /><br />4) Mr. Rahman is a registered DEMOCRAT<br /><br />5) NO ONE KNOWS WHO THIS GUY IS

				I met Mr. Rahman the day before the primary election.&nbsp; Very pleasant guy with a great smile.&nbsp; I said, &quot;I&#039;m a Republican and I can&#039;t vote for you but if I need an Attorney I&#039;ll call.&nbsp; He loved it.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know about the nailing of posters on trees which is very disturbing.&nbsp; So I won&#039;t be calling Mr. Rahman.&nbsp;

				I called 311 and filed a complaint&nbsp; with the Dept. of sanitation too. Hopefully they&#039;ll get to the signs, remove them, and fine Rahman&#039;s campaign. <br /><br />Rahman&#039;s campaign is unfathomable to me. What&#039;s scarier is that there is a slim possibility he could actually win. I was floored by the low voter turn out for the primary, and I would expect there will be low turn out for the general as well. It is amazing to see how in some electoral districts such a small number of people get to decide who the representative is for such a large population. In theory if enough people sit back and believe there&#039;s no need for them to vote because Rahman can&#039;t win, he actually could. <br /><br />So please vote tomorrow, I&#039;d hate to wake up on Wednesday morning and find out we lost a potentially great council person and are stuck with four years of someone who has no regard for our community, its trees, or my marriage. <br /><br />

				Indeed he is. Here&#039;s an article about his campaign strategy, seems he took a page out of Sears&#039;s book when it comes to smear tactics.

				The replies on this thread have gone a little far afield from the original topic.&nbsp; But I find the observations about the placement of the ballot proposals interesting.&nbsp; I was unaware there were ballot issues until I noticed them on the ballot.&nbsp; They always seem to be on the lower right.&nbsp; I confess I have missed them in past elections.&nbsp; I guess I learned my lesson and knew to look.<br /><br />There is a lot of political strategy that goes into laying out the ballot.&nbsp; But I think it is a disservice to the electorate the way they always seem to bury the proposals in the lower right.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone is interested, I believe they both were overwhelmingly approved.

				I&#039;m sad those amendments were &quot;overwhelmingly approved&quot; -- now many &quot;non-profits&quot; will suddenly spring up looking for free prison labor.<br /><br />I am also sad that Mr. Rahman got even 24% of the vote. It seems this was as much an advertising blitz for a legal practice as anything else. (I&#039;m assuming that people like that are only tireless advocates when it&#039;s billable.) <br /><br />For me, the awful feeling I got in my stomach when I read about his &quot;strategy&quot; of smear and deception is still there.&nbsp; It would be really great if some follow-up on the institutionalization of homophobic campaign rhetoric in the 25th (and the city more broadly) -- that&#039;s what the &quot;Sears playbook&quot; (and Sears) will be remembered for. It would really be great to snuff out those torches before that malicious flame metastasizes any further.<br /><br />Does anyone know of any writers currently working on something like this? Follow-ups with the principals would have to be a part of any investigative/analytical reporting work.<br /><br />It seems it behooves us as a community to make sure we don&#039;t have to suffer through a replay of this when Mr. Dromm is facing re-election. <br /><br /><br />

				Homophobes and other hate-mongers are not spewing their message in a vacuum.&nbsp; All across the country and the world, they do so because their bigotry and fanaticism find fertile ground in the hearts and minds of a certain percentage of people. Politics is a numbers game and if you can play on the fears of enough people with a program that seems to find a remedy for their problems within the victimization of a certain race, religion, sex, etc., power seekers who have an undeveloped sense of ethics will play that game to their advantage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this type of verbal poison is covered by laws governing free speech.&nbsp; It is indeed the reason why we need such laws.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to defend speech that we agree with - much harder to defend haters.<br /><br />The remedy is education of people so that they are able to see this type of rhetoric for what it is and reject it out of their own innate sense of justice and reason.

				I&#039;m so happy Rahman didn&#039;t win. &nbsp;:laugh: &nbsp;I got a weird phone call the day before and one thing, the lady asked me was about -- what was my religion? &nbsp;Hello! &nbsp;I don&#039;t like it if people judge me because of my religion. &nbsp;:coolsmiley: &nbsp;Thats the reason I did not vote for him. &nbsp;Also because I tried googling him and if he was so serious, then, his work should have been on the internet about how he has contributed for us instead of make money as a businessman. &nbsp;All because you have a business here, doesn&#039;t mean you have great community giving back skills. &nbsp;:D<br />If you look at my old posts, I hate pollution of any kind, e.g., littering and noise. &nbsp;Im not very fond of how the neighborhood has changed especially over the past 5 years with all the illegal vendors, and multiple garbage trucks visiting my streets in the middle of the night waking us up. &nbsp;:o I doubt he had any solutions for this since their party destroyed trees. &nbsp;:tickedoff: That, I am sooooo against.... ( I am one of those people, who have requested multiple of trees to surround 73 street and 72 street). &nbsp;:-\<br /><br />I cant wait until our neighborhood around 74 St. becomes beautiful, clean, and orderly as it once was. &nbsp; :)<br /><br />(By the way I worked for the elections. &nbsp;Some EDs had a greater turn out than others. &nbsp;The one I worked for had a 44% turn out. &nbsp;I did try to tell voters about the proposals on the bottom right had side. They had a leaflet about it too, which I did try to offer when possible.)<br /><br />I wish good luck to our new elected leader Mr.Dromm! &nbsp; :rockon:
