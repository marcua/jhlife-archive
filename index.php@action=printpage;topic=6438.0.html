				I have just come back from a great experience! I took my 3 and 5 year old for a dental check up. We went to Pediatric Dental World in Jackson Heights! Dr. Desiree Laracuente and her staff were totally amazing with my kids!&nbsp; <br />The office is right near Dr. Marino&#039;s office and it is nice and clean with a friendly staff. My kids were all smiles and got through x-rays and exams, cleaning with no problems.&nbsp; I wanted to tell you all what a great dentist Dr. Laracuente is, she went above and beyond all of my expectations and she takes insurance.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is her wbesite<br />http://www.pediatricdentalworldny.com/<br /><br />Pediatric Dental World<br /><br />&nbsp;72-28 Broadway. 2nd Floor<br /><br />Jackson Heights NY 11372<br /><br />718-478-2825<br /><br />She speaks Spanish and English! :)

				Pedodontist is a word that was used for some time to describe the specialty of dentistry devoted to the treatment of children.&nbsp; &quot;Pedia-&quot;or &quot;Pedo&quot; means child or children; &quot;-dontist&quot; denotes one who studies teeth.&nbsp; The old word was found to be confusing.&nbsp; Some people thought it meant foot doctor or something.&nbsp; The modern accepted term these days is Pediatric Dentist or Pediatric Dentistry.&nbsp; The term was changed a few years ago, but you will still hear the older term.&nbsp; Pediatric Dentistry is an age-defined specialty that provides both primary and comprehensive preventive and therapeutic oral health care for infants and children through adolescence, including those with special health care needs.
