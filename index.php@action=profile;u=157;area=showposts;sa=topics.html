					Yelp just posted favorite Queens Dive Bars.&nbsp; Ready Penny gets listed for JHs.&nbsp; I highlighted the closest bars:<br /><br /><br />Starting out in <strong>Sunnyside</strong>, Elizabeth K is stoked over <strong>The Gaslight&#039;s</strong> three drinks for $10 happy hour deal: &quot;Our friends ordered a pizza from down the block, which made it feel more like a gathering in someone&#039;s backyard rather than a night out at the bar.&quot; Out in <strong>Flushing</strong>, &quot;$20 can go a long, long way&quot; at <strong>Cheap Shots,</strong> according to Brittany A, who recommends the &quot;Tequila Slammer, or &#039;XTC&#039;,&quot; one of the many &quot;silly names they have for drinks and shots.&quot; Over in Rockaway Park, Brandon Z checks for quality assurance at Rogers Irish Tavern: &quot;No-nonsense, heavily accented bartender? Check. &#039;No Sniveling&#039; sign? Check. Heck, they even have Anchor Steam on draft.&quot; Fancy (kinda)!<br /><br />Drinking of course leads to drunchies, so though they have an &quot;amazing selection of beers&quot; at <strong>Astoria&#039;s Mad Donkey,</strong> Dena A cautions, &quot;If you have an allergy to peanuts,&quot; be warned â€“ &quot;they&#039;re everywhere!&quot; But if you&#039;re feeling brave, anaphylaxis-prone Yelpers, their bar nachos are &quot;on point.&quot; Konstantin I has found a true dive in Ridgewood&#039;s Caskey&#039;s Tavern, where one can enjoy &quot;microwaveable pizzas and free shuffleboard,&quot; while Elsie W is in a state of confusion at Sheehan&#039;s in Flushing over their 35 cent Jamaican wings: &quot;I don&#039;t understand how we paid $10 for four half-half plates of wings and like 1000 pitchers.&quot; Well, &quot;maybe not 1000, but it was pretty close.&quot;<br /><br />For inebriates those who can&#039;t stop wailing once they&#039;ve had a few, Stephanie S points to the jukebox at <strong>Kelly&#039;s in Astoria</strong>. &quot;It&#039;s got all the staples for a good time drinking: CrÃ¼e, G &#039;n R, and tons of other great rock &#039;n roll bands,&quot; you party animals. Rebecca C prefers the &quot;darts and pool table&quot; at <strong>Jackson Heights&#039; Ready Penny Inn</strong>, a &quot;fantastic dive bar in the middle of Little India,&quot; and Whitestone&#039;s Stone Tavern impressed Alyssa F with their &quot;hightop tables,&quot; multiple TVs, and stand alone shuffleboard: &quot;Me and my friends played for hours!&quot; Bukowski, drink your heart out!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

					Polly&#039;s much loved owner passed away last Fall.&nbsp; She was taken in by neighbors across from where she lived but they have two small, active dogs who hate her.&nbsp; She has been hiding in the upstairs bathroom, alone, since she moved in.&nbsp; I would keep her but I am allergic to cats.&nbsp; I am going to take her until I can find her a home because I can&#039;t stand that she&#039;s been lonely all these months.&nbsp; (Her owner was my friend.)&nbsp; <br /><br />She&#039;s grey and white striped with blue/green eyes.&nbsp; Sweet and playful (she was with her owner).&nbsp; I think now she might need a bit of tender care to be that happy cat again.<br /><br />You can PM here if you are interested.<br />Rose

					I was walking my dog this morning around 7:30am and there was a small terrier mix, golden colored, male dog wearing a little sweater vest that had a red design around his neck. &nbsp;He had a crooked smile/mouth face. &nbsp; At first I thought someone was walking him off leash but then I realized there was no one near by so I quietly called him to come and naturally he started running away.<br /><br />My dog and I walked following him for 4 blocks. &nbsp;I knew if we ran, he would just run faster, but I kept him in sight and kept calling softly. &nbsp;This was on 87th Street right off 34th Avenue. &nbsp;He ran across Northern Blvd. and miraculously didn&#039;t get hit. &nbsp;He ran to 32nd Avenue and I lost sight of him so kept walking towards 86th Street. &nbsp;<br /><br />As I was heading down 86th back towards Northern, I saw him behind a house but there was a locked gate across the driveway. &nbsp;I sat there for awhile and kept my hand thru the gate. &nbsp;He would come close but not close enough for me to grab him. &nbsp;He was afraid. &nbsp;I was so sad. &nbsp;Finally I gave up and headed home.<br /><br />I&#039;m just sharing this for two reasons: maybe someone will recognize the dog&#039;s description and know where he was last seen and also because you&#039;re all animal lovers and I know you will feel my sorrow and that somehow helps.<br /><br />Happy thanksgiving.<br />rose

					My title sounds like a sex ad.&nbsp; Anyway, for those of you who don&#039;t have collars with name tags, two nights ago I came home from work to find my dog sitter waiting for me holding a leash and no dog.&nbsp; I was always told &quot;don&#039;t leave a collar on in the house cuz the dog could get caught and choke&quot;.&nbsp; So I tell my dog sitters to take the collar off in the house.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not any more.<br /><br />My sitter opened her door after speaking to me on the phone.&nbsp; I can only guess that my little dog heard me on the phone, knew it was about time for me to come home and when my sitter opened her front door to go outside and have a smoke, he scooted out like a rocket and ran to my building (which is next door to her house).<br /><br />Since she&#039;s older and moves slowly, she couldn&#039;t catch him.&nbsp; So when I came home from work and realized he was out there without a collar/name tag I freaked.&nbsp; It&#039;s dark out, he&#039;s tiny and black.&nbsp; I thought for sure I&#039;d never see him again.&nbsp; I was distraught.&nbsp; Driving up and down blocks calling his name.&nbsp; Friends in my building walking up and down blocks looking for him.&nbsp; Then I started walking myself.&nbsp; So I&#039;m calling his name, loudly, and asking everyone I pass &quot;did you see a little black dog?&quot;. I walked upto 89th Street and went from 34th Ave. to 37th Ave. and kept walking up and down each block down from there.&nbsp; <br /><br />A miracle:&nbsp; When I got to 85th St., walking on the other side of street, a mother and daughter heard me and waved to me.&nbsp; They found Casey and he was in their apartment.&nbsp; Just a block away.&nbsp; They were walking around looking for anyone who might be looking for a lost dog.<br /><br />So I got him back.&nbsp; Now I tell my sitter: never take his collar/name tag off unless he&#039;s in my apartment for the night.<br /><br />Very scary.&nbsp; I think the odds of him choking from having a collar on are far less then him getting out and getting lost.

					<strong></strong>Jackson Heights Garden Club Fundraiser Sunday Sept 14 5-8pm<strong></strong><br /><br /><br />Its a great party with the proceeds going to the Garden Club for the Purchase of tree surrounds on 37th Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tickets&nbsp; are $55 per person, tax deductible.&nbsp; There will be live music, beer, wine and canapes outside in the garden. Please call 718-476-1911 for more information or questions. Since this is at a private home (period photograph below of house) only 125 tickets will be sold, and adults only please. <br /><br />(I&#039;m posting this for my friends who are hosting the party at their house on 86th Street bet. 34th/35th Avenues. They&#039;ve hosted this fundraiser for past couple years now in their back yard, which is gorgeous, and there&#039;s always a great turn-out.)<br /><br />edited to add: the masthead photo for JHLife is of this house where the fundraiser is being held.&nbsp; AND one of the owners of the house is the guy who considered opening a French Bistro but rents were too high here.&nbsp; So the canapes are yummy.)

					The link below is about a dog in Brooklyn that collapsed from heat stroke.&nbsp; I know most dog owners are aware of what not to do (don&#039;t leave a dog in a car even for a few minutes on a hot day etc.) but I still wanted to share this because of the heat wave and how heart broken I am at the thought of an animal suffering like this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spoken to friends and have decided on very hot days to leave the air conditioner on when my dog is home alone.&nbsp; Something I wasn&#039;t doing because I have fans on but I&#039;d rather spend the extra money knowing that my dog will be safer.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://mcbrooklyn.blogspot.com/2008/07/dog-collapses-from-heat-stroke-on.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://mcbrooklyn.blogspot.com/2008/07/dog-collapses-from-heat-stroke-on.html</a>

					Just wanted to share something silly but new to me: CEILING FANS!!!<br /><br />Growing up here in the North, I was never really exposed to them.&nbsp; But in the past couple of years, I&#039;ve visited friends who have them in their homes and really liked sleeping with them.&nbsp; So I decided to get one for each bedroom.<br /><br />WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE THEY MAKE!&nbsp; WOW!.......<br /><br />Talk about eco-friendly, too!&nbsp; I know there will be nights where I would normally put the A.C. on low that I won&#039;t have to any more.&nbsp; And these fans were not expensive. $80 from Home Depot: Hampton Bay or Hunter.&nbsp; Quiet, no wobble... LOVE!<br /><br />Small things make me happy.&nbsp; &nbsp;:rockon:

					If you could ask your dog ONE QUESTION and get an answer (JUST ONCE), WHAT WOULD YOU ASK?<br /><br />I often wonder what&#039;s going on inside my dog&#039;s brain when he&#039;s staring at me so I&#039;m curious to hear what others say.
