				So you think that the fact that the name of the business is now gone just means they are getting a new sign? I assumed it meant they were closed for good or maybe a new owner was going to renovate and give the place a new name.

				Seems like they renovated just a few years back.&nbsp; They did go overboard with too many tile variations........and the space between the counter and wall was tight.&nbsp; Perhaps they are addressing that?

				Now that I think of it, the deli sign is gone because of some old building violation they got cited for--something about not getting the right kind of sign or permission for a sign or something--several signs were taken down because of that awhile back. Maybe that&#039;s why the Duo Fratelli sign is gone.

				Are far as the signage, they never got approval from the city or landmarks, like several other establishments, which is a violation. If they are redesigning, I hope they create a space for all the illegal motor delivery bikes they use to clog up the side walks. Was never a fan of their pizza but wish them well.

				Yes the delivery vehicles are annoying. I remember when I was shopping for fruit at Growing Farms and I literally could not reach what I wanted because one of their vehicles was parked next to the fruit displays, blocking the way completely.

				Due Fratelli has reopened, with a very stripped down menu&nbsp; -- a few pizzas, a few pastas and a few heroes. It&#039;s a far cry from the voluminous menu they were carrying at the end, and the gentleman i spoke to said that was a conscious decision, since they&#039;d stretched too far and weren&#039;t able to do everything well. will give them a shot, though i always preferred the prepared dishes to the pizza.

				Hmmm...strange move. Maybe their customers mostly just ordered pizza. I&#039;m not a pizza person and I used to get their entrees and salads--but over time decided I preferred other Italian food delivery options in the neighborhood.

				i agree with your assessment, and want to put in a plug for Louie&#039;s pastas/entrees as my top Italian delivery. the chicken with crabmeat dish and the squid ink linguine with seafood are wonderful.

				I found a new takeout menu from Duo Fratelli in our lobby--it is basically the same menu as before with plenty of regular entrees like chicken parm and salads. The limited menu must have been just for the first day or week.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why the poster was told they decided to just serve pizza and heroes. Odd.

				I went yesterday to Due Fratelli and asked the lady working the counter if the ownership had changed and she said no but it was under new management.&nbsp; The shirts the staff wear say Two Brothers on them.&nbsp; Two Brothers own a series of pizzerias in NYC. The staff is all new and they are handing out plain paper take out menus which very limited items on it.&nbsp;

				Hello Jackson Heights <br /><br />My wife Alexandra and I Pedro Mancebo are officially the new owners of Due Fratelli. We Legally had to say new Management until the paper work and DBA officially transferred over. I am more than willing to address any concerns. <br /><br />1- Yes we currently have a stripped menu until the official menu is finalized. <br />2- The menu was reduced because only 45% of the menu sold. The items in the menu are the only items that sold well. My wife and i have years of cooking and management experience and have realized that many people are scared to try different dishes. <br />3- The mopeds parked in front of the store are legally parked. And have to be remain there for charging purposes. However changing the location of the outlets is in the works. <br />4- We reduced the pizza menu because just like a nice car, it is only nice to look at. Countless pizzas although delicious were been thrown away on a daily basis. I in good conscious could not allow the waste to continue.&nbsp; <br />5- We reduced our hours to accommodate the neighborhoods food demand. <br />6- The previous owner was able to stay open so late because the employees were being payed 75 dollars a day versus a legal wage that i now pay. so imagine working a 15 hour shift for 75 dollars a day. <br />7- Many have called the city complaining about the no letter grade posted. The city is currently behind on inspections. The letter legally posted on my window is my &quot;permit application&quot; please if you know who it is, ask them to stop calling the city. <br />8- The building department has been called twice on me. There is no illegal construction taking place. I simply painted, added new tiles, and in increased the size of the customer service area. <br /><br />Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions or complaints that you may have. I will listen to you. If you have time to blog about the store please take time to email me or speak to me. I do not bite. <br /><br />347 513 4577

				Best of luck to you! I am not familiar with what you have retained on your menu, but personally, we used to order chicken parm and salad most often--we are not pizza people except very occasionally. We stopped ordering because we came to dislike the amount of sugar in the tomato sauce--so that&#039;s just our particular taste and dietary needs. Every store on that block seems to have trouble with the DOB and permits and such. I have no idea what that is all about or why there seem to be ancient violations that impede current tenants. Makes no sense. I hope you succeed and keep at least some non-pizza dishes on the menu, like chicken parm or chicken piccata.

				Thanks for coming in here and clearing that up! Now that I know there are new owners, I&#039;ll give you guys another go. I&#039;m sorry people are calling the DOB on you. There are a lot of cranks in this neighborhood—ask someone about the newsstand in front of the supermarket. Oof. Good luck!

				I went to the pizzeria and had a few slices.&nbsp; They were pretty good.&nbsp; I did notice that the customer garbage can was directly under the food display and adjacent to the pizza (preparation) table.&nbsp; I thought that it was pretty darn gross considering that you are placing any old garbage that ends up in the garbage can right where the food is being made and displayed.&nbsp; If you get roaches in that garbage can, they do not have to travel far.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even want to think about rodents.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please rearrange the garbage can location so that it is not so close to the food that is being prepared and/or sold. <br /><br />In any case, good luck!

				Regarding the sign, there is some insane DOB violation having to do with signage that has affected the businesses on that block. The deli took down their sign above the store, and they now have signage on their windows, which must be allowed but not at the top because they don&#039;t have the right permit or something and can&#039;t get it because of some Catch-22 craziness. Likewise, Due Fratelli now just has &quot;Pizza and pasta&quot; or something like that on top, and the name stenciled on the windows? Am I remembering correctly?<br /><br />After I posted my comment about the pasta sauce, the Due Fratelli owner PM&#039;d me offering to customize the sauce for me! The owner said I can just ask when I order and they are happy to alter the ingredients. They are really trying hard, and I will go back--after having stopped patronizing the store a year or so ago.
