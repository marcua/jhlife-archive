I arrived at word and had to double park bc of alternate side parking. At the appropriate time, I went to move my car. The sky was gray, (after the planes hit) and it was raining ash and shreds&nbsp; of paper.&nbsp; As I went to wipe off my car which was covered in ash, I reached down and picked up an American Airline seat number. I placed it back on the ground not realizing the importance it held.&nbsp; To this day I often wonder who sat in that seat.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_88780">Obviously I&#039;m a bit younger than others who have already posted, but I was in my math class (freshman year of high school) when I first started getting a sense that something was going on. The teachers were obviously instructed to continue teaching and keep things as calm and normal as possible. But there were whispers in the class, and I think we eventually confronted the teacher asking her what was going on; especially considering she kept coming in and out of the classroom to talk with people in the hallway. I don&#039;t recall what the conversation was after that, but I remember asking to borrow my friend&#039;s cell phone at lunch to call my dad who told me what was going on. I went home after school and stayed glued to CNN the rest of the day.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_88787">This is a really compelling story from the New Yorker&#039;s February 11, 2002 issue that I just came across yesterday. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/02/11/the-real-heroes-are-dead" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">The New Yorker; The Real Heroes Are Dead: A love story. By James B. Stewart </a><br /><br /><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59092fa1019dfc3494e9c9d5/master/w_1298,c_limit/020211_r10764.jpg" alt="" height="400" class="bbc_img resized" /><br /><br />This guy actually predicted BOTH of the bombings at the WTC, and tried to convince Morgan Stanley to move to NJ before 9/11 due to his feeling that it could get hit by terrorist airplane attack, but the lease was through 2006, so they didn&#039;t move. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Rescorla’s office at Dean Witter was in the World Trade Center. The firm, which merged with Morgan Stanley in 1997, eventually occupied twenty-two floors in the south tower, and several floors in a building nearby. Rescorla’s office was on the forty-fourth floor of the south tower. Because of Hill’s training in counterterrorism, in 1990 Rescorla asked him to come up and take a look at the security situation. “He knew I could be an evil-minded bastard,” Hill recalls. At the World Trade Center, Rescorla asked him a simple question: “How would you take this out?” Hill looked around, and asked to see the basement. They walked down an entrance ramp into a parking garage; there was no visible security, and no one stopped them. “This is a soft touch,” Hill said, pointing to a load-bearing column easily accessible in the middle of the space. “I’d drive a truck full of explosives in here, walk out, and light it off.”<br /><br />As a result of Hill’s observations and his own, Rescorla arranged a meeting with a security official for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which managed the building. “They told Rick to kiss off,” Hill recalled. “They told him, ‘You lease your stories, you worry about that. The rest of the building is not your concern.’ “ (A Port Authority spokesman says that security “took into account all known threats at that time,” and “was better than in most office buildings in New York.”)<br /><br />Less than three years later, on February 26, 1993, a truck bomb exploded in the basement of the World Trade Center. As soon as Rescorla got all of the company’s employees out of the building, he called Hill. “Did you see what happened?” Hill had just seen the footage on TV. “Get your ass up here,” Rescorla said. “I’ll buy your ticket.” Hill flew to New York, and began working as a consultant to Rescorla. He helped Rescorla do an analysis of the security measures at the Trade Center, and commented on drafts. When Rescorla and Hill began their work, no arrests had yet been made, but Rescorla suspected that the bomb had been planted by Muslims, probably Palestinians, or that an Iraqi colonel of engineers might have orchestrated the attack. Hill let his beard grow and visited several mosques in New Jersey, showing up at dawn for morning prayers. He fell into conversation, speaking fluent Arabic, taking an anti-American line and espousing pro-Islamic views. Radical anti-American and militant Islamic views weren’t hard to coax out of his fellow-worshippers. His interviews formed the basis for much of Rescorla’s analysis, which concluded that the attack was likely planned by a radical imam at a mosque in New York or New Jersey. The prediction proved uncannily accurate. Followers of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical Muslim cleric in Brooklyn, were convicted of the bombing.<br /><br />According to Hill, Rescorla concluded that because the World Trade Center was the tallest building in New York, situated at the heart of Wall Street, and a symbol of American economic might, it was likely to remain a target of anti-American militants. At Hill’s urging, he told his superiors that, while the bombing of the Trade Center and numerous other recent acts of Islamic terrorism had been technologically unsophisticated, Muslim terrorists were showing increasing technological and tactical awareness, and were getting better. Hill’s research had uncovered the existence of groups, connected to some of the New Jersey mosques, whose goal was to travel around talking to young people and recruiting the radicals among them.<br /><br />Rescorla and Hill also sketched a scenario of what the next attack might look like. The city targeted might be New York, Washington, or Philadelphia, or even all three. Drawing on his research for the novel on the air-cavalry unit, Rescorla envisioned an air attack on the Twin Towers, probably an air-cargo plane travelling from the Middle East or Europe to Kennedy or Newark airport, loaded with explosives or chemical or biological weapons. Rescorla also discussed his theories with another close friend, Fred McBee, a fellow-writer he’d met at the University of Oklahoma. He told McBee that he’d spoken up at company board meetings about unconventional threats, such as “dirty” bombs, small “artillery nukes,” and anthrax. He followed events in the Middle East closely. “He assumed that it would be the terrorists’ mission to bring the Trade Center down,” McBee said.<br /><br />Rescorla concluded that the company should leave the World Trade Center and build quarters in New Jersey, preferably a three- or four-story complex spread over a large area. He pointed out that many employees already commuted from New Jersey and would welcome the change. He warned that Manhattan’s limited bridge and tunnel connections meant that it could be easily cut off, and transportation and communications disrupted. Moreover, the World Trade Center space was expensive compared with real estate in the suburbs.<br /><br />The World Trade Center lease didn’t expire until 2006, however. Rescorla and his colleagues stayed in Manhattan, and in the meantime Rescorla worked out an evacuation plan for the company’s twenty-two floors. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_88791">I was at work on Canal and Varick, the building shook when the planes hit. I didn&#039;t know what was happening until the second plane hit and we evacuated the building. I saw some horrific things. I was pregnant and all I could think about was finding a safe place. The smell and smoke were overwhelming. I ended up walking home to Queens, over the 59th St bridge, where it seemed like life as usual compared to the chaos of lower Manhattan. <br /><br />It was terrifying. But even worse than the terror of the attacks was not knowing what was going on and not being able to call my husband or family because the phones were out. Lots of rumors on the street about other targets in NY - I heard the UN and Empire State building were targets and many streets were closed. Finally found out about the attack on the Pentagon from a trucker on the street with a radio on. I was on Houston when the first tower fell. Some triangular fighter jets flew overhead and people on the streets screamed and dove under cars thinking it was another attack.<br /><br />Took about 4 hours to get home, streets were filled with evacuees. I walked along First Ave where people were lined up at the hospitals to donate blood and medical personnel were waiting at ER doors for injured people. I think I saw one ambulance.<br /><br />I&#039;ll never forget.<br />&nbsp;</div>
