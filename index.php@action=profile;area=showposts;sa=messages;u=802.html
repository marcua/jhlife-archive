					The most that buyer was willing to do was a sellers concession which maxed out at 6%. Any other deal that artificially inflated price they were not comfortable with from either a legal or from a mortgage payment perspective. We were talking about a ~40K difference in what was offered vs what the board thought it was worth.<br /><br />The board actually changed its mind after I posted this, but it was too late. They completely freaked out those buyers and their rejection was in writing, thus providing them an out of their deposit/contract <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I&#039;m putting it back on the market while I look for a contractor and pursuing all angles. <br /><br />

					I&#039;ve been in contract for 6 months at 3335 81st st (and have already moved out, I have a prior thread from the winter!) and I finally am done trying to plead with the board to approve my sale. People only want to pay 150K for my condition apt, and they won&#039;t approve it unless I sell for 180K (which is the same floor price they gave my better-conditioned upstairs neighbor).<br /><br />My apartment is in old condition all around, 70s kitchen and bathroom, caked on baseboards all around, etc<br /><br />I was wondering what kind of advice I could get on renovations. If I went to a really affordable but savvy contractor and said I only had 20K to work with, would that be enough to raise my value? I would imagine the things included they would have to do is replace tiles/floors bathroom hardware, refinish the tub, replace cabinets and floors in the kitchen (MAYBE one new appliance like stove) and then replace the baseboards and refinish hardware.<br /><br />I renovated less than that in Manhattan in my new apartment for 30K so I&#039;m worried I won&#039;t get far here in Queens, but for my Manhattan apt that required some demo and a full skim-coat (which is super expensive, my new apt could use that but I can&#039;t even go there). But really I would be living paycheck to paycheck if I went any higher!

					Makes sense. The only thing is, I don&#039;t really have the money I think it would require to do so, and I&#039;m strapped with the two mortgages so I would put myself at some financial risk. I could maybe invest 10K total and I think renovations to get it up to the market value they want would be 20-30, or even 40K. It&#039;s also a lot of work getting approvals and such and I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m ready for all that again (I renovated the new apt i bought), unless I can hire someone to help me on those fronts<br /><br />My other plan B would be to rent for 2-5 years and hope to save up enough to do something at the end of that. But I&#039;d be just breaking even or operating at a loss for those 2-5.

					UPDATE. managing agent finally got back to us and said the board thinks my offer is too low. So I have a whole new set of advice to get at this point. <br /><br />I am pretty sure the condition of my apartment and the amount of renovations they want to do, the deal is fair but clearly they don&#039;t want to decrease the value of the units. I would have to get super lucky to find a buyer willing to pay more and can&#039;t really afford to have two mortgages and maintenance for another 6 or more months!

					Thanks for the advice, everyone.<br /><br />What sounds unusual to me is that it isn&#039;t even the application yet and they are holding onto four weeks, but it may be true that my buyer is waiting for the application to be accepted before pursuing the mortgage. <br /><br />I wondered if my attorney could help at all, but also wonder if that will scare them or turn them off. It may be risky for me considering my unit is not in great condition and I may have to sell lower than what they are looking for, which I hope is not the reason everyone is just sitting on it waiting for it to go away.<br /><br />I tracked down a board member thanks to this board and am also going to try to contact her and let her know my situation. I&#039;m sure since she lives close to my unit she would not want me to be forced into a renting situation so maybe she can help from that angle?

					May be a stretch, but I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to sell my unit on 81st St near 34th Ave since last summer. I finally have a buyer anxious to close as we are in contract, but our managing agent who is New Bedford management not only requested a PRE APPROVAL before the actual package could be formed, now they won&#039;t respond to the pre-approval which is simply an offering price, salary, and other very basic info. <br /><br />Apparently my selling broker has been calling every day for weeks and is getting the run around. She called me to see if I can call and get a better response. Do I have any recourse? I can&#039;t afford to pay for two apartments indefinitely. I&#039;m worried something will fall through, then my broker will give up because my building is too tough and I&#039;ll have to start all over again.

					It does have a slight view of the church yard behind my building from the 5th floor, though my windows are fogged up and I think it would require the whole building to replace the windows as opposed to being able to replace individually! It at the very least puts my place at an advantage over the other units for sale in my unit, which also has some on the 82nd street side. <br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about renting too, but going through the co-op board sounds like a hassle and I could only do it for 5 years anyway.&nbsp;

					After 9 years I&#039;m ready to move on from Jackson Heights. I was only 24 when I bought here and over time I&#039;ve realized it&#039;s not right for me, especially as my friends are all moving out of Queens. I have no one to hang out with around here. Not to mention my career has really taken off once I passed 30...I can afford to upgrade!<br /><br />I have this fear that my place will be on the market for a LONG time. I&#039;m on 81st near 34th, across from the gorgeous Towers. Anyone have some advice? I just want out.

					I don&#039;t go to the Met anymore for two reasons: I pass by this area after work, so I usually have my gym bag. I will not check my bag, I don&#039;t have time for that when I just wanna go home. The other reason: their lines are slower.<br /><br />I find the Met to have better looking produce and cleaner, wider aisles, but as surly as Trade Fair can be, it&#039;s much faster and the prices are generally good.

					When I walk by that store, I realize it&#039;s ugly but to me it just embodies how fast this election and campaign had to spring into action. They&#039;re just using what&#039;s there and getting their grunt work done in ugly surroundings to get who they believe in to office and, and not Hiram. It&#039;s inspiring. Once the election is over it&#039;ll be out of their hands until someone takes over that lease and has reason to really invest in making it beautiful for their business&#039; sake.
