					Hey guys <br />For many, many years residents of Jackson Heights have been playing tennis at Travers Park. All are welcome, just bring a racquet and an open mind. All skill levels play here, we all learned one time or another. I&#039;ve been playing for over a month now, during most mornings, it&#039;s a lot of fun, can be competitive and is a good workout. I have seen my progression over the month and I have been getting better day by day! We are a regular group of 10-20 members, ages range from 16-80, all different backgrounds, look for a gentleman named Don Sergio (far right), he&#039;s been playing at this park for 25+ years, used to play with Arthur Ashe. There&#039;s lots of great advice and encouragement. It&#039;s free, fun and great place to make new friends in the neighborhood. My name is Mike, come by and say hi, my yellow lab is usually with me watching us play:)<br /><br />Facebook group: Jackson Heights Tennis Club <br /><br />Group photo taken 11/21<br /><a href="http://s1316.photobucket.com/user/59StudeLark/media/IMG_8857_zpsj0jqdafj.jpg.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1316.photobucket.com/albums/t618/59StudeLark/IMG_8857_zpsj0jqdafj.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a>

					I was at home when I heard what I thought was music coming from a car but then my partner says &quot;There is a marching band marching along 35th Ave&quot; I ran to the window like a giddy teenager to see the amazing sight unfold before my eyes. It was so awesome seeing about 50-100 people marching and playing their instruments tonight. I live on 79/35 5:45pm, anyone know what was going on? I wouldn&#039;t mind this happening more often, it kind of blares out the sound of honking horns:)

					I encountered the strangest thing this morning, I had parked my car last night in front of 78th/35th and noticed this morning that my owners manual and some papers that were in my glove box were now on the front windshield of my car. I opened the door to find that my entire glove box contents and storage areas were all dumped on the floor. The strange part is/was that nothing was taken that i can recall. I had an expensive bike in the back, tennis/golf clubs, ez pass, another set of keys but luckily nothing was taken. There was no forced entry to my car nor was it damaged, I might of left it unlocked by accident...there is a camera from the building pointing in my cars direction or maybe someone scared them off? Who knows, I did not call the police because I am not sure what they could do if nothing was taken...I imagine this happens often if the opportunity presents itself? Baffled to say the least..

					What is going on with the shipping carriers in Jackson Heights. Is anyone else having this issue? I was at my in-laws on 74th st/35th ave and noticed two Amazon prime boxes hanging out in the foyer, one ripped open with an address on it from a couple blocks away. Then when I got home to my place on 79th, I noticed 3 boxes in my foyer which none of them even matching my address at all. I was able to get in touch with one of the boxes owners by the power of looking up there name on social media. The other 2 boxes are still there, what am I supposed to do, does the shipping company come back and re-deliver them to the correct address?

					I need advice on this: So my partner and I are considering leaving time warner after a blissfully long relationship with them. Ugh how will we survive without them? So I heard decent things about RCN and Fios but of course our building is not hard wired to these companies meaning TW has a strong hold grip that we cannot escape! Is this a Jackson Heights thing or a individual building thing? My goal is to eliminate cable altogether, sell my TV/entertainment center (check classifieds section), downsize, get a Smart TV to stream Netflix, etc and hang that TV on the wall for a clutter/cleaner look in our family room. Are there any other companies that anyone uses, my buildings address is 79-06 35th ave. Thanks for any input.

					So, I had two price gouging instances in the same day for me last week. It all started when my partner and I were playing a splendid game of Badminton at Traver&#039;s Park. I noticed a Spanish mom and her kids getting ice cream at the ice cream truck, as I passed us I asked how much, she said $1.50 for a small cone. I said, wow, it&#039;s warm maybe I&#039;ll get one to cool off. I approached the ice cream truck that is usually parked parallel to 34th on 78th where the park starts. The woman (Spanish) instructed me that the small cones were in fact $2.50, I said well you just charged that woman a $1.50, she smirked and said no, no it&#039;s $2.50. I told her that price gouging is not right as I tried to find a license or permit number but I couldn&#039;t find any. Another Spanish gentleman who was walking his dog nearby overheard and said that this happens a lot. Is this illegal? I&#039;m more upset of the fumes that exit the ice cream truck because it idles there for hours but thats another subject...<br /><br />Later in the day we went to go check out Mario&#039;s Pizza (formerly Gustosa&#039;s) to try there slices. My partner has been going to Gustosa&#039;s for the better of 25 years and loved the pizza. We ordered 2 grandma slices, had a nice convo with one of the workers who was making the pie. Then another guy (delivery/counter guy) comes in and stays. We finish eating, ask how much, the original guy murmurs $6 but get&#039;s cut off by the other who says $7. Mind you, this is for 2 slices. A customer prior who ate there twice in the same week noticed that the prices were different in those two times as well as we met outside and talked for a bit. <br /><br />So who knows, but I am sure this goes on a lot or not, anyone have any similar encounters?

					A recent WSJ article said that consumers &quot;rather get there teeth pulled then shop for a new car&quot; It shouldn&#039;t be this way and I can ensure you that it is not this way when dealing with me. So I work for Queensboro Toyota as a independent contractor, yes that&#039;s right by appointment only. We have a large selection of used and certified pre-owned cars/trucks. We also have great 0% financing on Camry, Rav4 and Corolla for qualified buyers. Our dealership is rare in the sense that we do not charge any extra fees of any kind. We sell the car, collect state tax and DMV fees. <br />I have sold many happy Toyota clients within the neighborhood. My approach is calm, collected and honest dealings. If you have a trade in, I can help you sell it privately. I have over 10 years experience. If you are interested or know someone looking for a reliable, safe or hybrid car please call me at 917-504-6950 or email me at <a href="mailto:buyatoyotfromme@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">buyatoyotfromme@gmail.com</a> Thank you.<br /><a href="http://s1316.photobucket.com/user/59StudeLark/media/IMG_3646_zpsol2o4zhb.jpg.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1316.photobucket.com/albums/t618/59StudeLark/IMG_3646_zpsol2o4zhb.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /><a href="http://s1316.photobucket.com/user/59StudeLark/media/IMG_3635_zpse8gooxci.jpg.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1316.photobucket.com/albums/t618/59StudeLark/IMG_3635_zpse8gooxci.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /><a href="http://s1316.photobucket.com/user/59StudeLark/media/IMG_5678_zps4igjlnf1.jpg.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1316.photobucket.com/albums/t618/59StudeLark/IMG_5678_zps4igjlnf1.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a>

					I saw 4-5 police cars stopped by the Coop Apartment building on 75th street between 35&amp;37th ave just now. I only looked out my window because one of the cop cars was double parked for about 15 minutes and buses and cars were honking. I wonder what was going on?

					Hey guys, <br /><br />I have several vintage use bicycles for sale. All bicycles have been completely gone over, taken apart, re-greased and lubed and all have new tires, tubes, brake pads, cables and some have new seats. They only need a rider. <br /><br />Biking is a great alternative to taking the subway or taxi, it&#039;s much cheaper and faster (most of the time) It also adds a health benefit as well as being eco friendly with having a zero carbon footprint on this planet.<br /><br />Also it&#039;s cheaper in the long run so before you think of buying a bike at a big box store (which only lasts a year or two) please check out my bikes which will last much longer! <br /><br />Here is a link to my listing. Thank you<br /><br /><a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/bik/5112459578.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/bik/5112459578.html</a>
