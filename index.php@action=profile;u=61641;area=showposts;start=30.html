Honestly, she and many others made major sacrifices to run. The amount of money it takes alone can crush someone. How do you continue to pay your bills and in other&#039;s case make time for your family while doing all this. It can crush someone. She&#039;s young and set out to do something for the right reasons and now she is living with the consequences of being vilified by the rich and powerful who are manipulating the poor and ignorant. <br /><br />So many people are being elected by dark money because their life is gets subsidized and it allows them to campaign. Ordinary people don&#039;t have that luxury. So ordinary people are not getting into congress. This is a cancer on democracy.<br /><br />Communism isn&#039;t a concern cause, guess what? We are in AMERICA! I think her core message has been that working people deserve equal access to opportunities which will allow them to live with dignity. How could you be against that? <br /><br />I was on the fence during the primary but, voted for her anyway. And the effect she had on a local level was immediate. It freed other politicians to support IDC challengers. And now we have much better local representation because people no longer feared Crowley.<br /><br /><br />

					About a month ago there was a presentation on this at the Synagogue. It was THE Queens presentation, meaning Jackson Heights hosted for the entire borough. The meeting was VERY sparsely attended and kinda sleepy. Suddenly, this guy came in and passed out this &quot;VOTE NO on 2&amp;3&quot; flyer. Then, he started interrupting the people on the panel. He wasn&#039;t even from Queens! He was from Hell&#039;s Kitchen. He ended up leaving before the Q &amp; A. I noticed the flyer had a Union printer seal so, it had to have come from a politicians office.<br /><br />After the meeting, a man who is on the Forest Hills community Board showed me an email form Gale Brewer, sent from her personal account, which parroted the text on the flyer. He then showed me a letter sent out to board members imposing a gag order on these ballot initiatives.<br /><br />Board members are appointed by the borough president. And they don&#039;t want to give up their power. CB3 voted down the Target on 82nd and Melinda Katz still backed it. So, if the concern is about real estate interests being stacked in a largely toothless community board, I would say they are already stacking our local government.<br /><br />A yes on 2 will help people navigate and learn what they need to know to serve on a community board. 2 &amp; 3 work in tandem.<br /><br />On our charter commissions: <br /><br /><a href="http://gothamist.com/2018/10/10/nycs_dueling_charter_revision_commi.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://gothamist.com/2018/10/10/nycs_dueling_charter_revision_commi.php</a><br />

					This guy is part of some inception of the same skinhead crew that murdered Julio Rivera in Jackson Heights.

A simple violent mob mentality. They have always come up with all sorts of stupid justifications for this kind of violence. Be it love of country or pride in your race. All bogus excuses to beat someone up.<br /><br />The proud boys basically represent this without a music scene or even a sports team attached.

					Personally, I&#039;m not really of the mindset that government and politicians are there to fix and provide. Of course they CAN do that but, that&#039;s not actually what the job is per se. So, Im not looking to politicians to help me or my family. But, what I DO expect is that they would have the sense not to undermine the interests of the people in the areas they represent. Please look at the following articles. They are not written by some fringe outlets. They are from a main stream real estate industry magazine. I hope this helps explain more about what&#039;s beneath Crowley affable and friendly exterior.<br /><br /><a href="https://therealdeal.com/2016/01/07/right-before-firpta-reform-a-surge-in-real-estate-donations-to-rep-joe-crowley/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://therealdeal.com/2016/01/07/right-before-firpta-reform-a-surge-in-real-estate-donations-to-rep-joe-crowley/</a><br />This legislation enabled the kind of foreign money laundering the Trump org is infamous for. And it&#039;s killing our city.<br /><br /><a href="https://therealdeal.com/2018/01/31/steve-roth-apparently-supported-trumps-decision-to-back-out-of-gateway-funding-plan-report/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://therealdeal.com/2018/01/31/steve-roth-apparently-supported-trumps-decision-to-back-out-of-gateway-funding-plan-report/</a><br /><br />Taking money from people who supported backing out of the gateway tunnel DOES NOT help New York City. This has been in the news again. It&#039;s thought that this tunnel is actually in very dire need of repair and should it collapse one day it could cause major physical harm to people and it would also have a big impact on the cities economy.<br /><br />Also, if you can stomach it, here is Trump bringing up LeFrak and Roth on stage to speak. <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwBkRr4UlpY" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwBkRr4UlpY</a><br /><br />So, again, please tell me how Crowley can stand up to Trump when his donors are pals with Trump?<br /><br />Ask yourself who has Crowley&#039;s ear, the good folks of Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, Corona and LeFrak City. <br />Or Richard LeFrak and Steve Roth.

Crowley&#039;s voting record in congress was OK. But, locally the people he has supported over the years allowed for the piece meal sale of the boro, pushing the kind of LIC style development further and further into Queens. Empty condos that hide foreign money resulting in less affordability for middle and low income New Yorkers.<br /><br />He did not take a stand against Peralta. He stood by him. So, that is an indication of what kind of moral compass he has. He&#039;s an affable guy. That&#039;s what an effective politician is. It&#039;s just about what kind of impression an individual is left with not what they actually go and do.

					Seems like Crowley has something in mind for the future. This article speculates that our district could be redrawn and he may be considering a comeback under its new boundaries. If that&#039;s true, Crowley has shown himself to be another craven politician who refuses to accept reality. He lost and then his slate of candidates lost in the state primary. This guy just can&#039;t accept the facts....<br /><br /><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/politics/contributions-dated-2022-may-give-clue-crowleys-future" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.crainsnewyork.com/politics/contributions-dated-2022-may-give-clue-crowleys-future</a>

The National Review is a conservative publication, and attacking clean energy fits their political agenda.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />That may be so, but it&#039;s also important to consider the entire life cycle of a product or system before deciding it is clean.&nbsp; Or clean enough because nothing is going to be a panacea.&nbsp; It&#039;s not an issue right now because there aren&#039;t enough panels hitting end of life yet but that will drastically change in around 15 years when the wave of panels installed in the last decade start reaching their end of life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Currently most discarded panels end up in landfill.&nbsp; Some are recycled, but there is no regulatory requirement to do so.&nbsp; Unfortunately there isn&#039;t much incentive for voluntary recycling because the breakdown products are not very valuable.&nbsp; Depending on the cell type this can be 76%-89% glass, 7%-8% aluminum, 4-10% polymer, 5% silicon for silicon cells, and very small amounts of silver, tin, lead, copper, indium, gallium, selenium, nickel, zinc, and cadmium.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If we&#039;re going to embrace solar I also think we have to demand regulation for the disposal of the panels and make sure we have adequate recycling facilities in place or planned/in construction.&nbsp; This has already happened in the EU.<br /><br />These facts are apolitical.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I agree with all that. And this is part of how it will grow an economy and create new jobs. Not just focusing on manufacturing and installation but, maybe also with end of life recycling.<br /><br />The problem I have with the national review is that they look to crap on any ideas of alternatives to fossil fuels. They are not scientists or leaders of industry, not even legitimate journalists. Just more pundits paid off to parrot talking points that were handed to them. And more often than not, steer the conversation back to the old polluting sources of fuel.<br /><br />One of the larger groups that represents coal reacted to the IPCC report from last week by saying we should rely more in carbon capturing technology. This does not yet exist in a larger commercial capacity. And this is the same industry that recently successfully lobbied our government to peel back regulation regarding mercury in our air because THAT technology (already widely available) was &quot;too expensive&quot;.<br /><br />Coal can be utilized in the extraction of REE (rare earth elements) metals that we need for renewable energy and technology in general. At the moment China has a near global monopoly on these.

					Sorry just wanted to add that the National Review article posted sited a study by a group called Environmental Progress founded by &quot;Pro Nuclear&quot; Michael Shellenberger. He advocates for the continued use of nuclear energy. And his books have been criticized by the Sierra Club. Nuclear is yet another failing poison industry lobbying the government for a bailout to keep it afloat.

Maybe you think that wind power is bad too because it kills birds. The number two story on National Review is called &quot;Doubling Down on Global-Warming Alarmism&#039;&#039; written by Neo-con Jonathan Tobin.<br /><br />There is NOTHING political about this. Everyone lives on this planet. All sides of the political spectrum should care. If you are a republican you should be concerned that the US&#039;s GDP will take a substantial hit from the effects of climate change. The only reason any GOP politicians combat this is because they are bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry.<br /><br />If you hate Socialism, then lets end these programs that prop up coal and let the market decide. Green Energy is a job creator. <br /><br />

					I received a notice about a Bronx based community solar project. I&#039;m already signed up. In light of this week&#039;s grim warning from the UN this is great timing for something like this.<br /><br /><a href="https://cleanchoiceenergy.com/news/Enrollment%20Launched%20for%20Bronx%20Community%20Solar/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://cleanchoiceenergy.com/news/Enrollment%20Launched%20for%20Bronx%20Community%20Solar/</a><br /><br />NY State is actually one of the best places for renewable energy policy because we have the ability to elect which source of energy we want to use through Con Ed. If you don&#039;t make the choice yourself then, they choose whatever for you. <br /><br />I made the switch about two years ago and my bill has actually gone down right afterwards. I liked Clean Choice because their CEO seems like a righteous guy who was involved in Moveon.org. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/business/energy-environment/applying-the-lessons-of-politics-to-green-power.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/business/energy-environment/applying-the-lessons-of-politics-to-green-power.html</a><br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/tommatzzie?lang=en" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/tommatzzie?lang=en</a><br /><br />Other options are Green Mountain Energy but, they are owned by NRG which still uses fossil fuels.
