				The fact that there are really no really nice cafe or restaurants in the neighborhood is seriously making me consider that a move to JH would not be best for me.&nbsp; No offense, but all of the restaurants that people seem to rant and rave about are have no ambiance.&nbsp; Am I missing something?&nbsp; My husband and I have been heading out to the neighborhood for months now making sure we like more than just the amazing apartments.&nbsp; With the exception of the Nepalese restaurant on 37th Ave. and Jahn&#039;s, we have not been too impressed.&nbsp; I guess I should also say that my husband and I look forward to going out to dinner every Friday night and then for brunch on Saturday.&nbsp; This is what we do which is why we were attracted to JH, not to mention the awesome spaces!&nbsp; There appear to be no brunch spots, let alone a nice french cafe with some atmosphere.&nbsp; If I am wrong, which I hope I am, someone please tell me.&nbsp; Also, I am a vegetarian, so that is an issue too.&nbsp; As an example, we went to a restaurant on 37th and 83rd and every single thing had meat; the salad, the potato knish and even the pasta (which was ordered with just red sauce) had a weird hunk of meat hidden at the bottom.&nbsp; Also, the majority of the places on Roosevelt Ave look scary.&nbsp; Where should we be going?&nbsp; We are going to try Novo tonight although it has mixed reviews.&nbsp; Thanks so much!

				Delhi Heights (Indian) has a nice ambiance and lots of vegetarian options.&nbsp; Same with Arunee Thai.&nbsp; I&#039;m vegetarian too and while I&#039;d love a little organic hippie restaurant in the area, I don&#039;t mind traveling for it and I get by pretty well on what we have.&nbsp; For a little French type cafe like what you are describing, I&#039;d check out La Flor in Woodside.&nbsp; It is a 15 min walk or a few stops on the 7 train away.&nbsp; Brunch places don&#039;t really exist in the Heights (as far as I can tell), but we have some KILLER diners...

				The restaurants in JH are short on ambiance but what the area lacks in ambience is made up for in low prices for good ethnic cuisine.&nbsp; If you are looking to go out locally to the kind of cute, cozy places that are plentiful in the LES, then JH probably isn&#039;t the right place for you.&nbsp; But if you are up for local culinary adventures and saving some money (and going into Manhattan when you need a seriously cozy place full of ambience) then maybe JH will work out for you.<br /><br />I just had dinner tonight at La Cabana Argentinian on Northern Blvd-- my first time.&nbsp; I thought it was very cozy and sweet, with the doors opened to the sidewalk.&nbsp; We had a half pitcher of sangria, the brick oven roasted pizza and some pasta.&nbsp; however, it&#039;s still not the LES and you have to be willing to embrace the difference.

				I moved here from the UWS a year ago and faced the same issues as you (the restaurants are lacking ambiance and most are mediocre at best).&nbsp; HOWEVER, there are a few very fine places here to recommend--Uncle Peter&#039;s Continental and Trieste are lovely spots with great food.&nbsp; Second La Cabana.&nbsp; There&#039;s also La Pequina (a pretty spot for Columbian food).&nbsp; And a short walk will take you to the best Thai place on the East Coast--Sriphapai and walk a bit farther where you&#039;ll discover Saphori D&#039;Ishia for fine Italian food in a grocery store setting. And there&#039;s Park Side in Cornona...When it comes to fine dining, Jackson Heights is not Manhattan but you&#039;ll find a handful of worthy restaurants to keep you satisfied.

				Agree about lack of ambience here in JH. &nbsp; <br /><br />Astoria &nbsp;or LIC is a short drive or subway ride away where there is great ambience, outdoor dining and brunch.<br />Good thing about JH is the cheap ethnic eats...and Indian food is great for vegetarians. &nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, the latino places are meat-centric. &nbsp;When I order the pasta with Pesto -- I tell them to hold the meat at one of my favorite restaurants Chivito D&#039;Oro. <br />I doubt you were being served a &quot;potato knish&quot; in JH -- I think it must have been a beef empanada.<br /><br />As far as ambience in JH -- Urubamba and Las Margaritas are nice on 37th. &nbsp;Agree with Delhi Heights for Indian. Rice Thai on Roosevelt has a Manhattan look.<br />On Northern Blvd. Pio Pio and Jardi&#039;s have ambience.<br /><br />Canelle&#039;s for coffee and French pastires is great in the ugly shopping center by Walsbaum&#039;s. <br />La Flor cafe is nice as well -- but you would have to run to get there in 15 minutes. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Easy to adjust to dining in JH and shouldn&#039;t stop you from moving to the &#039;hood - hopefully a good brunch spot and outdoor seating will come soon.

				There are lots of thai places in the neighborhood. This is probably ground zero for thai in NYC, maybe america? I&#039;m not sure. <br />They are vegetarian friendly and some very pretty. other than what&#039;s posted -- ayada and nusara in elmhurst are pretty and very good.<br /><br />Jahns? eh, I much prefer Jackson House a few blocks east. although it&#039;s hard to see with the huge tree in front of it. That is a diner, but the best traditional one in the neighborhood in my opinion.<br /><br />French - I&#039;d love to see one too, but it&#039;s not happening. yet. there aren&#039;t any french people. (oh, Canelles! Excellent french bakery. by anyone&#039;s standards.)<br /><br />Maybe you should get acquainted with Astoria. Many of my favorite restaurants are there and, to me, it seems like the standards are higher. we have a ton of restaurants, and some can be hit or miss. but in Astoria most are major hits. maybe it&#039;s just me... <br /><br />Moving to JH, you should look for jackson heights and not UES.

				i&#039;d strongly, vociferously stand up for the food quality in JH -- thai, south asian, mexican -- but since the OP initially asked for ambiance, how about:<br /><br />Trieste on Northern Blvd. Charming intimate spot with good Italian and a nice selection of Istrian specialties.<br /><br />Novo on 37th Ave. Not spectacular, but very nice for a glass of wine and tapas<br /><br />Cafe Salamanca on Northern Blvd. Old school spanish, long on charm. <br /><br />La Terrazza on 41st ave (i think). great setting, friendly place for a drink.<br /><br />La Portena on 37th ave. be careful to be specific about no meat in pastas that look to be meatless, though!

				I question the Jahn&#039;s ambiance comment. I think there are numerous places in JH that have the same ambiance as Jahn&#039;s, and that&#039;s not saying much.<br /><br />I really like Delhi Palace. The staff is super nice, unlike the staff at the &quot;other&quot; Indian place. <br />Novo has nice food, but the decor has something to be desired.<br />La Portena was delightfully surprising the one time I&#039;ve been there. The steak was excellent and the Argentinian cowboy decor was very interesting.<br />I like Sabay Thai and the Korean restaurant across the street as well.<br />Rice Avenue has a good hip vibe as well.<br /><br />Fortunately, JH is just a short subway ride away from Astoria and Forest Hills. it&#039;s easy to get to a little more ambiance with a metrocard and not have to head to the crowds of&nbsp; SoHo or Tribeca.

				I&#039;m a big fan of brunch, and slightly crushed that no one in the neighborhood has one. However, brunch is one thing that I&#039;m willing to travel- near and far- for. Dim Sum in Flushing, Sparrow or Bistro 33 in Astoria, or Dillinger&#039;s in Woodside- off the top of my head- are all very good and not a far trip (though, admittedly, Astoria is easier if you have a car). Lots of my friends live in Astoria or Brooklyn, and when I meet them for brunch, we usually meet in Manhattan because it&#039;s more central (though I have yet to meet anyone who isn&#039;t willing to come to Flushing for Dim Sum at the hint we might be going out, though, of course, harder- impossible?- to navigate if you&#039;re a vegetarian who doesn&#039;t speak Chinese). Cassidy&#039;s, a bar on 31st Avenue (near Canelle- delicious, and cute, though not intimate) used to have a small brunch, but I&#039;m not sure if they still do. It&#039;s a bit of a hike, but it&#039;s not a horrible walk, and there&#039;s a bus that heads up that way.<br /><br />The ambiance of most places doesn&#039;t bother me- when I go to a hole in the wall, I don&#039;t expect much, and the &quot;nicer&quot; restaurants I think are generally cute- Himalayan Yak just got a nice makeover (is that the Nepalese place you mentioned in your post?), but most of the places are, for lack of a better word, &quot;ethnically&quot; decorated rather than trendy and sleek, but I don&#039;t think that makes them any less cute, and most certainly doesn&#039;t hurt the food!<br />

				The restaurants on Roosevelt are essentially what you&#039;d expect to find underneath subway tracks. There are some great places (Tacqueria Coatzingo for Mexican, El Sitio for Cuban, Rice Ave. for Thai). But with the exception of Rice Ave. the decor is lacking. There&#039;s a great place on 83rd St. just on the Elmhurst side of the tracks called El Meson Colombiano. It&#039;s a quaint little restaurant with an owner who might just sit down at your table and order for you. I&#039;ve had some fabulous meals there. Armondo&#039;s on 37th Ave. at 75th St. has good Italian food, a good vibe and really attentive service. Urubamba on 37th Ave. at 86th St. looks like a really cozy place for Peruvian food, though I&#039;ve never been. I can&#039;t speak to the vegetarian options, but there&#039;s a nice brunch spot in Astoria called Cafe Bar. It&#039;s located at 34th Ave. and 36th St. not too far from the Steinway stop. There are no brunch spots in Jackson Heights as far as I know. But that will change if the neighborhood continues to change. Happy eating.

				I gotta say, this is a great thread.&nbsp; My partner and I just moved here and are excited to try all the options you have all listed- ambience or not.&nbsp; So far we have tried Dosa Place on 73rd, excellent, and very kind owner, Thai Son which is actually Vietnamese, also very good, La Portena, where we have gone a few times before we moved here, and a Korean place whose name escapes me --they grill the meat on wood charcoal.&nbsp; Lots of fun.&nbsp; Keep your favorites coming!

				delhi palace has the worst service ever. i recall at least two occasions when the people i was dining with and i had to remind the wait staff multiple (like 5x) times to give us our check. they were also slow to refill our water glasses as well. i am going to stand by delhi heights for its ambience, great service, and yummy food. i haven&#039;t been to jackson diner in at least a year so i&#039;m not sure what it&#039;s like these days, but the food was always good, though not great. ambience is obviously lacking there (cafeteria style set up). i still need to get my butt to mehfil. and i&#039;ve had take out from deshi biryani, which was really flavorful. the decor from the outside looks nice and homey. i also like rice ave. for ambience and food. some might say armando&#039;s is good for ambience (if you like the sort of old world style), though i haven&#039;t been there in years because it&#039;s simply overpriced for the neighborhood. what about tibetan yak? it looks cute from the outside and i&#039;ve also heard good things about the food (if you know how and what to order). <br /><br />no, there are no super cutesy cafes or bistros here (yet?), but that&#039;s not to say we don&#039;t have a lot of good options.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure you are going to find the ambiance you desire-but the choices available are incredible.&nbsp; Last week we decided to try a new place and went to Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House @ 86-08 Whitney Ave.&nbsp; The place is very small, only two tables, and a counter running around the room with stools.&nbsp; The entire experience was fantastic.&nbsp; We ordered one of the fried dumplings (4), one order of steamed dumplings (8), and a bowl of soup with hand pulled noodles and pork.&nbsp; With two cans of soda the total was $10.&nbsp; Unbeatable and we sat and ate there and had a culinary experience that I would not trade.&nbsp; During our time there we saw dozens of people stop in and pick up food to go.&nbsp; We will be back on a regular basis.&nbsp; After moving here a year ago, weâ€™ve had many friends from NYC come and visit â€“we typically have drinks at home, then walk to the restaurant, after the meal we walk back home a different route and sometimes have dessert there.&nbsp; <br /><br />For ambiance we love Urubamba, Delhi Heights, Delhi Palace, &amp; Thai Son.&nbsp; We also like the newly renovated Tacqueria Coatzingo â€“but itâ€™s bright &amp; noisy.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I am&nbsp; a foodie and I agree that J Hts Cafes with ambience&nbsp; are few and far between.SOMEONE OPEN ONE!!!!!!PLEASE, OR HOW ABOUT A WINE BAR...&nbsp; Jardi ( tapas bar) on Norther 86/87 is very good and nice atmosphere,&nbsp; La Flor on Roosevelt /54th is great food and cutesy, Sripaphai ( the best Thai outside of Bangkok, I know I lived there!) on 65th/39th Ave off Roosevelt is great. Just tried Uncle Peters on Northern and 83rd (I think) nice atmosphere huge portions.&nbsp; Pio Pio on Northern is great decor and roast chicken.&nbsp; For the vegetarians there salad is enormous and filled with avocado and various veggies. Limoncello on 82/83rd and Baxter off Roosevelt is good food but decor looks like someone&#039;s took the drapes from someone&#039;s living room.&nbsp; Owner is charming though and the food is good. I guess Novo is the hippest ( if you can believe it)&nbsp; place in the neighborhood. They had a trio last night and the food is decent.&nbsp; It has a bar where you can get a drink and finally they stop the incessant meringue music.&nbsp; Okay someone&nbsp; listen up - French Bisto, Mediterranean Osteria, a Pannini, Salad &amp; Pasta Restaurant, A pub with a decent hamburger......it&#039;s time......

				I&#039;ve never had bad service at Delhi Palace. I really like the place, but we mostly order take out. I completely agree with Jimbo&#039;s call for a nice wine bar, a place with a rear garden cafe. Something nice. Jardi is nice, but it feels so far away.

				salmanca is very old school. reminiscent, to me, of the classic spanish restaurants in the west village. rustic, warm, welcoming. food is good and solid. it will not blow you away&nbsp; on any level. but for shrimp in green sauce, chorizo dishes and seafood/riice items, you&#039;ll do well. a good sangria too.

				We went to Urubamba for Father&#039;s Day dinner on Sunday. It was excellent. For those who don&#039;t know, it&#039;s located at the corner of 37th Avenue and 86th (or 87th?) Street. It&#039;s Peruvian, the atmosphere was very nice. My wife thought the dishes were too salty, but I disagreed. The only down side was that it took a long time to get our food, granted they looked extremely busy for a Sunday evening. The appetizer sampler plate was excellent. It had fried calamari, ceviche, a chicken tamale and beef/olive/cilantro stuffed potatoes. My wife had the paella, which she said was very good. I had the Skirt Steak (enormous) with rice and Peruvian beans. Also very good.<br /><br />We also had a pitcher of the Peruvian spiced punch. Also excellent.<br /><br />The ambiance was the best I&#039;ve experienced, next to Jardi, in the neighborhood so far.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I hope the slow service was just a fluke. I&#039;ll be back here for sure.
