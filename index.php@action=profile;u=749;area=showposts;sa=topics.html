					Not sure if this belongs in restaurants or general discussion..&nbsp; considering that we’ve all survived the pandemic so far, and seen some restaurants create multiple variations on the outdoor curbside dining pavilions.. some good looking, others bare-bones.&nbsp; But we are here now.&nbsp; <br />There are some places that seem to have given-up, and their outdoor area is a $*ithole.&nbsp; Examples?&nbsp; <br />1) Rainbowberry on the corner of 80th St &amp; 37th Ave.&nbsp; there is no place to sit, and the plywood creation is a dilapidated mess.&nbsp; This needs to be dismantled and removed.&nbsp; If only for the removal of visual clutter &amp; a parking space. <br />2) Samudra restaurant.&nbsp; It appears they created a space using pallets, and then it looks like a car/truck smashed into it and destroyed it.&nbsp; - Whatever, it is now a pile of rubble that needs to be removed ASAP..&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

Here, at the end of the day, we are the ones suffering,&quot;said Chen. <br />Earlier in the week, the mayor promised the city would do “whatever it takes” to break up such encampments, but Elmhurst business owners said they have seen none of that enforcement.<br />“We cannot do anything. We call and nobody can help us. We want to survive. Right now, not too much business. That is why we need the help,&quot; said Yokehong Ooi, the manager at Pulau Pinang, a local restaurant.<br />One employee said a local nonprofit has been coming three times a day and providing water and food for the unsheltered individuals, and even dropped off tents to provide shade and covering during rain.<br />“There are toilets in the back. They don’t want to leave. There is more and more coming,” added Phuiman Lo, a waitress at Pulau Pinang.<br />They say they&#039;ve been fined because of the unintended consequences of the encampment.<br />“We have gotten tickets because it is too dirty. But it is not our fault. We have garbagemen come everyday, but it is them who throw the garbage to us in the back and we get tickets for them,&quot; said Lo.<br />The Department of Homeless Services said when a condition on the street needs to be addressed their office acts as quickly as they can.<br />The department stressed that it engages and works to build trust with the unsheltered individuals and offers them services, but added that results take time and do not happen overnight.

					EARLY VOTING.&nbsp; I received a mailer from The Board of Elections.&nbsp; It has a notice on it that says “New Yorkers can Vote Early or on Election Day!” <br />In opening the mailer, it lists 3 ways to vote: <br />1) Vote early at your assigned early voting poll site (mine is NY Hall of Science @ 4701 111th St, Corona)<br />2) Vote on Election Day ay your poll site, <br />3) or vote by absentee ballot if you qualify. <br /><br />The early voting starts 10/26 - 11/3.&nbsp; <br />FINALLY!<br />

					Hi Everyone, when we have food delivered, I always give the delivery person a nice tip, because they are providing me a service and they often work in even the worst weather.&nbsp; <br />But sometimes I call the restaurant just before leaving work in Manhattan, and ask to have to it ready at a certain time.&nbsp; Then I simply stop by and pay + pick it up.&nbsp; <br />Is a tip expected -when picking up food?&nbsp; I would be curious to hear what people think. <br />

					EJ’s Barber Shop opened in early November, and it’s run by Ernesto who previously worked (cut hair) at Modern Barber on 77th st. <br />It’s great to see a young hard working guy open his own shop!&nbsp;

					Last night I heard sirens, and today 37th ave was basically closed to traffic from 76th – 79th streets.&nbsp; <br /><br />There’s a 99 cent store on 37th near 77th street, next to the laundromat or chicken place – and there was a lot of smoke coming from the roof.&nbsp; Not sure where the fire actually was, but there were at least 5 firetrucks and a lot of people standing around.&nbsp; <br />After I walked past, I could smell the smoke, as the wind was blowing West.<br />
