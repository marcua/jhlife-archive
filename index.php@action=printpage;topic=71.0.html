				Who has got the best pizza in Jackson Heights?<br /><br />I like Thomas&#039; on 37th between 83rd &amp; 84th but mostly since it is around the corner from my apartment. So I was wondering what places people here like.

				I&#039;ve always loved Pizza Boy, on the corner of 74th Street and 37th Avenue (opposite Commerce Bank). I&#039;ve been going there since the mid 1970s... but Tomas b/w 83rd and 84th on 37th Ave. is excellent as well. The styles are just very different, so try both.

				I don&#039;t live very close to Gianni&#039;s, but it&#039;s still my top choice for delivery.&nbsp; Especially when they have whole wheat crust.<br /><br />But I like Peppino&#039;s for slices since I pass by there much more frequently.&nbsp; They have a wonderful sfingione, if onions are your thing.&nbsp; (The owner has suggested that I try it topped with anchovies, but I haven&#039;t tried that yet!)<br /><br />Elmhurst Famous is also delicious, but sometimes it&#039;s a bit too salty for my taste (not that it stops me!).

				Good pizza in JH?&nbsp; You gotta be kiddin.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />I would say back in the 80s there were several good pizzerias in the neigborhood. I would go to Woodside instead and go to Donatos on 39th ave and 55th street

				Another thumb&#039;s up for Gianni&#039;s pizza on Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Their menu says they&#039;ve been in business since the 80s, but it&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve tried their pizza.&nbsp; We tried the whole wheat pie tonight, and it was very good.<br /><br />I also recommend the brick oven pizza at La Cabana, also on Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Although they&#039;re a full fledged sit-down type of restaurant, I believe they also take orders for delivery and take-out.

				I also tried Gianni&#039;s pizza for the first time about a week or so ago.&nbsp; So far it&#039;s my favorite pizza I&#039;ve had in JH but I&#039;ve only tried a few places on 37th Ave.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t as impressed with the minstrone soup, but mainly because it was too broth-y for me and I prefer more substance.&nbsp; It did taste very &#039;home-made&#039; however.

				I go to Porto Bello in Astoria on Ditmars (43-18 Ditmars Blvd).&nbsp; Fantastic pizza.&nbsp; They also have whole wheat crust pizza if you like that.&nbsp; Also their food is really good and not expensive.&nbsp; Plus there&#039;s two parking lots: outside and underground FREE.<br /><br />So worth the ride.

				I used to be a devoted fan of Rosa&#039;s in the strip mall on 75th and 31st near Modells, but something has just been wrong with everything I&#039;ve ordered there lately (soggy crusts, flavorless pizza, etc.).&nbsp; So on another board someone recommended the Pepino&#039;s in woodside, and i noticed that they took over the old Thomas&#039;s Pizzeria on 37th ave and 76th across the street from Met.&nbsp; Their grandma slice is out of this world - oven roasted sauce, crisp yet fluffy crust, caramelized onions, it&#039;s amazing.&nbsp; I&#039;d highly recommend it to everyone in the nabe.

				hi buddy - I admit I&#039;m lazy when it comes to picking up a slice and I&#039;d usually just walk a block to Pizza Boy, but Pepino&#039;s is <strong>that</strong> good that I&#039;ll go out of my way another two blocks.&nbsp; I&#039;d also love to try out the brick oven place because when I lived in Astoria I was at Sac&#039;s all the time for their brick oven.&nbsp; If you try it please let us all know if it&#039;s any good.

				If you like Singa&#039;s, there&#039;s a branch called Elmhurst Famous on 37th Ave between 75th and 76th that sells the same exact pizza.&nbsp; I think one of them branched off from the other.&nbsp; I like their fresh tomato pie the best!&nbsp; Their Indo-Pak Special pizza isn&#039;t that bad either.

				Since I&#039;ve already confessed my pizza addiction, I wanted to add that I finally had a pie from La Cabana (Argentinean/Italian restaurant.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; I got the plain margarita pie.&nbsp; Next time I&#039;ll ask them to cook it longer so the crust is more browned but it was tasty.&nbsp; So La Cabana is a thumbs up for both their steaks and pies. And I like that they play music but not so loud that you can talk.&nbsp; Pepinos has a better selection of pies but La Cabana has a really nice ambience. It&#039;s definitely worth a visit.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I thoroughly enjoy Peppino&#039;s and Gianni (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=938.0)&#039;s (the two local places I order from the most).<br /><br />But I agree with Spanishfish, Lombardi&#039;s is on a different level.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good, traditional pizza place (not one of those silly &quot;gourmet&quot; places like Una Pizza Napoletana in the East Village) that uses excellent ingredients and a very hot oven.<br /><br />The two places that I&#039;ve heard people rave about most are Grimaldi&#039;s (http://www.grimaldis.com/) and Di Fara (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=483.0) in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Tragically, I&#039;ve never had a chance to try them.&nbsp; Among the places I have tried, my favorite is Totonno&#039;s (http://www.totonnos.com/MenuHome.html) at Coney Island.&nbsp; Closer by, Nick&#039;s (http://queens.about.com/cs/restaurantreviews/gr/rr_nicks.htm) in Forest Hills is also very good.&nbsp; <br /><br />For more on pizza-y goodness, check out Slice (http://slice.seriouseats.com/).

				Walk into a room full of 100 native new yorkers and ask where to get the best pizza or bagels or burger, and you are sure to get 100 unique answers to each questions. So I humbly give my opinion. Gustosa&#039;s is the best new york pizza in Jackson Heights.<br />Since moving to Jackson Heights I have been to 3 pizzerias:<br />Famous Pizza: you can have whatever you want as a topping on these custom-made pizzas, but the crust has the consistency of wet cardboard. Plus, be prepared to wait 15 or 20 minutes for your pie. I don&#039;t know what this is, but it&#039;s not NYC pizza.<br />Peppino&#039;s: the crust is ok but the cheese is too greasy. If you&#039;re eating a Peppinos slice you better have some napkins nearby because there is going to be some grease running out the back of the slice and onto your hands or your lap. Beware the large inventory of pizza with different toppings they have sitting on the counter. The only way they can have that kind of inventory is by putting it in the refrigerator at night. They don&#039;t have much pizza with vegetables and seem to have focused on pizzas meat toppings. They don&#039;t even display their plain slice. They have it under the counter and you can ask for it. Is it so much to ask for a simple pizza with broccoli or spinach?<br /><strong>Gustosa&#039;</strong>s: a crispy doughy crust, an even distribution of sauce and cheese, and the cheese is not very greasy. Every time I have been there, I have been served by the old italian guy who is clearly the owner. They have very little inventory because they clearly make their pizza fresh as it is needed, and I think their strategy is more focused on vegetable slices, and if you want meat they start with a plain slice and add whatever you want. At $2 for a plain slice, i think Gustosas is a great value and probably the best in Jackson Heights.<br />

				I love Tommys, my family has been going there for many years, way before I was born. I find that Pizza Sam on northern is delicious when they deliver, but if you go inside their customer service is horrible. I waited about an hour once for one pie. I was young so I didnt speak up but they did not make it as soon as I ordered it, and the place was empty. My sister has gone in on a separate occasion and was also given gruff service. Maybe they were just having bad days but its enough to turn me off. Tommy&#039;s gets my vote! <br /><br />BTW can you all believe the price on pizza lately? Now its a real treat for me, instead of a quick, cheap bite. Oh well... :P

				I&#039;ve tried Due Fratelli/Peppinos, Gustosa, Gianni, Rosa&#039;s (in East Elmhurst), and Thomas and hands down THOMAS takes the cake.&nbsp; They have pretty good grandmas and very good cheese slices! And this is coming from the biggest pizza snob of all! I&#039;m happy I discovered Thomas because I was going to Peppinos, which was ok before switching ownership, but now they turn their ovens up so high that the cheese doesn&#039;t melt properly (it&#039;s kind of rubbery) and whenever I&#039;ve gotten one of their spinach rolls, despite having them warmed it up right there in the oven, the inside is always raw!&nbsp; (For spinach rolls though, Gustosa kills it!&nbsp; They&#039;re sooo good!)

				It may not be the best pizza in JH&#039;s but Due Fratelli (across from the MET Supermarket) just introduced a late night special between 10PM &amp; 1AM.&nbsp; A slice of pizza is $1.25.&nbsp; At this price, it will improve the taste of the pizza.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bargain for those out late at night.&nbsp;

				Personally, I don&#039;t think any deal makes that pizza worth it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think I&#039;d even bother if they were giving it out for free.&nbsp; I&#039;m not exaggerating when I say it&#039;s the worst pizza I&#039;ve ever had.

				I like Gustosa&#039;s too, and the guy, for a solid slice. What&#039;s the name of the Indian Fusion pizza place? Never tried it but heard it&#039;s great.

				Definitely not for the pizza traditionalist, but how different can cone shaped pizza really be?&nbsp; <strong>Grub Street</strong> received a tip that Astorias, Rio Bonito Brazilian supermarket has recently started serving cone pizza.&nbsp; And I thought adding pineapple to pizza was a bit unusual.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; <br /><br />Brazilian Pizza in a Cone Comes to Queens (http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2009/08/pizza_in_a_cone_spotted_in_que.html)

				I should be moving to the area from Morris Park in the Bronx in a few weeks, and good pizza is the one thing I&#039;ll miss the most. Right now I can walk in any direction and find solid pizza within just a few blocks. Classic Sicilian? Sorrento&#039;s. Brick oven? Patricia&#039;s. Grilled (!) pizza? Coals. Hmmm, maybe the owner of Coals can be convinced to open another location in JH since it seems like the neighborhood can use an interesting pizza place with a good beer selection and relaxing vibe.<br /><br />http://coalspizza.com<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3193/2298974666_14b8f125d5.jpg)<br /><br />*edit: photo not by me.

				OK, I&#039;m going to ignore that picture posted by jadasie right above.&nbsp; OMG!<br /><br />Anyway, I just picked up what I believe is probably the best slice I&#039;ve had to date at Gustoso on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; The crust was thin and crispy, just the way I like it.&nbsp; Also, this was not a regular slice.&nbsp; It was pre-made and was loaded with sweet red peppers, bits of red onion, slices of white onion and broccoli.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t have much cheese, if at all, but I don&#039;t see that as a negative.&nbsp; The slice was tasty and very filling.

				About two weeks ago I was walking by Pizza Boy on 74th St and noticed a Grandma Pizza in the window.&nbsp; I had never seen this before.&nbsp; I ordered a slice for $2 and it was very good.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen it again.&nbsp; I did mention why no more Grandma pizza but all I keep hearing is maybe tomorrow.&nbsp;

				Mike V,<br /><br />I am lazy so I always get my pizza from Pizza Boy (closest to my apartment).&nbsp; I would estimate that they have the grandma slices available about 75% of the time.&nbsp; I like it a lot better than their regular slice.&nbsp; It depends on who is working there - there&#039;s one guy that makes better pizza than the other two employees.

				Lilybell, are you sure you&#039;re not confusing the Sicilian slices with Grandma pizza.&nbsp; A Grandma pizza is a thin layer of dough stretched into an oiled square Sicilian pan.&nbsp; It&#039;s topped with shredded mozzarella, crushed uncooked canned plum tomatoes, chopped garlic &amp; oilive oil.&nbsp; I pass this pizza place every day, and again, I&#039;ve only seen the Grandma pizza once.&nbsp; Next time you stop by ask the regular pizza maker about the Grandma pizza.&nbsp;

				Hi Mike,<br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m sure I know the difference.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like thick crust pizza so I would never order Sicilian.&nbsp; Maybe I am just lucky that they tend to have it available when I go (which isn&#039;t very often, to be honest).&nbsp; But now that they have two new-ish employees, they don&#039;t have it as often.&nbsp;
