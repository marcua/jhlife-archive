If a broker lists a home on MLS or RLS, aren&#039;t they agreeing to co-broke? How did that broker manage not to co-broke when listing on MLS?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I realize there&#039;s an inconsistency with my above post. Thanks for pointing it out. <br /><br />I believe the issue in that particular case was that because the listing agent didn&#039;t advertise on the NYTIMES or Streeteasy, they were depending primarily on getting a direct deal. While an MLS listing may bring a cobrokers or two, it&#039;s nothing compared to the amount of buy side agents that will visit a property if it&#039;s advertised through medium that are most commonly used in NYC. <br /><br />The vast majority of sales deals in NYC are cobrokes, so if you only advertise on a site that primarily caters to Long Island, you&#039;re more likely to have a direct deal. <br /><br />That&#039;s the only logical conclusion I can come to as to why an agent wouldn&#039;t advertise in the NYTIMES or Streeteasy. <br /><br />But it would be great if an agent who only uses MLS could pipe in here!<br /><br />

However, I still stand correct (see NYC native&#039;s comments). &nbsp;If it&#039;s really a junior 4 as in your other examples, I&#039;m not too offended. Please read the layout &nbsp;of Armen&#039;s apartment I posted at reply #14 (Armen himself has already removed the floor plan on his web listing, not a surprise). I don&#039;t think you have ever looked at the floor plan of the apartment 2G &nbsp;(too lazy to click my link) I mentioned, see the attachment. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The floor plan in reply #14 is a classic Junior 4 layout that&#039;s commonly converted to 2brs. I know that many people actually prefer this type of layout for a Junior 4 because it creates a split bedroom. The bedroom is separate from the living area and other &quot;true&quot; bedroom and gives some privacy if it&#039;s being used as a guest room.<br /><br />It also allows parents to be active in the living area while the baby is sleeping - the kitchen provides a bit of a buffer. Junior 4 layouts where the &quot;4&quot; part is like an extension of the living room do not provide this privacy. Case in point, I have some friends in Brooklyn who recently had a baby, and converted the &quot;4&quot; part of their apartment to a nursery. The nursery opens up into the living room, and they can no longer watch TV after the baby goes to sleep. If they had an apartment similar to Armen&#039;s listing, this wouldn&#039;t be a problem. <br /><br />emkayoh, I have certainly seen some listings that say &quot;1.5 bedroom&quot; instead of Junior 4, or Flex 2. But again, Flex 2 is a standard term that&#039;s used in the city, so you&#039;ll probably see that more than 1.5 bedroom. <br /><br />And while I understand how it can be frustrating within your own search parameters, I know from experience that many clients would click on that same ad and have a positive experience. An &quot;A-Ha&quot; moment if you will, because they realize that they can have some of the benefits of a 2br at a lower price point. <br />As you stated, the fact remains that true 2brs are often much more expensive in JH. These flex 2&#039;s are great options for people who want to buy but can&#039;t afford a true two bedroom.<br />Someone stated in a previous post &quot;You get what you pay for.&quot; And while I understand that sentiment, unfortunately, not everyone has the means to spend $500K at the Chateau. <br /><br />Regardless, I feel like I&#039;m beating a dead horse here. <br /><br />jh_coop_buyer let us know where you end up! And best of luck with your search! <br /><br />

But if a broker only lists on MLS in NYC, they&#039;re missing the majority of buyers. <br /><br />Most buyers in NYC are looking on Streeteasy and the NYTIMES. Now my sense is that one of the reasons why listing brokers may not advertise on these sites is because of the potential for other brokers to want to bring in their buy side clients and cobroke. The vast majority of listings on the NYTIMES and Streeteasy, are being cobroked.<br /><br />I know of an instance at my own company where a client in Sunnyside was trying to sell their apartment for months with a broker who was only advertising on MLS and not cobroking. When the exclusive contract with that broker ended and we took over the listing, we advertised on the NYTIMES and had contracts out in a week in a cobroke deal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					&nbsp;jh_coop_buyer, it&#039;s fine if you disagree with some of the things that have been said here.<br /><br />But it&#039;s a complete drag that you&#039;re being so combative, especially since we took the time to provide you with some valuable information. <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to call someone out about something, please have it be about something they&#039;re doing that is actually wrong!<br /><br />The way Armen advertised his property is in line with standard industry practice. I gave several other examples to support this, and yet still you insist on calling him out for doing something that is actually quite normal.<br /><br />Please take the time to reread my post about this. It&#039;s actually quite important that other people reading this know that this is normal, and in fact GOOD! It helps you sell your property, as it brings in buyers who might not have initially considered it. And it also helps buyers, who might find and fall in love with a home that they might not have initially considered! <br /><br />And no, I wouldn&#039;t list this apartment as a 3br. If there was a 2br apartment with a separate dining area that could be converted to a BR, I would probably list that as a 3BR or Flex-3BR<br /><br />If you take the time search, you can probably find many examples that of this from a wide range of brokerage companies. <br /><br />Regardless, I wish you best of luck with your search!<br />And whether you choose to buy or rent, I&#039;m sure that you&#039;ll love living here in Jackson Heights!<br />It&#039;s a GREAT neighborhood!<br /><br /><br /><br />

					It&#039;s interesting. When I first moved to Jackson Heights 5 years ago, even though I was a broker in Manhattan and had been involved in sales deals in Jackson Heights, my knowledge of the rental market here was limited. I had just a day to find a place, so I knew that I needed to hire a broker to make sure that I would see as many places as possible and thus make the most informed decision. It was funny, being an experienced broker, hiring a broker to help me. <br /><br />But I actually learned quite a bit in the process.<br /><br />However, I think it&#039;s a bit different with sales. <br /><br />One of the challenges for buyers in using a local broker is that they may not have initially been interested in the area that they ultimately end up in.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done numerous deals over the years where my clients end up in neighborhoods that they didn&#039;t initially expect. And I would also say that the vast majority of work in sales happens after the apartment has been found - in negotiating the price and contract, preparing the board package, working on securing a mortgage. If a buyer has secured a broker that they know and feel comfortable with in handling these aspects of the sale, it&#039;s unfortunate that they wouldn&#039;t be able to use their services and be represented by them due to the policies of a listing company (policies that are not in line with the vast majority of companies in the city).<br /><br />So to this end, I think that when local agencies don&#039;t CO-broke, they are potentially cutting out clients who are loyal to a buyers broker that they want to work with and who may have not initially thought of the area.<br />

New York has always been a transient place - it&#039;s one of the things that makes it such an amazing city. Let&#039;s not discriminate against people just because of the amount of time that they choose to make this place their home. <br /><br />Secondly, thinking that a broker who grew up in or has lived in the neighborhood for a long time is going to do a better job selling an apartment than someone who doesn&#039;t live in the neighborhood is, in my opinion, a bit misquided.<br />I&#039;ve dealt with brokers from Queens representing Queens listings who were extremely professional, well informed and intelligent (and from small and large companies) and with brokers who were rude and inept (from both large and small companies). Go for the best broker, not just the broker who lives in your building, or lives in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Finally, I don&#039;t really understand how a cobroker bringing in a client from Manhattan or Brooklyn or Upstate, or quite frankly, from Jupiter or Mars, is a bad thing.<br />When I have a listing, it&#039;s my goal to sell my client&#039;s apartment for the best price possible in the shortest amount of time. If the purchaser is qualified, and spits fire and has a green tongue, or is from Manhattan is all completely besides the point.<br /><br />It&#039;s not my job to make these judgements. My job and my fiduciary responsibility to my seller is to present all offers and to make sure that as many potential buyers have access to the apartment as possible. To not do so is a disservice to my client, and ultimately to the community.

I believe most buyers in Jackson Heights want to live like a family. Do we seriously like to live like a dorm town in Manhattan so the brokers can jack up the price as high in Manhattan? &nbsp;If that happens, most family will go to other areas for example (Forest Hills, Rego Park, Elmhurst) to find real homes.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here&#039;s four other apartments that are Junior 4s that are listed as 2brs with various brokerages in Jackson Heights. <br /><br /><a href="http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/748569-coop-8510-34th-avenue-jackson-heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/748569-coop-8510-34th-avenue-jackson-heights</a><br /><br /><a href="http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/749173-coop-37-27-86th-street-jackson-heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/749173-coop-37-27-86th-street-jackson-heights</a><br /><br /><a href="http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/742239-coop-77-12-35-ave-jackson-heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/742239-coop-77-12-35-ave-jackson-heights</a><br /><br /><a href="http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/695921-coop-37-31-73rd-street-jackson-heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/695921-coop-37-31-73rd-street-jackson-heights</a><br /><br />I&#039;m posting these because I believe that it should be made clear that Armen was doing nothing deceitful or tricky in listing his own exclusives as a 2BR. <br /><br />This is standard industry practice, and as you see, I was able to find a total of four separate companies doing this in just a cursory look at Streeteasy. <br /><br />Also, to make it clear, I was not implying that we want to turn Jackson Heights into a dorm, and considering the rental policies of most COOPS, I think it would be very difficult to rent to college students anyway. The flex threes and twos that I show my clients in Manhattan are in rental buildings. I primarily show them to clients who can&#039;t afford a $5000 2br. <br /><br />But the idea is similar. For families who can&#039;t afford $400K+ for a historic Garden building 2br, the Junior 4s and flex 2s offer a good alternative. <br /><br /><br />

Somehow, the trick of misleading information or stretching the facts too much turns me away immediately. For example, you have listed the apartment 35-36 76th Street, #323 as a two bedroom apartment.&nbsp; Anybody looking at the floor can only consider it as &quot;ONE&quot; bedroom apartment. The dinning area can not be considered a separate bedroom (the flex room is such a fancy word). Even for a junior 4 in most jackson heights coop buildings, the dinning room that can be also served as a bedroom has its own walls and its closet and the kitchen has its own window. <br /><br />The floor plan is attached here so other people may examine it. I am hoping the reply does not get eliminated and you may revise your list to make my claim sounds unfounded and this is the last post I will comment on you web listing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s actually a fairly common practice to advertise a converted one bedroom as a flex2 bedroom, or 2 bedroom apartment. <br /><br />And in this instance it actually looks like the conversion of the dining area in to a separate &quot;room&quot; was very well done. <br /><br />While I&#039;m sure that the sellers are asking a premium on this, it&#039;s not like they&#039;re trying to charge $400K + for it calling a &quot;true 2BR.&quot;<br /><br />The word &quot;flex&quot; is something you&#039;ll see often. I particularly used this idea a lot in Manhattan when I had college roommates who couldn&#039;t afford a true 2br. <br />They would take a 1br, put a wall in the living room and turn it into a 2br.<br /><br />And I think the intention is similar here. I know of a lot of families in JH that use this layout with the dining &quot;room&quot; as a baby room. It&#039;s a great option for people who may want some of the benefits of a 2br (separate room, some added privacy for guests, baby room) but can&#039;t afford a true 2br. <br /><br />Does that make sense?<br /><br />I too have often seen clients feel like this was misrepresentation, and I can certainly understand how it comes across that way. But by listing it as a 2br, it opens up options that some people might not have initially considered if it was listed as a straight 1br. &nbsp;

					I still respectfully disagree!<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that the median price for an apartment in the neighborhood is $300,000, and that listing brokers are only getting paid 3%. <br /><br />Now let&#039;s say there&#039;s a massive uprising in the neighborhood among sellers and they demand that listing agents start cobroking. They agree to pay an additional 3% for a buyers broker but increase listed prices for their apartments by 3% to make up for this. So now the price becomes $309,000. And let&#039;s say that they want to have a bit more of a cushion, so they increase the price to $315,000, or $320,000.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s say that your buyers broker, through negotiation, is able to get 5% off the price for you. That&#039;s $16,000 off. And you end up closing at $304,000.<br /><br />We&#039;re talking about a $4,000 difference on the price of the apartment. If it were up to me, and I was investing $60,000 (20% down), I&#039;d be willing to take out an extra $4000 on my loan so that I could be represented by someone who is experienced.<br /><br />Now obviously scenarios can easily be made where there is a greater savings, but in general, I would say that the difference is often less than one would assume. <br /><br />At our firm, we go over each offer with the partners of the firm. Often times I&#039;ll discuss it with my managers at great length. We all work as a team. The two partners of the firm are Harvard and Columbia grads who both worked in investment banking for years. They have a great deal of financial savvy, to say the least. We hyper analyze each deal to make sure that we&#039;re coming in with an offer that will get our clients the apartment they love at the best price possible. <br /><br />My strong belief is that for a buyer, it is certainly worth it to have this kind of team on your side when making the single greatest investment of your life. <br /><br />Aram<br />______________________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br />O: 212.864.4555<br />C: 917.348.0704<br />F: 212.706.2939<br /><a href="mailto:aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com" class="bbc_email">aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian</a><br /><br />

					Exactly! Determining how much of a premium should be paid for things like an extra full bath vs extra half bath, and things of this nature can often be more difficult to ascertain than coming up with comps for a standard 1br or 2br apartment. I once did comps for a client in Manhattan who was buying a condo with a large balcony. It was very interesting to see how much of a premium was paid for a balcony. I believe at the time, it was less than one would have thought, and we were able to use that info to competitively and aggressively negotiate with the seller. I saved my client over $100,000 on that deal.<br /><br />However, I will also say that with details like these when there is not a lot of closed sales data, it often comes down to an &quot;educated guess.&quot; One can look at data from other neighborhoods. For example, in Sunnyside, or Woodside, how much of a premium does an extra half bath vs full bath get?<br /><br />Perhaps those percentages will give you more data with which to make an &quot;educated guess&quot; on what to offer.<br /><br />Regarding your statement about unrepresented buyers, I stand by my statement that it is beneficial for both the buyer and the seller to have the buyer be represented. <br /><br />If you disagree, then that&#039;s great! Certainly people buy apartments in NYC all the time and are unrepresented. But I do think that there is much more involved with buying a COOP in NYC than most people think. And I can&#039;t see any negative to having responsive, intelligent and diligent broker who deals with sales on a day to day basis on your side.<br /><br />Aram<br />______________________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br />O: 212.864.4555<br />C: 917.348.0704<br />F: 212.706.2939<br /><a href="mailto:aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com" class="bbc_email">aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian</a><br />

					When making comps for my clients, I generally like to use the most recent sales as my basis for coming up with an offer price. Usually I&#039;ll look back six months to a year at most, though I&#039;ll also include older listings if there&#039;s a specific reason to do so.<br /><br />Another important thing to look at is the Price Per Square foot. Sometimes coop listings won&#039;t include this, but through some careful sleuthing you can often find a similar apartment in the building that will have it listed from a previous sale. I also examine the maintenance per square foot. If this number in significantly higher than other properties in the area, it may be an indication of financial distress in the building. I also look at the percent difference between the listed price and the actual sale price, and the amount of time the apartment was on the market. If apartments are closing at or around their listing price, and quickly, it indicates that we may have less room to negotiate. <br /><br />Regardless, I think that your experience here speaks to a post I made yesterday. <br /><br />Sellers agents not cobroking their listings brings buyers who are unrepresented. This does a huge disservice to not only the buyer, but the seller as well.<br /><br />Buying a home is one of single greatest investments that a person can make. Why would anyone want to go into a situation where they are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a home, and yet are not represented by a competent real estate professional? It doesn&#039;t make sense to me. <br /><br />Regardless, feel free to read through the post I made yesterday.<br /><br /><a href="index.php@topic=8051.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8051.0</a><br /><br />And feel free to ask any more questions! <br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Aram<br /><br />______________________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br />O: 212.864.4555<br />C: 917.348.0704<br />F: 212.706.2939<br /><a href="mailto:aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com" class="bbc_email">aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian</a>

					Hello Jackson Heights Community,<br /><br />I have been living in Jackson Heights for a number of years now. It&#039;s a neighborhood I wanted to live in since I first moved to NYC and started work on my Masters at Columbia. It&#039;s an amazingly vibrant community, and I love being a part of it!<br /><br />From repeated conversations with friends and acquaintances around the community, I&#039;ve been hearing time and time again that people are having difficulty finding and purchasing in JH, as well as selling their apartments.<br /><br />This has left me puzzled.<br /><br />For the past eight years, I&#039;ve worked as a Real Estate Broker with the firm Cooper &amp; Cooper.<br /><br />It&#039;s a really great firm - all of the agents are articulate and well educated. I&#039;ve made many life long friends through my work at the company.<br /><br />While I&#039;ve primarily worked in sales in both Manhattan &amp; Brooklyn, I&#039;ve recently started working with clients who are interested in Jackson Heights. The basic profile of these clients is similar. They are usually renting in Manhattan or Brooklyn and want to look in Jackson Heights to buy, as they can get more for their money here.&nbsp; As a member of the community, I see this as a huge benefit and an exciting opportunity for our neighborhood to grow and improve.<br /><br />However, in setting up tours to view properties in the neighborhood, I&#039;ve been frustrated and displeased with the resistance by some listing agents here in Jackson Heights to work with cooperating brokers.&nbsp; This is not common in most neighborhoods in New York City.&nbsp; The vast majority of sales transactions in NYC are what we call a â€œCo-Brokeâ€. For example, when a seller negotiates an exclusive contract with a sales agent, the commission paid to the listing broker upon completion of the sale is typically 6% of the sales price (although that can be negotiated in some cases).<br /><br />In the case of most sales in NYC, that 6% commission will be split between the listing broker and the broker who brings the buyer (thus encouraging more buyers to see and bid on your property).&nbsp; However, if a client comes and sees the apartment directly, with no broker representation, the listing broker is entitled to keep the entirety of that commission as the selling broker.&nbsp; As you can imagine, the ability to collect the full commission on a â€œdirectâ€ deal (unrepresented buyer) becomes very attractive to a listing broker, but does not serve the clientâ€™s best interest at all!<br /><br />As I mentioned above, in most cases interested clients looking to buy will come with their own broker, called a buyerâ€™s broker. This agent represents them, not just helping them find an apartment, but also aiding them in negotiation, in contracts, finding a lawyer and mortgage broker, assembling the board package, etc.. The buyerâ€™s broker will co-broke the commission with the listing agent, splitting it 50/50. So if the commission listed in the contract is 6%, the listing agent gets 3% and the buyerâ€™s broker gets 3%.&nbsp; This is also beneficial to the seller because the apartment is advertised without hesitation to the entire brokerage community, bringing more buyers to their property.&nbsp; Additionally, represented buyers are often better qualified since they have been prepared and educated by the broker with whom they are working.&nbsp; This reduces time lost with board turndowns, drawn out contract processes, etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />If I was a seller, and I was paying a listing agent 6% of the sales price, I would be enraged that a well qualified client was unable to have representation of their own and see my property, because my agent refused to split the commission I was paying them. It does not matter that the listing agent&#039;s company splits their portion of the commission through their company. It&#039;s in fact, irrelevant. At my own company, we often have commission splits that extend between multiple agents. But we would never misrepresent our clients and/or not co-broke an apartment because of our commission split. That would be unethical and sometimes worse, illegal.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />That said, I understand that this is not only a â€œbrokerâ€ issue in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I have heard of situations in which listing brokers are only offered 2-3% commission to represent an owner.&nbsp; On the face of it, this seems like a great way to save some money on the sale of your home.&nbsp; However, in reality this rarely benefits the seller for the same reason listed above.&nbsp; If a seller is â€œforcingâ€ a listing broker to accept a 2-3% commission, they are essentially ensuring that the listing broker can (and will) only show that property to unrepresented or direct purchasers.&nbsp; Anyone working with a broker (which is the vast majority of buyers â€“ especially those looking to move from one neighborhood to another) is completely shut out of the process.&nbsp; You end up with lower purchase prices, more difficult deals, unqualified buyers and frustration with your representation (whoâ€™s hands are tied)..<br /><br />In Jackson Heights specifically, I have been surprised to see that many brokerage firms will not co-broke with buyers agents.&nbsp; As an owner, or potential buyer, this should not be allowed to continue in our community. <br /><br />My hope is that this post will explain this concept of co-broking to unknowing apartment owners here in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I want to educate both brokers and sellers in order to make our neighborhood an attractive and accessible one to buyers and renters alike.<br /><br />If anyone here has any questions regarding this and would like to reach out to me, please don&#039;t hesitate to!<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to be a resource and to help in any way that I can.<br /><br />Best,<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />______________________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br /><br /><a href="mailto:aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com" class="bbc_email">aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian</a>

					Yes, with sponsor sales, there is no board approval, so you wouldn&#039;t need any reserves.<br /><br />With non-sponsor sales, I generally make sure that my clients will have at least 6 months in reserves after closing costs, which can be anywhere from 2-6% of the purchase price (depending on the type of apartment you&#039;re purchasing). There are certainly some boards that will require more than this. And like another poster said, they will be looking thoroughly through your employment history, tax returns and investments to make sure that you&#039;re going to be able to keep making the monthly maintenance payments in the future.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to have no reserves after the purchase, my sense is that a sponsor sale is the way to go for you. <br /><br />Aram<br />____________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br />C: 917.348.0704<br />F: 212.706.2939 <br /><a href="mailto:aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com" class="bbc_email">aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.CooperCooper.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.CooperCooper.com</a>
