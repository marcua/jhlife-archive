				They did arrive late--minor flaw--but they brought all their own equipment and supplies, and they are cleaning this apartment within an inch of its life. They started at 10:30 AM, took a brief lunch break, and are now in the last room at almost 6PM. They likely have an hour to go. Very thorough--we have a biweekly cleaner come in, but the job she does is nothing like this &quot;deep clean.&quot; I&#039;m thinking I should have this done several times a year. They dusted EVERYTHING, cleaned inside of baskets then put the contents back, vacuumed curtains, cleaned blinds, cleaned ceiling light fixtures, cleaned windows, dusted shelves and all the books and LPs--really thorough. You choose what you want done, though--I think I clicked on everything they listed online. You can likely do less and pay less. I have two people cleaning. I think they are excellent and plan to tip very well on top of the not cheap (but reasonable IMO--it&#039;s a lot of work) price. I expected to pay a substantial price for this kind of cleaning. Now I have to have the furniture steam cleaned as well...(getting rid of cat dander...)

				They actually cleaned until almost 9 PM after starting at 10:30 AM. We gave substantial tips. Now that the dust has literally cleared, I am seeing a couple of spots they missed--but this was a very big job considering the depth of cleaning--not just the more superficial job our regular cleaner does with a little dusting, vacuuming, etc. If you are having an empty house cleaned it will be easier by far.

Two cleaners, nearly four hours, needed little direction. This didnâ€™t include windows and cabinet cleaning, which is additional. We would use them again.
