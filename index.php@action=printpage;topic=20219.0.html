				This is the first year that we will not be going to Long Island for Thanksgiving with my family, primarily due to COVID. I&#039;m looking to buy two Thanksgiving dinners, that I can either pick up in the immediate Jackson Height area maybe the day before, or have delivered the day before. Last year when Farine was still in business I know they had dinners that people could order, but since they&#039;re not an option I&#039;m wondering if anyone has a suggestion for somewhere to order from.&nbsp; Thanks so much!

				The queensboro did catered thanksgiving last year (i.e. takeout of a whole meal). They hopefully will do it again; drop them a line!<br /><br />https://www.thequeensboro.com/

				&nbsp;The past couple of years, no one in our extended family wanted to cook much. We have ordered a turkey, side and trimmings from Whole Foods and economically heated up Thanksgiving dinner for 10-12 people for about $100/125 dollars. Added our own desserts and fyi, both years we had leftovers. We pick up in Williamsburg because of easier parking there but Bryant Park and Union Square both are accessible from JH. It&#039;s just another option if you can&#039;t find anything you like here or might not want to go out on Thanksgiving day.

				Casa del Chef is also doing Thanksgiving dinner for takeout/delivery. Definitely expensive at $55/pp, but it seems like a lot of food for one, so it may well go further. https://tmt.spotapps.co/ordering-menu?spot_id=6791&amp;accordion=true&amp;images=yes&amp;source=pop_up&amp;destination=order&amp;promotion=order_online&amp;_ga=2.166513598.1046046234.1603893407-1426117732.1603893407

				I never had it and I&#039;m not recommending it&nbsp; but Boston Market also caters Thanksgiving with turkeys and sides.&nbsp; I would think their prices might be more reasonable than many places.
