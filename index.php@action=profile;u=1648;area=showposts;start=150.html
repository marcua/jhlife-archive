					Thanks for asking...&nbsp; I issued my first quarter 2010 report last week.&nbsp; The report has been &quot;improved&quot; and now provides an analysis of properties within and outside the Jackson Heights Historic District, and looks at closings - by apartment size - for the original Queensboro built cooperatives (from Laurel Court through The Towers) as far back as 2003.&nbsp; You can obtain a copy of my first quarter 2010 report by subscribing at <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br /><br />A quick summary for the 11372 zip code:<br /><br />Houses:&nbsp; While the number of sales rose (albeit off of a very low level), average sales prices continued to decline<br /><br />Apartments: The number of sales declined compared to the year-ago and prior quarters, although prices remained relatively stable<br /><br />The spring selling season has been somewhat muted.&nbsp; The end of the Federal tax credit may have pulled some demand forward.<br /><br />All of the details by property type (one-, two- and three-family houses, prewar and postwar coops, and condominiums) can be found in the first quarter report.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br /><a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a>

					After well over 40+ years, it looks as though another Jackson Heights institution is closing - Newman Jewelers, at 78th Street and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Only one security gate is open, the door says &quot;store closed,&quot; and merchandise is being taken out into trucks.<br /><br />My brother and I bought our Mother&#039;s Day gifts there in the 1960s......

					I contacted the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) and yes, they must and will opine and approve any proposed new building PRIOR to any Dept. of Buildings permits being issued.&nbsp; Obviously, any new proposed construction on the scale of these blockfronts will require that the owner(s) follow all of the rules... and in our case the rules begin with those promulgated by the LPC.&nbsp; So that is good news.<br /><br />Demolishing an existing/still standing building in a historic disrict is far more complicated than building one on an empty lot.&nbsp; But with that said, the LPC does does not have to approve something that the zoning allows.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, if you are concerned about what happens in our community get involved.

					This is an excellent idea.&nbsp; Twenty years ago architect, resident, and JHBG Board Member Fred Fox prepared a rendering of a proposed building to be built on the ashes of where 82-11 37th Avenue now stands.&nbsp; The owner had planned for a lovely glass tower; note, this was before we were landmarked.&nbsp; Ultimately, a building very similar to Fred&#039;s proposal rose on the site, even though it did not have to adhere to LPC rules because its foundation had been poured prior to our being designated.<br /><br />So the call is out to local architects and interested parties to contact the JHBG and develop ideas and proposals that will enhance the character of our Historic District.&nbsp; Danny Dromm has agreed to meet with us in the near future.&nbsp; So if you have the interest, talent, and the time, go to <a href="http://www.jhbg.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhbg.org</a> and email us with your contact information.&nbsp; I would also suggest that if we can get a half dozen interested people who can commit to making a difference, we can also start the process of expanding our historic district. NOW IS THE TIME!

					37th Avenue, in the area of immediate concern - from 84th to 86th Streets - is zoned R7-1 with a C1-3 overlay.&nbsp; The zoning handbook will specify precisely what and how much can be built. Rest assured every developer, architect, and/or engineer will do there best to build as large as legally possible, if that is the owner&#039;s desire.&nbsp; We need to demand that any development includes parking.&nbsp; The only saving grace is the LPC approval process for the aesthetic choices the owner/architect make.

					Having been involved with these issues for many years, the LPC rules that are broken, are broken by the merchants and commercial property owners themselves... sorry for not being as sympathetic as others at this trying time.&nbsp; Compare the new Bank of America branch on 82nd Street - that followed the LPC rules to a T, and the lovely Wang&#039;s 99 Cent store around the corner on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; The fact that they illegally installed a red awning was their decision (I always suggest to people that you vote with your dollar and patronize businesses that respect our community... but don&#039;t get me started).&nbsp; This violation has been reported to the LPC.&nbsp; The LPC cannot force people to obey the law.&nbsp; And unfortunately it takes a while, and a willing property owner, to have illegal signs and awnings removed. <br /><br />I believe there is a commercial overlay to the zoning along most of 37th Avenue, allowing for at least one or two floors of commercial. If they want to build to the maximum amount within the broader envelope, the remainder would likely be residential...whatever makes economic sense... note the other apartment buildings on 37th Avenue have one story of commercial.<br /><br />And don&#039;t rely on the Community Board or elected officials to &quot;do&quot; for us.&nbsp; They need to be lobbied, cajoled, and told what our expectations are.&nbsp; Again, this means attending meetings and making our voices heard.&nbsp; That is the ONLY way things get done.

					The rules cited above were promulgated for new storefronts and renovations done to existing commercial structures.&nbsp; Because the site of the fire is in the the Jackson Heights Historic District, any new construction must be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.&nbsp; New construction can, however, be built within the existing zoning envelope for that site, but the exterior of any proposed structure must be approved by the LPC.&nbsp; <br /><br />The building that rose out of the ruins of the arson fire that took place on 37th Avenue between 82nd and 83rd Streets over 20 years ago was NOT subject to LPC approval because a foundation for the new building had been poured <span class="bbc_u">prior </span> to Jackson Heights being landmarked in October 1993.&nbsp; The only reason that this building blends in well was because of the efforts of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group. In fact this fire was a preciptating event for the creation of the JHBG.&nbsp; It is up to us to make sure our concerns and expectations are heard by our elected officials and the LPC.&nbsp; This will be a long process, and our community needs people who are committed to volunteering some of their time to get this done.&nbsp; Please contact the JHBG <a href="http://www.jhbg.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhbg.org</a> to get involved.<br /><br />With this devastating fire, and the emptying of half of a 37th Avenue blockfront one block away (to ready it for a sale - the site of the Cavalier), it is highly likely that our historic district will be subject to some &quot;new development.&quot;&nbsp; If we are truly concerned about what potential new construction means for Jackson Heights, over the next year we will all need to do more than just talk - we need to get involved and effect positive change.

					Thanks Francis.&nbsp; <br /><br />If the commercial tenant actually reads the lease before signing it, they will find out that the property is in a NYC historic district and that there are rules and regulations regarding what they can and cannot do to the exterior of the property.&nbsp; This notification requirement has been in effect for about a dozen years.&nbsp; Whether the tenant - or their attorney - read it, we don&#039;t know... but it was there.&nbsp; And, unfortunately, whether they decide to comply is up to them.&nbsp; So it is imperative that we notify the Landmarks Preservation Commission for each and every violation.<br /><br />You can take a digital photo (if you like, it can&#039;t hurt) and email it along with the address to:&nbsp; Katy Rice&nbsp; <a href="mailto:krice@lpc.nyc.gov" class="bbc_email">krice@lpc.nyc.gov</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Katy is our violations contact<br /><br />The more we get involved and actually &quot;do&quot; rather than simply &quot;complain&quot; the better our community will look.
