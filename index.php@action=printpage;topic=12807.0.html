				Is it just me or have other people noticed this store going downhill?<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Unpleasant odor in the back where meat and dairy sections intersect<br />2.&nbsp; Funky fresh vegetables<br />3.&nbsp; Boxes of mdse/displays on floor blocking the aisles<br />4.&nbsp; Broken/missing floor tiles<br />5.&nbsp; Usually only 2 registers open no matter how crowded.

				the first two complaints would have me headed to the door without question, the last three, i&#039;d chalk up to living in nyc and shrug off as normal. but on balance, if i smelled or saw funk where funk should not exist, i&#039;d steer clear.

				I haven&#039;t noticed, but I haven&#039;t been in a few weeks. It&#039;s a shame if it is going downhill. This is one I considered higher quality and much more pleasant to shop at than all the rest of the JH grocery stores.

				It&#039;s been like that for awhile now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t buy meat there.&nbsp; (Trade Fair is like that too - or whatever it&#039;s now called.) I just go for quick things.&nbsp; When they first opened, the fruit and vegetables were amazing - very good quality and plenty of it.&nbsp; For the past year, they&#039;ve been sub par and nothing special.&nbsp; They are also a very small grocery so they only sell one kind of everything - it&#039;s very hard to shop healthy there.&nbsp; They also do not recycle plastic bags.&nbsp; I used to be a fan, but no longer.&nbsp; To be honest, the grocery stores here aren&#039;t great.&nbsp; I end up buying things at a bunch of different places, a little at a time.&nbsp; The greenmarket is nice and some of the fruit/veggie places are decent on 37th.

				It sure has!! I was getting lazy about walking down to 37th ave and buying produce in Mi Tierra- it was good for a while but lately everything has been rotten. I&#039;ve noticed Waldbaums getting worse as well. Mice traps, broken tiles, expired food, empty freezers etc. I prefer Trader joes, whole foods and Stop N Shop. I only use the neighborhood stores in a pinch.

It&#039;s like a mini Trader Joe&#039;s. Then you can hop on the 32--which is right in front of the place--to complete your journey at no additional cost.<br /><br />...and Parrot for Mediterranean stuff is directly across the Boulevard. <br /><br />just an idea.<br /><br />jeanette

				Thanks Jeanette!&nbsp; I&#039;ll check it out.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t mind traveling for food - I to go to Trader Joe&#039;s on 22nd and 6th and hop the F train home about every couple of months.&nbsp; And I do love the 32 bus so your recommendation is a plus.

				Man.. these roundabout trips everywhere are too much for my schedule for grocery shopping. I just use Foodtown and Lemon Farm. They aren&#039;t the best but Foodtown is at least clean and consistent. Lemon Farm is good for certain hard to find or specialty things as long as you pay close attention to expiry dates. They&#039;re both on my way home so it works out for the best as far as balance between quality and use of my time.<br /><br />We also use Fresh Direct sometimes, but they are a little more expensive. They do tend to have some better quality items though and you can&#039;t beat the convenience of &quot;bring it straight to my door&quot;.

				This weekend I used www.peapod.com It is the Stop &amp; Shop delivery service and uses the S&amp;S member card number plan and flyer so you can order that way, too. <br /><br />It was fine. Better than fine in that I only had to open my door. There are no boxes to deal with. They deliver in shopping bags (odd but it works) and heavy shopping bags.<br /><br />They were right on time, polite and a lot more food for the same amount of money spent at Fresh Direct.<br /><br />They have a good selection of Gluten Free and Organic foods. <br /><br />You might try them.<br /><br />I guess this is a very round about way of saying I feel Mi Tierra has really gone down hill, too.
