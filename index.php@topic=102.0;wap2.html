			A friend (Diana) asked me to post that she is looking for two people to help serve and clean up and maybe serve drinks at her birthday party on December 23rd, 2007, in Jackson Heights &nbsp;from 3-8. She can pay $70 per person. <br /><br />

			Hi:<br /><br />If you are looking for experienced servers contact Steve at the Jewish Center.<br /><br />He&#039;s catered many events over the years and trained an excellent cadre of servers.<br /><br />I recently attended a dinner at the Jewish Center and was impressed at how neighborhood souls handled their duties....<br /><br />Itty
