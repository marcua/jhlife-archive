				Open just a few months, I&#039;ve eaten there twice and really enjoyed my meals.<br /><br />It&#039;s on Roosevelt ave. and 53 street, the same side as La Flor, just across the street. <br /><br />As of last week they didn&#039;t have their liquor license, so it was byob.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had the picadillo, pork chops, ropa vieja, and a really good steak. Large portions that come with white or yellow rice and red/black beans. The maduros are fabulous.&nbsp; <br /><br />The people are quite nice, the waitress brewed us fresh iced tea. The service is rather slow, I don&#039;t believe they are truly Cuban, but the food was tasty and inexpensive. $40 for two including tip, with leftovers to bring home.

				Ernie, I was over on Roose. at 52nd today and saw Mojitos.&nbsp; I liked their colors: lime green outside, rusty, warm colors inside, lots of wood.... I just peeked in the window but I thought it looked pretty.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to go check it out.&nbsp; I actually like being able to bring my own bottle of wine so that&#039;s not a bad thing until they get their liquor license.

				Thanks to Ernie for posting about Mojitos and also to Ms. Chatelaine for her mention of it in the Woodside thread.&nbsp; I had an opportunity to try Mojitos tonight along with a couple of friends and really enjoyed it.&nbsp; We had the ropa vieja, arroz con pollo and camarones al ajillo (garlic shrimp).&nbsp; We also shared an order of fried plantains.&nbsp; I felt the arroz con pollo lacked a bit in flavor, perhaps because it was prepared using boneless chicken breast rather than chicken on the bone...the bone imparts lots of flavor, so there is some room left for improvement on this dish.&nbsp; Each dish was accompanied by black beans and a nice salad that included lots of olives.&nbsp; By the way, no iceberg lettuce to be seen here!&nbsp; Overall, I would say that our meal was very good.&nbsp; It was a bit slow in arriving to the table, but our waitress was attentive and friendly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we were the only customers, but I suppose you can attribute that to the fact that the restaurant is still kind of new to the neighborhood.&nbsp; We will definitely return.&nbsp; Buddy, I hope you&#039;re reading this post!<br /><br />Our server explained that the chef is Cuban and is formerly from Havana Chelsea, the Manhattan restaurant that closed recently due to a large rent increase.&nbsp; Mojitos will be offering live entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays starting at approximately 9:00 p.m.&nbsp; Musicians will be playing mostly folkloric music such as guajiras and sones.&nbsp; Still waiting on that liquor license.

				Last night my sister and I tried a new restaurant on the corner of 52nd and Roosevelt. It&#039;s called Mojito and it can easily be spotted by the mint green and white facade.&nbsp; <br /><br />A friend told us it was a Cuban restaurant but looking at the menu that lists &quot;gandoles&quot; (pink beans) with many dishes we determined that it is Cuban/Puerto Rican. The food was delicious and the service was great.&nbsp; The Pernil (roast pork) and the tostones were out of this world.<br /><br />They don&#039;t have a liquor license yet but their is a liquor store right across the street and they will chill any beer or wine you bring in.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				There&#039;s a discussion on Mojitos on JHL at the following thread:<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=675.0<br /><br />I tend to disagree that Mojitos should be considered Puerto Rican in any part, as their menu offerings are Cuban.&nbsp; They may have occasional blackboard specials pairing up pernil with arroz con gandules, but gandules shouldn&#039;t be mistaken for &quot;pink beans&quot;.&nbsp; They are, in fact, pigeon peas and somewhat of a greenish/yellow in color.<br /><br />Sample dishes from Mojitos&#039; menu are:<br /><br />Pollo al Ajillo<br />Ropa Vieja<br />Picadillo<br />Coconut Shrimp<br />Mariquitas<br />Cuban Sandwiches<br />Arroz con Pollo<br />Fricase de Pollo
