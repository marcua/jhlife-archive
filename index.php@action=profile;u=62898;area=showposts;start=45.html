Stop. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17975.msg87215#msg87215">Quote from: lalochezia on July 02, 2018, 01:29:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />You seem to think this is a zero sum game, that&nbsp; one attendee at a new place=one less attendee of an existing restaurant.&nbsp; This is not the case.

People who want a glass of wine and a bistro experience won&#039;t go to 79/ayada now that the queensboro exists. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are spinning or a story about today and tomorrow. I&#039;m talking about 5-10 years from now. . Again quoting you, reading about this &#039;under-served&#039; demographic reads to me like parody. White people have places to eat, they are not under-served.<br /><br />Also i&#039;ve tried to move the focus away from food and on the the general rhetoric of this message board.<br /><br />[/quote]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17975.msg87215#msg87215">Quote from: lalochezia on July 02, 2018, 01:29:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Opining: I think you&#039;re a traumatized gentrification victim, who is trying to absolve themselves from guilt at being part of the problem.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s silly for me to allow you to assume what I am, if i&#039;m trying to make a point. So instead:<br /><br />I am a second generation NYer, born to immigrant parents (from Dominican Republic and Ecuador), in Corona NY. I went to JHS in East Elmhurst. My grandmother still lives in the house I was raised in. My other grandmother lives in East Elmhurst. My familial roots are literally planted in the neighborhoods that are and surround Jackson Heights. <br /><br />I am not a traumatized anything, and the fact that you would use the word absolve makes me think as a gentrifier you have a deep ridden guilt. Alternatively, I consider what I have as a responsibility to be respectful. <br /><br />As I move I understand fully that the privilege my parents and their parents before have afforded me. So when I moved to Jackson Heights from Harlem, as I understood there, I knew I had a responsibility to respect the neighborhood as it was before I came. Note that this was a journey, at first I thought maybe halfway the way people on this board think, but I&#039;ve since realized the place of privilege I come from and my thought process has changed.<br /><br />Never have I felt under-served in Jackson Heights because if I wanted something it didn&#039;t offer, I know it&#039;s easy enough for me to hop on a train or bus to get to it. The idea that I as a resident am under-served is preposterous. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17975.msg87215#msg87215">Quote from: lalochezia on July 02, 2018, 01:29:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Newsflash: if you move to a neighborhood and buy or rent an apartment because you are priced out of an existing one....or if you move to a neighborhood where you have higher than the median income, you are participating in a process which prices out existing residents. Other than leaving the city, there&#039;s no way to fight this on an individual level.&nbsp; This can only be addressed with serious political will, and is likely beyond the scope of sniping on this board.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I understand the POV of the last part of this quote, but I disagree. I think social media has a power people don&#039;t yet understand, although i&#039;m not sure why on account of what it&#039;s doing to out the awful people in this country. <br /><br />I also grew up on message boards&nbsp; so I know that for every loud mouth like you or me, there are <em>just</em> a few people reading who can be swayed in either direction. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17975.msg87218#msg87218">Quote from: CaptainFlannel on July 02, 2018, 02:08:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I love the idea that OP might actually think anyone has been enlightened by OP&#039;s deep thoughts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Case in point, freddie. <br /><br />_______________________________________<br /><br />The reason that The Queensboro was brought up, which i&#039;ve tried to move away from, is that I have no issue with a restaurant like it existing. i DO have an issue with mediocrity, something a lot of people in the world don&#039;t have.<br /><br />As an example, someone in this thread literally reached out to Panera bread to open in Jackson Heights. WHAT?!<br /><br />And so when you come here and take up space and are not even that good?<br /><br />(again, the pizza. it wasn&#039;t good. it doesn&#039;t need to exist. If you&#039;re trying to argue with me about this point, let&#039;s agree to disagree) <br /><br />And for the record, I have no issue telling everyone here that my &#039;reverse racism&#039; gives all minority owned businesses a handicap. So when they open it doesn&#039;t even have to be good. I just hope it serves the purpose of &#039;putting food on the table&#039;, so to speak.<br /><br />When the Queensboro opens, all bets are off. <br /><br />

It&#039;s clear the place will likely succeed due to teachers needing a drink after school, and people in the neighborhood valuing things like &#039;atmosphere&#039; and &#039;ambiance&#039; <br /><br />A competitor I am not, I don&#039;t even think one (a competitor) exists in the neighborhood, another reason the restaurant will likely succeed.

It&#039;s troll-bait.<br /><br />I moved here because I love pharmacies and dollar stores. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Call it what you want, but I&#039;m still genuinely interested. <br /><br />What I see is a lot of people with enough privilege and entitlement to come to a neighborhood and strive to make it what they want, as opposed to coming to a neighborhood and respecting it for what it is. <br /><br />What I see is a lot of people who saw the value in the land and not in the people that existed here before you. And so you bemoan the restaurants pre-existing for not having &#039;ambiance&#039; and &#039;atmosphere&#039; and having &#039;too much flavor&#039; (this is not an exaggeration) and when you patronize restaurants NOT like this I don&#039;t think you understand the future repercussions (displacement, further gentrification, etc.) <br /><br />What I see is people moving to the neighborhood and expecting it to be a one stop shop, asking for things that already exist a stones throw away. <br /><br />And so what I am I interested in is knowing where you came from, where you existed before Jackson Heights and why our point of views differ. Your posts will enlighten me, and mine yours. You might not be asking for it, and that&#039;s the best thing about message boards: the ability to opt out.<br /><br />It&#039;s easier to write this post off as &#039;troll bait&#039; instead of just answering the question and providing your point of view. Sometimes I think that might be because the answers to the question is tough for even yourselves to swallow. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17975.msg87208#msg87208">Quote from: Ed on July 02, 2018, 10:35:50 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">dssjh - if you&#039;re looking for a fine dining experience, I highly recommend ADDICTIVE 87. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t, I recommend going to any other gentrified neighborhoods and patronizing their fine dining.

As a Latina, I get to enjoy a great share of my national cuisine here, but there are times I’ve had to travel outside of Jackson Heights to find the type of meals served at The Queensboro.&nbsp; I’m glad the owners chose Jackson Heights, and I’m happy to support their business.

Being able to dually patronize both minority and majority businesses in the neighborhood is a luxury you should embrace.

					To start, the meaning of this post is to incite discourse. I&#039;m genuinely interested in knowing, and also hoping I can impart my point of view in hopes to enlighten. <br /><br />Why did you move here? <br /><br />I see various posts, in the food forum, in this one, etc. all with intentions of wanting to homogenize this neighborhood with all the rest of the &#039;trendy&#039; neighborhoods in NYC.<br /><br />Why do you need a brunch place? Brunch food is typically garbage (read anthony bourdain, a recent fallen soldier i&#039;m sure all you new transplants love, on the perils of brunch food)<br /><br />Why do you need restaurants serving mediocre american food? on account of the simplicity of what&#039;s typically considered &#039;american&#039; or even &#039;new american&#039; it&#039;s very rare that this is done well. Normally when it is, it&#039;s super expensive. When it&#039;s not, it manifests in the form of places like The Queensboro.<br /><br />If all you wanted was to change Jackson Heights from what it is, into what you want it to be, why didn&#039;t you just move where you ACTUALLY wanted to live. Is it because you couldn&#039;t afford it? Do you realize your pandering to what you want will eventually make you angry and resent all the &#039;change&#039; in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Or did you move here to embrace the multi-cultural aspects of the neighborhood? <br /><br />Did you move here because you want your kids to go to school with people of color and not just white kids, thus expanding their point of view on the world at large. <br /><br />Please, tell me why you moved here, why you decided to stay, why you moved out. <br /><br />I&#039;m genuinely interested because this forum is latent with posts suggesting you might not even be so sure. Enlighten <em>me</em>.

					could i recommend vitsoe instead of built ins?<br /><br />yes, they are quite expensive, although im not sure how they would compare to someone building something out + materials.<br /><br />however, if they fit the space you&#039;re trying to work with, they&#039;ll also be able to come with you when/if you move. further, if you can use a drill and a level, you can install them yourself too. <br /><br />I have a friend who installed built ins into two nooks on either side of his fire place. due to the weight of his book collection, they&#039;ve started to bow and will never look their best. not saying the same would happen with everyone, but it for sure wont happen with vitsoe.

					considering there are like 5 things on the menu you would think they would all be great.<br /><br />the pizza shouldn&#039;t exist. owner, seriously, go to any number of pizza places on any number of e-lists, in any number of neighborhoods in nyc. taste theirs, taste yours. why would you feel comfortable putting yours out into the world? if you want this to be constructive - consider your dough recipe. consider your ingredients. consider your oven&#039;s heat or heat capability. <br /><br />do better. and jackson heights, you have a plethora of good ethnic foods available. stop telling yourselves you want good food, when all you want is boring sub-par american food. you too, do better. <br /><br />

					this issues this time (with the second pour) were that:<br /><br />a - the pitch of the pour wasn&#039;t allowing for proper drainage <br /><br />b - i guess due to a halt in the work, the proper incisions weren&#039;t made to prevent cracking due to expanding and contracting<br /><br />regardless, it was best they re-did everything over. the second pour wasn&#039;t great so it would have been disappointing to stick with it considering how much better it was before all the work.&nbsp;

					There is also the Toys r Us where Costco and Aldi are - but I imagine there&#039;s some clause in their contracts that prevent similar business&#039;s from opening up in or near the same property.<br /><br />Considering the state of the Aldi I think i&#039;d prefer it be a Trader Joes (although that property is kinda small for it)

					Selling this vintage danish mid-century teak hutch. The condition is excellent considering its age. There are no water marks on the wood, there are 4 legs that can be unscrewed or used to give a floating effect. <br /><br />the top door hinges are in perfect condition, and the shelf inside the top portion is removable if wanted.<br /><br />the bottom door opens up from the top to reveal a white platform. one of the screws on the left hinge has overtime stripped the wood so there is a epoxy reinforcement there which means the unit should be opened with care. <br /><br />size / dimensions: 58&quot;x13.5&quot;x37.5&quot;<br /><br />height is including removable 3&quot; feet (ie 34.5&quot; without feet) feel free to email with any questions. cat not included.<br /><br /><img src="http://i66.tinypic.com/2r5uuk4.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/2m46jgn.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i65.tinypic.com/280qwr8.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />feel free to email me @ <a href="mailto:mbaquerizo@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">mbaquerizo@gmail.com</a> with interest or offers
