				We are new to the area and looking for a handyman to do some repair work and also cosmetic work around the house.&nbsp; Mostly light jobs such as painting and hanging curtains.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are also looking for a weekly cleaner to clean our 3 bedroom 2.5 bath home.&nbsp; I keep it clean and tidy, so this would mostly be bathroom cleaning and light dusting.&nbsp; Have products in the home to use.&nbsp; Once a week is preferred.&nbsp;
