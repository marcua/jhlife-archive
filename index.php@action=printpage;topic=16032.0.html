				Does anyone have any thoughts about the Seatide fish market at 95th and Roosevelt or have any other suggestions as to where to buy fresh fish without leaving the neighborhood?

That&#039;s where I buy from. Of course it&#039;s not very convenient compared to a storefront, especially since they tend to run out of stuff if you don&#039;t get there early. And they don&#039;t have a lot of the &quot;standards,&quot; e.g. salmon.

				If you drive, Foodbazaar on Northern (just after Home Depot and close to Steinway) has an excellent fish market where you can get wild caught fish.&nbsp; They have farm raised as well. All and all they have good quality and a wide variety. I&#039;ve been to the place on Roosevelt and thought it was pretty good but haven&#039;t been in quite awhile.

				I second the farmer&#039;s market suggestion. <br /><br />Aside from that, Pacific, on 75th and Bway, has a large seafood selection.

				Pacific is good albeit sometimes chaotic and not the cleanest. They have good deals on salmon and shellfish. Food Dynasty sells flash-frozen bengali river fish - these are good but not very versatile for non-bengali cooking. FoodTown sometimes has specials but be weary of the age of fish there as I have gotten some weird smelling shrimps at times. Greenpoint Fish and Lobster has a new shop in LIC off the Hunters Point 7 stop that I have been to a few times. Pricy but the stuff is incredible quality, very clean and fresh, and sustainably sourced.<br /><br />One of the things I really wish we had here was an independent fishmonger.

				My one visit to Greenpoint Fish and Lobster LIC was disappointing. Paid a massive price for a piece of salmon that was very undistinguished.<br /><br />Pacific is generally good, but has its undistinguished days too. Not bad, just blah.<br /><br />When we moved here many years ago there was a nice fish store on 37th. I still miss it.<br /><br /><br />

				i&#039;ve had good luck with shellfish at pacific, fin fish, a little less so.<br /><br />and i remember that fish store on 37th well. i think it was in the space now occupied by pauglina, or one storefront further west.

				Yes, the vendor at the farmers&#039; market is excellent but it doesn&#039;t help if I&#039;m jonesing for fish in the middle of the week. The couple of times that I&#039;ve been to Pacific I left without buying anything. The quality just wasn&#039;t there. When I see whole fish with extremely cloudy eyes it tells me a lot about what the other products might be like. All the stuff that I&#039;ve seen at the regular super markets always looks really sad, although I did get a decent piece of salmon at Foodtown once.

				talk to the folks at the farmer&#039;s market booth. since they also control the fishing boats, he&#039;s very aware of exactly when things were caught/harvested and has a really good idea of the shelf life. i&#039;ve gotten &quot;you should probably use that today or tomorrow&quot; and &quot;that should last through thursday,&quot; and all have been right on the money.

				In addition to the people at the Sunday Market, I would suggest Midtown Catch if you are willing to leave the area. It&#039;s the successor to Pisicane Midtown Fish, which closed over a year ago. Now, as then, arguably the best fish store in New York.

				And if you&#039;re feeling adventurous, there&#039;s the New Fulton Fish Market. It&#039;s a hell of an experience, and as I understand it members of the public can go. The downside is that you pretty much need to go between about 1:00 am and 4:00 am :)<br /><br />Which is why people tend to find it more convenient to buy from people like Midtown Catch and the Jackson Heights Sunday Market.

				Last I looked they have some fish for sale in the back, but it&#039;s mostly a fried fish joint.&nbsp; It&#039;s not bad for what it is, seems to do a brisk trade, and they consistently get A&#039;s from inspections.

				I like it a lot for what it is. Yoy can get a basket of flounder, scallop and shrimp with fries for $7 and the quality is surprisingly high.
