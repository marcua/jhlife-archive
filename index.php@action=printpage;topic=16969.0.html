				Had a guy knock on my door this afternoon saying he was with Con Ed, wanting to see my bill to verify something.<br /><br />He was pushy, and made me a little uneasy.<br /><br />I think it was a scammer, so I asked him to leave. He said he would be back in two weeks to verify.<br /><br />Have others had this experience? Are these people with Con Ed or trying to get my account number for a scam?<br /><br />Not sure how they get in the buildings..

				No coned person will ever ask for your bill. It&#039;s a scammer - likely a &quot;switcher&quot;<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/customers-fleeced-utility-scammers-article-1.350235<br /><br />I threaten to call the police for trespassing. These guys are scum and criminal fraudsters.

				This has happened in the past.&nbsp; Con Ed confirmed that it was a scam.&nbsp; Don&#039;t open your door. Ignore them.

				They come around in waves every few months. They are scammers - I always tell them &quot;I just called the super&quot; without even opening my door and that usually gets rid of them.

				Try doing a search on this site for &quot;ESCO&quot; which is category of companies that are trying to switch people from ConEd<br /><br />If the search is too cumbersome to do on here, you can do it on Google and limit it to results on this site by typing this into the search box:<br /><br />ESCO site:jacksonheightslife.com<br /><br />https://www.google.com/search?q=esco+site%3Ajacksonheightslife.com&amp;oq=esco+site%3Ajacksonheightslife.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6232j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8

				These guys showed up to our bldg, about 7 or 8 of them. We kicked them out and put up &quot;No Soliciting&quot; signs right after. Next time I see any of them I&#039;m just going to call the cops immediately. I also don&#039;t let anyone I don&#039;t recognize into the bldg and force them to use the intercom. They try to follow people in, easy prey is the food delivery people or someone that is scared of them.<br /><br />I wish people would stop letting randos into the building.
