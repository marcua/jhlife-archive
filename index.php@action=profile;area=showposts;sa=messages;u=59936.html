					It&#039;s interesting to me that one of the tenets of meta-modernism, which is still a developing philosophy, has turned up on Jackson Heights Life. As far as the sex workers are concerned, I am personally fine with people making a living in that way if it is right for them, provided that they are able to set their own terms. I don&#039;t get the impression that that is the case here considering the goons that hang out on 79th and Roosevelt, and the fact that human trafficking and sex slavery is a known problem in Jackson Heights (not to mention Flushing):<br /><br /><a href="https://qns.com/2019/04/jackson-heights-spa-manager-busted-for-sex-trafficking-ordered-worker-to-give-happy-endings-to-clients-da/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://qns.com/2019/04/jackson-heights-spa-manager-busted-for-sex-trafficking-ordered-worker-to-give-happy-endings-to-clients-da/</a><br /><br /><a href="https://pix11.com/news/morning/victim-highlights-perils-of-nyc-sex-trafficking/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://pix11.com/news/morning/victim-highlights-perils-of-nyc-sex-trafficking/</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/jose-peralta/roosevelt-avenue-epicenter-nyc-sex-trafficking-officials-say" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/jose-peralta/roosevelt-avenue-epicenter-nyc-sex-trafficking-officials-say</a><br /><br />To call what happens around here &quot;sex work&quot; is simply not acknowledging that a lot of these women are doing it against their will, or at the very least, that they are not receiving their fare share of their labor. This attitude minimizes the fact that they are not in control of their bodies. No matter your opinion on whether or not sex work should be legal, this really isn&#039;t a difficult concept to understand.

Apple had a recall for on batteries for several of their products and will replace them for free regardless of the age of the product, or whether or not it is still under warranty.

There used to be a place in Park Slope/Greenwood, but I&#039;m spacing on the name. Do NOT go to BestBuy. <br /><br />Given the way that the PMUs work in Apple products work, changing a battery on an iPad (even an early one) isn&#039;t as straight forward as one would think. You really want an Apple authorized repair shop to do this and not one of the hacks around here.<br />

Maybe someone watches a series of crime-scene videos in a neighborhood with boarded-up homes. There’s nothing criminal about boarded-up homes, but now an association has been made. In facilitating this, the app “reinforces perceptions of people’s ideas of crime and fear.” These “notions of ‘disorder,&#039;” she adds, “stoke fear in people and often translate to a 911 call” even when nothing criminal is going on.<br /><br />Citizen can also shift the perspective of longtime residents. Lynn Rinaldi, who has lived in Girard Estates for 20 years, never used to worry about coming home late at night after work at Paradiso, the East Passyunk restaurant she used to own. But she recently downloaded Citizen, and seeing all the crime notifications “created a little bit of anxiety for me,” she says. “I started to say, I’m not going to take my car out after dark; I’ll just Uber if have to go somewhere.” Though she decided to stop checking the app, it’s easy to imagine how Citizen could produce a self-perpetuating cycle in someone else: A user downloads Citizen and becomes more anxious about crime; the person becomes hyper-vigilant and starts calling 911 when something “suspicious” goes on; that, in turn, generates new Citizen notifications, which ultimately makes everyone else using the app more paranoid, too.&quot;</em><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is truth to this, but East Passyunk and Girard Estates in Philly is totally different than Roosevelt Ave. in Jackson Heights. Those are objectively much safer neighborhoods and they don&#039;t have a tenth of the problems that we have here. Source: I have family in Girard Estates and I&#039;m there at least every two months for a couple of days. I walk to East Passyunk for the restaurants or to go to the BOK Building. There is a problem with heroin addicts congregating on Snyder and Broad (the mid point between the two neighborhoods), but the City has actually been doing something to address that issue. I have never felt unsafe there late at night (after 11:00PM), but I have felt unsafe on Roosevelt.

There are too many taxi bars (fronts for prostitution), illegal bars, and simply bars that attract a particularly seedy clientele. People have been complaining about the situation on Roosevelt for years and it is rare that any thing gets done (the last thing in my recent memory is when they cracked down on the dudes handing out the chica cards many years ago. Of course, they did nothing to actually address the larger problem). The Queens County Sheriff could probably make a sweep of the entire avenue from 74th to 110th on liquor license violations alone.

Why do you assume that people who have a problem with the men who congregate and drink themselves into oblivion daily, urinate and defecate on the sidewalk, make lewd comments to women and young girls, and occasionally expose themselves have a problem with these behaviors simply because these men are Latino? Have you entertained the possibility that these behaviors have serious implications for public health and safety, and that these behaviors are generally not tolerated in most societies?<br /><br />3. Why do you assume that the people who have a problem with the the fact that there are at least three of these groups of men between 78th Street and Junction are &quot;colonizers,&quot; which by the way, is a not so veiled euphemism?<br /><br />4. Considering No. 3, why do you assume that members Latin American and South Asian community do not have a problem with the presence of these men? How do you square this assumption with the fact that yesterday I saw one of these men start following a woman, who then started yelling at him in Spanish, drawing the attention of others on the street who also started yelling at the man in Spanish, one of whom I know quite well and has lived in this neighborhood for a long time?<br /><br />Look, I agree with you that the infiltration of national chains, and rising rents are a big problem for the neighborhood, but your logic on this particular issue is seriously flawed.<br /><br />To the person who asked what we should do, our elected officials are basically useless, but call them anyway. Also, make reports to 311.

I like having 34th Ave open and I use it all the time, but there are far more important things to deal with around here. <br /><br />I&#039;m really starting to believe that open streets has become such a hot button topic because it offers an easy way to ignore the larger problems facing our neighborhood, while still making it seem like people are concerned for the well being of the community. If as much energy was directed to the larger problems, we might actually be able to solve them. But NO, wE MusT DiReCt AAALLLL of oUr EnErgY TOWARDS 34th AVE oPeN StrEEEETs!!!!! <br /><br />You know what really causes issues with our quality of life? Bands of drunks on 82nd and in front of the post office, the human trafficking issues associated with prostitution on Roosevelt (this is well documented), illegal bars that operate in the basements on Roosevelt, 37th, and 90th, the increase in gang activity, and the fact that people like to get shooty and stabby above 90th (I know most people here don&#039;t care about that because many of you rarely cross 82nd). <br /><br />I mean, seriously; all of this is going on and the most pressing issue is 34th Ave open streets? Y&#039;all need to get a grip on what&#039;s going on around here. In short, if your main concern is 34th Ave (no matter your position) you aren&#039;t concerned with the neighborhood as a whole.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is an interesting observation. It does appear that the only &#039;safe&#039; topic is the 34th Ave open street.<br /><br />Possibly because the other issues you mention might include immigration and undocumented aspects?<br /><br />And maybe those topics are taboo?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The people who run illegal bars are also running legitimate businesses that are well established, so my guess is that they are here legally. The other things could be a grab bag.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t care about someone&#039;s immigration status as long as they aren&#039;t acting like jerks. Also, the statistics show that the undocumented tend to lay low, and this is in line with my own experience. I think that it&#039;s easier to focus on open streets, which is largely inconsequential, instead of the real problems facing our community.
