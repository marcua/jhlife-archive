				Does anyone know the deal with the airplane noise on certain days?&nbsp; I may be crazy, but it seems that every so often (usually on a Saturday) LGA&#039;s flight plans seem to change, thus directing way more planes right over my apartment.&nbsp; Is this purely wind/weather-related, or is there some sort of&nbsp; schedule I should be aware of?&nbsp; just curious...

				Funny, I was just thinking the same thing.&nbsp; When the first few flew over I kind of enjoyed the sound.&nbsp; Now that they are coming every few minutes, I no longer am.<br /><br />Here is the info about today&#039;s noise. <br />&quot;LaGuardia Airport&#039;s runway 13-31 will be closed for construction work from 12:01 am Saturday, April 19th 2008 until 7:00 am. Sunday, April 20th. As a result, if the wind is from the south during that period, jets will take off over Jackson Heights causing a noise condition. &quot;<br /><br />http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=33087<br /><br />And I think there&#039;s a list-serv you can subscribe to so you will be warned about future runway closings.<br /><br />P.S. I just wanted to note that the irony of your alias &quot;soundslover&quot; did not escape me.

				As a literal Jackson Heights Lifer, I can tell you that I&#039;ve managed to tune them out except at 6 on a Saturday morning!<br /><br />For fun in high school we used to time them using the &#039;rainy weather&#039; runway. Every 90 seconds. I did it again a few months ago. Every 90 seconds. Thank goodness the 21st century hasn&#039;t improved on that.<br /><br />Now if they would only put in another runway NOT over this area.<br /><br />And where is the Port Authority money for the airport impacted area, huh, Helen?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Sorry for the mixed thread.

				I live in the Dunolly and this morning at 6am I woke up to what sounded like a plane taking off on 34th Avenue. I finally got out of bed at 7 and since then have been jotting down the time when each plane take off. They&#039;ve been taking off every two minutes since 7am.&nbsp; I&#039;ve called the Port Authority airport noise complaint hot line to file a complaint.&nbsp; If anyone else if motivated to call here is the number 718-533-5615.&nbsp; In typical NYC fashion its an automated system.<br />&nbsp;:tickedoff:

				The flight pattern is different today.&nbsp; I called LaGuardia and the sweet (NOT) woman who answered said &quot;call the FAA, here&#039;s the number&quot;.&nbsp; So I called and FAA said call airport directly and ask for noise complaints.&nbsp; So I called back and asked and sweet lady said &quot;there is no department like that.&quot;&nbsp; Then she hung up.&nbsp; <br /><br />good public relations!

				Thanks I called. I don&#039;t anything will happen.&nbsp; I would just like to know why the flight pattern is different today: Shea Stadium game, tennis at Flushing Meadow etc. etc.&nbsp; There&#039;s usually a reason when flights get diverted.&nbsp; You would think someone would be able to answer that.&nbsp; But NOOOOOOOOOOOO such luck.

				Occasionally certain runways are closed due to special events, but more often it&#039;s due to runway construction or maintenance work.&nbsp; <br /><br />CB3 has a page dedicated to this topic here (http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=33087), but it doesn&#039;t show anything for this weekend.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how often it is updated.<br /><br />There is apparently a notification email list for this (click here to subscribe) (http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/page/5561/index.v3page?a_v=sub&amp;s_v=sub&amp;s_rt=WGList&amp;s_rid=15251&amp;ss=p$3D5561), but I&#039;m not on the list so I can&#039;t vouch for its reliability.

				I&#039;ve lived here for 8 years, so let me try to be helpful about the airplane noise issue.&nbsp; Every other summer, on weekends -- and this is that summer -- LaGuardia shuts down one of its runways for maintenence.&nbsp; That means some of its planes have to take off over land rather than over water (as they usually do) and this means noisy take-offs.&nbsp; There&#039;s no point complaining or calling political officials or complaint lines.&nbsp; They can do nothing.&nbsp; This is strictly an FAA issue.&nbsp; And though it&#039;s annoying, it needs to be done.&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, most of you do fly and I&#039;m sure you want to depart from well-maintained runways.&nbsp; It ain&#039;t pleasant, but learn to live with it.&nbsp; Or try to leave the &#039;hood on those alternate summer weekends and visit other parts of the city or Nepal.....

				ToddG, I wholeheartedly agree.<br /><br />In Jackson Heights, this seems to happen maybe once every three months.&nbsp; When I used to live not more than a mere 20 blocks away in Woodside, this seemed to happen 3 times every month.&nbsp; It is much better over here, and I grin and bear it because if need be, I could walk to the Airport to catch a flight.<br /><br />It&#039;s nice to finally get an explanation as to why this happens because of runway construction... now I&#039;m somewhat curious as to why it&#039;s so bad in Woodside.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any insight anyone???&nbsp; My only recollection was that it seemed to coincide with storms just offshore.<br /><br />

				Yep. This morning&#039;s been bad. It&#039;s the first time since we moved two months ago that I&#039;ve really noticed the airplane noise inside the apartment. It actually woke me up this morning (well, that, and the brown GMC suv outside my window that&#039;s had it&#039;s alarm going off and on since at least 6).&nbsp; <br /><br />My parents live along the Potomac across from DC, just a few miles north of Reagan National Airport, and they&#039;re on the landing path daily - it&#039;s so bad that they can barely use their terrace. It&#039;s actually a surprise to me to be so close to LGA, and yet only once in two months have I heard the planes like this.

				Yes it was,since about 6:00am on,yesterday. They switch take off/landing patterns often. The planes that were taking off yesterday morning veer east and then north.

				Great link - thanks!&nbsp; <br /><br />In the replay of yesterday, and comparing with this morning, I can see why I was hearing the planes all day yesterday. This morning&#039;s takeoff pattern instead has the departures heading out over the water and Flushing Meadows park, whereas yesterday they were taking off heading south and turning around - pretty much directly over my building.

				Hi All,<br /><br />I have lived in JH for about 5 Years (74th and 35th) on occasion I would hear the planes, but it never really bothered me as it was usually on rainy days... but last year I moved (73rd and 32nd Ave) and BOY OH BOY! was I surprised when the entire living room lit up one night! I thought the plane was headed right for the house.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the weekends when the flight path is changed they go over the house ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT LONG. <br />I think this is more so during the warmer weather. I remember trying to host my bookclub meeting in the yard over some BBQ last year and we could hardly hear each other. <br /><br />Thanks for the links below...now I will know when and when not to use host an outdoor event!<br /><br />

				Airplanes rarely departure over Jackson heights â€“ the most 24h/ month. However, they tend to land over Jackson Heights fairly frequently â€“ on average 24h/week. Of course, taking off planes make 10 times more noise than landing planes.

				i live on 82nd bet 37th and 35th, and noticed something changed the other weekend. i called the airport traffic information system for pilots and there was a note about birds north of the airport. it did not directly state that this was the reason for taking off on runway 22 (south over the neighborhood) but it made a lot of sense because the winds were not strong. i&#039;m somewhat speculating but as a pilot (non commercial) myself in lieu of increasing bird populations and flight 1549, it&#039;s something we may have to consider seeing (or shall i say hearing) more of in the future.

				Maybe this is just me, but besides the issue of noise, it seems really ill-advised for airplanes to take off from LaGuardia Airport&#039;s shorter runway in the direction of land. There is almost no chance for a pilot to abort a takeoff without it resulting in a potential disaster for the flight&#039;s passengers and crew, but also for dozens (if not hundreds) of civilians. If the plane does not achieve liftoff and overshoots the runway, it ends up plowing into the Grand Central Parkway, and if it does get airborne for even a few seconds and stalls, it potentially falls into one of the densely-populated neighborhoods of western Queens. <br /><br />I&#039;d really like an explanation from the LGA management as to why takeoffs over land seem to be happening on a regular basis every Sunday now.

				Thanks for providing that info n5460n. I agree with you StevenGrey that using a shorter runway as opposed to one over water seems foolish. I heard the noise as early as 7:30AM yesterday and thought I&#039;d go nuts. Usually when work is going to be done (and therefore flight plans will be changed) the Community Board is notified, but no one from Laguardia has contacted them. I called the CB to complain and they said they&#039;ll pass along the issue to their manager. They couldn&#039;t have been nicer, but I was only the second person to complain. If you want to let them know you&#039;re hearing planes too see this link for their contact info: http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=1627 .

				I am not an expert on why they would do this. The bird suggestion was pure speculation based on the little bit more information I may have. Air traffic control professionals make real-time decisions based on years of training and supervisors who call runway changes do it based on years of experience.<br /><br />Without knowing the reason behind the switch, it is preposterous to call an ATC decision &quot;ill-advised&quot; or &quot;foolish&quot;.<br /><br />Please disregard my speculation if this is the conclusion you come to with respect to the people managing thousands of lives on arriving and departing our neighborhood.<br /><br />On a personal note, I don&#039;t really mind the noise.<br />

				Today the airplanes were taking off in the opposite direction over the water. LaGuardia airport has been around for 70 years.

				There are two places you can look for runway maintenance and closure updates:<br /><br />http://www.adcnynj.org/AirportUpdates.html<br />http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/airports/html/lg_construction.html<br /><br />The Aviation Development Council, which runs the first website, also notifies Community Board 3 about upcoming runway closures that may create noise conditions in the neighborhood.&nbsp; CB3 used to pass on these announcements to community members via a notification list (http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=33087), but that doesn&#039;t seem to be active anymore.

				Yes, these links tell you about special circumstances that affect take-offs and landings.&nbsp; But what about just an average day?&nbsp; It would be so much more bearable if LaGuardia let us know when and for how long a certain landing pattern will last.&nbsp; Today, the landings started at about 6:00am.&nbsp; Will they last all day?&nbsp; Until noon? Until late at night?&nbsp; There&#039;s seems to be no way of finding out.&nbsp; It&#039;s sort of like being stuck in a traffic jam.&nbsp; You can&#039;t do anything about it, but you just feel better when you have an idea of how long it&#039;s going to last.&nbsp;

				Dear v70cat,<br /><br />I usually won&#039;t engage in arguments online, but since I was just called out for a comment I made back in March, I felt I needed to reply. Thanks for providing the link to the history of LaGuardia Airport, as the wikipedia article will help me illustrate the point I was trying to make 9 months ago. <br /><br />You are quite correct, LaGaurdia Airport was built well before I was born in 1966. But as the section of the wikipedia article subtitled &quot;Later Development&quot; points out, LGA is too small, too busy, and its runways are too short by modern standards for a commercial airport located in the heart of a metropolitan area. If you continue reading the next section, entitled &quot;Accidents and Incidents&quot; you will note that in my lifetime, there have been FOUR major accidents, ALL of which occurred on TAKEOFFS from the airport, the most recent of which was US Airways Flight 1549 back in January. <br /><br />My posting back in March was not a complaint so much about airplane noise, but about the wisdom of using runway 4/22 for takeoffs over the densely-populated neighborhoods of Woodside, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, as opposed to the other direction, if possible. And how dare you have the nerve to criticize my comment AND then ask for construction to be delayed until 9AM on weekends! (Which emoticon is most appropriate for &quot;hypocrisy&quot;?)&nbsp; :coolsmiley:

				Steve, you raise a good point about safety, however I believe take the direction of take off is influenced by wind direction. It was not meant as a attack, I was just using your words from your post, however it was directed at you instead of the &quot;big bad officials&quot;. <br /><br />I find this site and others related to JH are littered by entitled &nbsp;people that recently moved here and since they are here, they want to things to change! &nbsp; Now some change is good and the community can benefit from the help of its new members however I find that it is very easy for people to complain and be entitled and do nothing in the end. &nbsp; The Airport is vital to the City &nbsp;and for or for bad it happens to be in our back yard.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the early Sunday morning airplane noise and was suggesting that might be a reasonable/constructive &nbsp;compromise for all. <br /><br /><br />

				I apologize if the tone of my earlier reply was a bit nasty, but I said nothing in my original post about wanting LGA closed. In fact, in another thread I reminisced about spending many a Saturday during my childhood watching the takeoffs and landings from the observation deck at LaGuardia. And I love the fact that now I can jump on the Q33 and be at the airport in about 12 minutes. For the record, I was raised in Woodside and attended both P.S. 11 and St. Sebastian&#039;s, so I am quite used to the sound of commercial airliners passing overhead every few minutes. And while I may have only moved to Jackson Heights two years years ago, my cooperative apartment was built a dozen years BEFORE the airfield that would eventually become LaGuardia Airport, and therefore -- technically, my home WAS here first! ;D<br /><br />Now to get serious for a moment... there&#039;s nothing I can do about how you feel regarding the &quot;entitled&quot; newcomers to Jackson Heights, but trust me, as someone who has lived in other parts of this city, JH has one heckuva LONG way to go before it becomes &quot;gentrified.&quot; We&#039;d all be well advised to be a little more respectful to one another and not start accusing people of being elitists or racists because they express a certain opinion about street vendors or trash collection, the local homeless, or even about the types of business establishments they currently patronize or would like to see in the future. Given the current economic outlook for our city and state, we&#039;d all be better off working with each other than at cross purposes. End of sermon.&nbsp; :angel:

				I have noticed planes landing at LGA - is Jackson Heights on a flight path for the southern runway?

				planes that are landing are usually relatively quiet, since they&#039;ve basically completely cut their engines by the time they&#039;re a mile or so from any airport...it&#039;s the takeoffs that rattle windows and give people agita, and those usually go out over the bay and make life hell for the people of college point. weather can and does impact the patterns (wind direction and speed more than rain or snow).<br /><br />the incessant honking? sigh. if only that could be fixed. it&#039;s gotten bad enough at my corner (35th and 76th) that i kinda want to buy one of those old fashioned air-horns to squall back at drivers..&nbsp; :angel:

				95db is loud, and if it was a steady, constant noise, it could cause hearing damage after a few hours. For the few seconds every two minutes or so that we reach that volume it&#039;s not likely to cause any damage...it&#039;s just really, really annoying at 6 AM.

				The real problem is that the airport is on the water. When visibility due to fog or similar conditons gets bad they opt for the over JH route in to land. This can also happen i suppose when there is heavy traffic too. Then the special events like US Open come into it as well. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much that can be done about it.<br /><br />There were times as a kid that I swore i could see a stewardess, maybe even her pearls.

				in all seriousness, this re-routing takes place 2-4 weekends every 2-3 years. i&#039;ve lived in jackson heights since 1996 and in western queens since 1989. it&#039;s pretty much like clockwork, and it will probably happen again in 2012 or so. you learn to live with things like this for the good of the larger community -- and thank goodness we don&#039;t live in the real takeoff pattern, where we would get this noise the other 358 days a year.

				Dear Community - we are wondering if something has changed with the flight patterns over LGA? It seems flights are being re-routed almost every weekend now, flying over us at 6am, and it is driving me nuts. It used to be that this would happen once or twice over the summer due to the US Open or re-paving runways. Now it seems it has happened almost every weekend for the last 2 months. I can&#039;t find any info about this anywhere, and last time this was posted about in JH Life seems to be a couple of years ago. Anyone know what is going on? Info appreciated! Also - let me know if there is a different area of the site this topic should be posted to.

				Thanks, I had already read that indexed thread, but it was from 2008 and seems out of date now. The community board&#039;s link to the LGA page for construction alerts is a dead link. I decided to post because things seem different now, ie more frequent flights over the neighborhood. I mainly want to know if this is a short-term change, like for the months of Feb and March, or if this is a more permanent change, and was wondering if anyone new anything current.

				memories aside, airplane noise has been a lot worse and more often lately. definitely more than the occasional rerouting. and since it starts at 6 or 7 am&nbsp; on weekends and continues the entire morning, it has been a nuisance to say the least. i hope the madness stops soon.

				Hi All, <br /><br />My first posting...... has anyone noticed an increase in the amount of very loud noise from airplanes flying directly overhead?&nbsp; Today is Saturday and I&#039;ve been up since 7am, beautiful day, windows wide open and the planes have been soooo loud and so frequent that I&#039;ve had to increase the volume on the TV when I was watching a show.&nbsp; <br /><br />Who do I contact to complain?&nbsp; Has anyone else noticed an increase?&nbsp; Anyone have a logical explanation?<br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />KatieB (Dunolly Gardens)

				hi katie :)<br /><br />this topic gets posted every year or so....mostly by folks who are new to jackson heights.<br /><br />every year (or two), laguardia needs to do runway maintenance, and planes get rerouted to take off over our paths, rather than land. it happens for two, three, maybe four weekends every summer, year in year out. nothing we can do about it.<br /><br />i&#039;ve lived here 15 years and gotten sort of used to it. but just to warn you, this will probably be the state of affairs tomorrow as well.<br /><br />just imagine if you lived in, say, college point, where this is the noise they get every day!<br /><br />

				Was anything else going on, maybe today? The plane noise sounded a little unusual (but nothing that striking or I would have been more cognizant earlier) and when I got to the 90th Street 7 station for my morning commute in, there were two very small planes flying in very close formation that were traveling north to south, then circled back towards LaGuardia and dissappeared. I hesitate to say &quot;combat air patrol&quot; since I haven&#039;t heard THAT sound since 9/11, but it looked to all intents and purposes like a routine fighter screen...maybe it was military folk going back to base after Memorial Day fly bys?<br />

				In reference to the fighter planes, it is most likely due to the Memorial Day holiday. I know yesterday in College Point we saw two fighters fly over since the Mets have fly bys before the game on military holidays. They may still have been in the area and are now going back to the base.

				Actually, this has been happening a lot more often lately. It&#039;s not just the couple-of-times-a-year-runway-maintenance, more like once a month, sometimes even every 3 weeks. I started keeping a log of the 6am flyovers precisely because it&#039;s been getting worse than I&#039;ve ever known it (I&#039;ve been in JH for about 10 yrs). I tried calling 311, they had no clue how to record it. Katie, did you have any luck with your complaint?

				I&#039;m going to have to agree with divanatrix and dssjh. <br /><br />LGA was here long before us, even those of us who have a lifetime here. There is only so much that can be done an then no more. As dssjh pointed out the other options are not real options. I remember a time when the noise was much worse. <br /><br />I am in a position where I am dealing with travelers every day. Whenever I am asked which airport is closest to Manhattan I explain that things here are measured more in time than distance. In other words, La Guardia, JFk and Newark are more or less equal in convenience. In this way I try to discourage more LGA traffic. LGA is already overburdened and with short runways and no room for expansion. <br /><br />Of course I myself prefer to use LGA because i am here in JH. Those of us who can make suggestions to travelers aught to help n this way, small effort as it is, to distribute traffic. It may not solve alot of problems, but what if everyone wanted to use LGA?

				I filled out the online complaint form.&nbsp; It is more difficult to find information on Port Authority websites about changes in flight patterns that impact noise in the community.&nbsp; I found link through FAQs section.<br />I understand we live near the airport, but the noise levels and frequency do seem to be increasing In the past the PANY website had specific information on construction/runway closures so you knew when to expect airplane noise. Now it seems every Saturday at 6 am it starts.&nbsp; Perhaps the complaints in Bayside and other areas shifted more flights over our skies...maybe it is worth putting in more complaints to get noticed...

				<strong>Petegart</strong>: the links have been above.

				First I would say there is a group that chimes in just to hear the sound of their keyboard and not only don&#039;t add to the conversation, but think their snark responses are clever.&nbsp; First off&nbsp; LaGuardia hasn&#039;t been here for ever and does have to respect the neighborhoods it impacts.&nbsp; I wonder how these people responded when the USTA imposes fines on airplanes flying overhead during matches.<br />Secondly the issue the rerouting of planes, to unfairly impact some neighborhoods, thus bringing down the value of people&#039;s property.THe fact that the NYT wrote an article on this subject shows that those people who keep posting here with nonsense or the &quot; just move&quot; meme need to ignored.

				Actually LGA has been here forever. Pterdactyls used the marshes first - and man followed. The airport was originally in North Beach, aka East Elmhurst. I remember during WW2 going over there to meet my dad when he came home from trips.<br /><br />The &#039;rainy weather&#039; runway - over the Woodside station, bisecting Astoria Blvd at a really low height, and on to land, is pretty noisy. But the noise we are hearing it the taking off over that route. This is something to do with the Doppler Effect, I think. Google it.<br /><br />When I was in HS in the &#039;50s we used to time the planes during boring classes. They averaged 90-120 seconds. I think that is the same still which when they take off is why it seems continuous.<br /><br />I know this doesn&#039;t contribute to the conversation in any positive way, but 65 years of this, REALLY makes me want to invest in new/replacement Triple Glazed Windows!!!<br />

				Yes, I&#039;d agree that there are those who just type meaningless phrases like &#039;stay silent, lesser being.&#039; but they can be excused: manners are not expected in some classless circles. <br /><br />I do have to ask the question that so angers some of my peers here. What is the solution? Complaining is wonderful. It is what Americans do best. But if you complain about an issue like this, you need to present an alternative or risk sounding like a crackpot yelling at kids to get off your lawn.<br /><br />And, for the record, I don&#039;t believe the neighborhoods that bear the brunt of the noise the majority of the time are suffering drastically depressed property values -- our regular<br />RE agent posters would know better than I do, of course.<br /><br />P.S. I hate six am roar as much as anyone. But horn honking is a bigger noise issue for me.

				<strong>dssjh</strong>, you are ignoring a solution that I offered: they could reroute planes back to their old routes (that do not fly above Jackson Heights).<br /><br />As to how it affects property values, a comparison with other areas that already suffer with noise is incorrect. You need to compare it with Jackson Heights itself. House prices go down if an area start to have problems that it didn&#039;t have before.<br /><br />Now here&#039;s the link for you to file a complaint:<br />http://www.planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9/<br /><br />ps. You can complain about the car noise as well! If this doesn&#039;t work, you can take the issue to 311, the police etc. There are a few options.

			<dd class="postbody">
				Below, a message from Daniel Dromm about airplane noise that arrived in my email:<br /><br />Dear Neighbor,<br />&nbsp;<br />Recently, our neighborhood has been subject to an excessive amount of plane noise at all hours of the day and night as well as on the weekends. Even while trying to celebrate and honor the life of Father Eugene Donnelly a couple of weekends ago in East Elmhurst, I found myself having to compete with and wait for the planes to pass before we could continue the street co-naming ceremony.<br />&nbsp;<br />In 2012, without notifying the public, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began testing a program called Next-Gen, a system that uses global-positioning technology to precisely track planes and allow air-traffic control to safely reduce the distance between them, allowing for more frequent landings and takeoffs. The FAA quietly completed an environmental review of its tests and, I believe wrongfully, concluded that the program would not have any significant effect on the quality of the environment (including noise pollution). The FAA then made the changes permanent.<br />&nbsp;<br />The result is that while NetGen reduces emissions and flight delays, new low flight patterns disturb more Queens residents. This apparently was not taken into account. To make matters worse, the FAA quietly introduced a new rule that will allow them to make future changes to flight patterns without conducting environmental reviews to study the impact of the changes.<br />&nbsp;<br />Along with Congresswoman Grace Meng, Congressman Steve Israel, Congressman Joseph Crowley and a host of elected officials, I am pressing the FAA and the Port Authority to prepare a full environmental review of flight changes, as it has been done at most other U.S. airports. Also, our congress members sent a letter to the FAA calling on the agency to exempt LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy Airport flights from the new rule that allows the FAA to make changes to flight patterns without environmental impact reviews.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the meantime, there are a few things residents can do to let the &quot;powers that be&quot; know you don&#039;t like this new pattern:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write to Governor Cuomo and ask him to sign the Part 150 Bill (A7697/S3841), requiring the Port Authority to prepare a Noise Compatibility Study for JFK and LaGuardia Airports. This has been passed by both the Assembly and State Senate. These studies have been done in more than 50 other airports around the country.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete and submit a complaint form to the Port Authority here or leave a detailed voicemail on this hotline at 1-800-225-1071.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make complaints to the Port Authority and email a copy of the complaint to Bob Whitehair of Queens Quiet Skies for statistical purposes atqueensquietskies@aol.com.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work with civic organizations and elected officials towards the installation of more noise monitors at LaGuardia, where there are only 4, and JFK where there are only 6. At most other major airports, there are 30 noise monitors at each airport.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocate for the creation of an Aviation Roundtable, where decisions are made by all affected parties: citizens, airport personnel, the airlines and the FAA - as found in 25 other locations around the country.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the near future, I will hold a Town Hall meeting to bring residents together to discuss other ideas about what can be done to decrease this assault on our quality of life.<br />&nbsp;<br />I believe that with our efforts and working united as a community, we can push the FAA to listen to our concerns and work with us to resolve this matter. <br />&nbsp;<br />Please feel free to contact my office if you have any questions at (718) 803-6373 or email me at dromm@council.nyc.gov .<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Sincerely,<br />￼<br />Council Member Daniel Dromm<br /><br /><br />***<br /><br />To write to Gov. Cuomo:<br />http://www.governor.ny.gov/contact/GovernorContactForm.php<br /><br />To complain with Port Authority<br />http://www.planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9/<br />or 1-800-225-1071

				Does anybody know how often this new route is going to be used?&nbsp; Once a week?&nbsp; Every day?&nbsp; When I first moved to the neighborhood less a year ago, this was still very infrequent, perhaps once a month.&nbsp; Now it seems to be multiple times a week.&nbsp; Is there anywhere to go to find out what exactly is in store for us in the long term?&nbsp;

				Thanks for the clarification.&nbsp; So this is why the planes sound crazily louder than ever.&nbsp; They are lower.<br /><br />This is not a healthy way for anybody to live.&nbsp; And I guess folks will be fleeing Queens (perhaps not by plane)...if it continues.<br /><br />Already on weekends when I hear the planes early in the morning...I quickly plan my escape from Jackson Heights to the acceptable din of Manhattan or Brooklyn...only these days to sometimes return to Jackson Heights in the evening to the sound of planes still roaring...<br /><br />Not a good situation.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				My guess is the closer one is to Woodside approx 63rd Street...which is where the planes are non stop landing....(every 30 secs)... the louder the roar is....<br /><br />What do others conjecture?<br /><br />

				that&#039;s a fairly precise point, JIF, and i think it&#039;s about right.<br /><br />the real noise, however, seems to come into play for takeoffs, which is what we get on those weekends. if you stand on, say, 35th and 72/73/74, you can see planes landing pretty often -- but they&#039;ve always cut their engines, so the noise is lessened by a huge degree. i live on 35th in the 70s and experience that pretty often.

				I was walking along Broadway and got to 63rd street recently...and that&#039;s why I know it&#039;s where the flight path is.<br /><br />The engines certainly weren&#039;t cut off...and it was loud as hell.

				I live near the landing path for the runway 4 arrivals, and with the engines largely idling at that point it&#039;s a light and very tolerable roar. If I&#039;m in the yard it actually bounces off the backs of the houses opposite and sounds like it&#039;s coming from the east before the planes appear over the rooftops to the northwest.<br /><br />However the southbound takeoffs are awful and usually occur starting early Saturday mornings. They&#039;re rare, but jeesh.

				Thanks to all who posted the appropriate links to more info and filing a complaint. I know that in the past I sort of blew off the disturbance with proposing earplugs, but the past week or so has been exceptionally bad--the noise just seeps through my earplugs now, that&#039;s how much. It seems like the planes are flying lower than before and are back-to-back throughout the entire day. Been feeling like I&#039;ve been flying back and forth across the country myself (I&#039;m a bit closer to the airport than others in JH, so maybe I&#039;m getting it worse than others).

				It is true, this past week or so, the landings have been over western Jackson Heights every day (including this morning)&nbsp; We live on 34th Ave and 73rd street and the landings here are quite loud, engines &quot;cut&quot; or not...&nbsp; We now gave up and installed $1000 citiquiet windows in the bedroom which keeps the noise down so long as you keep the windows shut..... The landings may not affect those in the east, but a large swath of Queens, including Woodside, and certainly Elmhurst north of Northern Blvd are affected.&nbsp; Being an unwilling expert on the landing route for the past 5 years, I agree the planes seem to be lower, thus a bit louder.&nbsp; We have resigned ourselves to the noise, LGA has been here much longer than most of us, but I don&#039;t know how much longer we can live here, only for that reason.

				The plane noise has seemed better this week to me as well.<br /><br />On a similar note, the honking on my street has increased dramatically since they removed the &quot;no honking&quot; signs.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that would make any difference but I don&#039;t think I am imagining that it&#039;s gotten a lot nosier.&nbsp; <br /><br />But Mr. Softee seemed quieter this summer!&nbsp; Maybe he knew I was getting ready to start throwing eggs out the window at him.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the initial post on Dromm&#039;s letter and his call to action.&nbsp; As residents and business/property owners in JH, we are all stakeholders, regardless of whether we have been for one day or decades.&nbsp; Indeed, it is incumbent upon each of us to take concrete steps to improve the quality of life in the neighborhood, rather than adopt a laissez-faire attitude like a flock of sheep waiting to be slaughtered.&nbsp; While the link has been shared many times before, I would urge everyone to flood the system with complaints:<br /><br />http://www.panynj.gov/contact/contact-us.html<br /><br />And, as for the trolls monitoring this thread and don&#039;t understand what good complaints would do, I honestly don&#039;t have time to give you a basic class on how a representative democracy works.&nbsp; <br /><br />Go JH!

				Here comes Solomon. <br /><br />Dssjh, of course you are right that it&#039;s unreasonable to expect all airplane noise over Jackson Heights to cease, and that it would not be equitable to force other neighborhoods to take on the entire noise burden. But I assume you do agree it&#039;s gotten a bit worse lately? It sounds like you do. And without the ability to be in every neighborhood at once, it&#039;s impossible for any of us to know whether the change is an appropriate rebalancing or an unfair burden placed on Jackson Heights. So people complain and write letters to the Port Authority, Danny Dromm, etc. I think the complaining is understandable, and the letter writing is potentially effective.<br /><br /><strong>That said</strong>, I would note that this thread may itself be as big a threat to property values as the airplane noise. People who consider buying property here look at Jackson Heights Life all the time, and this thread could, I think, easily scare some of them away. That doesn&#039;t mean the thread shouldn&#039;t exist. But, as someone else said above, let&#039;s ease up on the over the top comments, try to be as realistic as possible about how bad it really is, and maybe consider writing letters to people in power as a more effective response than venting emotions on JH Life. My perspective: I&#039;d say the noise is worse than it was, and worse than in neighborhoods that are nowhere near airports. But there are certainly neighborhoods with a lot more noise than we get, and I think there&#039;s a decent chance political action can help roll back some of the increase in plane traffic over our neighborhood.<br /><br />

				solomonic reasoning is quite welcome!<br /><br />I know people in college point, and one person in a part of the Bronx that gets a lot of takeoff noise from LGA. the former group are relieved to have their noisy-day quota lowered (from about 95 percent of days to about 80 percent). according to info I&#039;ve read, they have not added flights to the airport -- although there has been talk about adding another flight or so every three minutes, which would make things worse. it&#039;s just been something of a rebalancing of the hefty number of flights that currently come in/go out of the airport. is it bad for some of us -- including me? yep. should we just flip the bird to other new Yorkers, as newbies like lifeofpi suggest? nope.<br /><br />I was deeply involved in protesting late &#039;90s plans to increase air traffic at LGA and would do the same again. it&#039;s overused, overcrowded, and, frankly, dangerous. but I do believe that mindless NIMBY bleating -- as opposed to rational discussion and legitimate protest-- should be ridiculed.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=9191.msg52019#msg52019">Quote from: PA on October 19, 2013, 05:52:17 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Here comes Solomon. <br /><br />Dssjh, of course you are right that it&#039;s unreasonable to expect all airplane noise over Jackson Heights to cease, and that it would not be equitable to force other neighborhoods to take on the entire noise burden.

				I still don&#039;t understand why there is absolutely no noise from planes on many days (you&#039;d never know we lived near an airport) and yet on other random days like yesterday, you hear the planes all day.&nbsp; In the past, the plane noise would happen due to a runway closure and the re-routing of the planes.&nbsp; But now supposedly the noise is due to Nextgen and a new system of allowing more planes to fly?&nbsp; If this is the case, then why are there so many days with no noise?

				I remain convinced that the problem -- yesterday was horrible -- is due to runway rerouting, not additional planes. <br /><br />the takeoffs over our neighborhood are either once every 60-90 seconds or non-existent. that&#039;s clearly a runway closure issue. if it were merely more planes, we&#039;d have a barrage of takeoffs every three or so minutes, six to midnight, seven days a week, since that is LaGuardia&#039;s schedule.<br /><br />we had a break during the week, had a horrible, horrible Saturday, and have silence today. this may be the way it goes. honestly, i&#039;d rather have five quiet days and two really bad ones than seven days a week where we share the noise evenly with everyone else. and, yes, I am ruling out the option of having 100 percent of planes avoid flying over Jackson heights 100 percent of the time.<br /><br />let&#039;s see how the fall and winter play out before we all panic, sell our homes and move to Rockville centre.

				In the past it was easy to find runway closures/re-routing information on the Port Authority airport websites.&nbsp; For some reason they don&#039;t seem to provide this information so readily.&nbsp; It would be great to know why on some days the airplanes shoot directly over us, and thankfully most days it is quiet.&nbsp; Is it too much to ask our good neighbor LGA to provide better information about flight patterns.&nbsp; I guess I would rather know ahead when to expect it....than fear the unknown.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				My understanding is that to accommodate the increased flights out of LGA...(60% increase)<br />the new flight path system requires the planes to fly lower (louder) and more frequently.<br /><br />Initially Bayside was targeted...but they complained...and now we (and others) are the ones suffering.<br /><br />My guess is that the FAA is fully aware that the airplane noise is unbearable (illegal?)...and that is the reason only 4 noise monitors are installed for all of LGA.<br /><br />If the noise can&#039;t be measured...then it doesn&#039;t exist... and they don&#039;t need to account for it.<br /><br />My conjecture is that we are being hoodwinked by the FAA...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				You&#039;re also misreading the Delta release.<br /><br />Delta increased its flights by 60% because it took over most of US Airways&#039; operations at the airport. The increase in Delta flights was accompanied by a reduction in US Airways flights. Delta in exchange gave a bunch of DCA slots to US Airways. Delta and US Airways TRADED slots, they didn&#039;t ADD slots.<br /><br />The increased noise we&#039;re hearing over JH is because of rerouted flight paths, not many more aggregate&nbsp; flights.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=9191.msg52049#msg52049">Quote from: dssjh on October 21, 2013, 12:26:39 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Jif, I read the linked release and noted that it was written two years ago.

				The situation is fast becoming unbearable.<br /><br />I find myself plotting how to flee Jackson Heights...to visit friends in Brooklyn or Manhattan as soon as I hear those planes start roaring...<br /><br />Flights from LGA do not cross Manhattan, no doubt because the FAA is fearful of the power of some Manhattanites. Now, to me, the sound of mere traffic and ambulance horns is like a philharmonic symphony concert...compared with this nerve-jarring airplane noise.<br /><br />I believe the only possible solution is to make our protests heard in public. The complaints utilizing those links to authorities and the governor... are CLEARLY not achieving results... <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think it&#039;s been every 45 seconds since about 9am.&nbsp; It started at 6:00 am yesterday (I was already up) but it wasn&#039;t as often or as loud.&nbsp; Is it just me or does the noise seem louder today?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />My apartment is too hot when the heat is on but I had to shut my living room window; it was just too much.&nbsp; <br /><br />but primetime, having noise on Sundays is nothing new.

				Huh? Not to disagree with you, but I&#039;ve lived here 6 years but never remember hearing it on Sundays. It was always Saturday (every 3 months or so) starting exactly at 6am. Then it evolved to every Saturday at 6am. Now I just noticed it at 9am this morning. Regardless, this is just too much. Like the other reply, I may have to sell my apartment and flee Jackson Heights. Such a shame.

				Suggestions to fix the problem:<br />1. Revert routes and number of flights to the as they were before Jan. 2013.<br />2. LaGuardia, Port Authority and the FAA should create a website where flight route information for each day is immediately accessible.<br />3. In case flights are reverted for weather or maintenance, the reason should be posted on the website.<br />4.

A complete environmental impact should be done to record current noise situation.<br /><br />These are just a few basic steps.<br /><br />If none of these works, a nice option: close LaGuardia Airport and turn it into LaGuardia Park.

				number 6 is just about impossible, since business travel is dependent on morning flights, and number 1 difficult, since, as I&#039;ve suggested here before, there are just as many people in other neighborhoods demanding that they not get planes routed over them. the others are all things that should be fought for, no question.<br /><br />i mean, it stands to reason that people in the areas to the east and north of LGA are doing the same thing as we are, and that they are just as in the right in wanting a moratorium. right?<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9191.msg52203.html#msg52203">Quote from: abu benuska on October 27, 2013, 09:33:22 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Suggestions to fix the problem:<br />1.

				It could be useful to have someone from Jackson Heights attend the meeting that COMET (the Communities of Elmhurst and Maspeth) are having with the Port Authority to address the plane noise issue on <strong>Wednesday, November 6th at 7:00 pm</strong> at Maspeth Town Hall, 53-37 72nd Street.&nbsp; (Unfortunately Wednesday nights are not good for me.)<br /><br />Perhaps this would give us a heads up about what to expect if Dromm is able to arrange a meeting for us as well.<br /><br />http://www.cometcivic.com/newsletter.html

				For those who missed the Maspeth meeting on Airplane noise, here&#039;s some news coverage:<br /><br />AIRPLANE NOISE COMPLAINTS AIRED;A TOWN HALL MEETING IN MASPETH BRINGS GRIEVANCES ABOUT LAGUARDIA<br />Queens Chronicle<br />http://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/airplane-noise-complaints-aired/article_026cf1a8-0b0f-522c-bf3b-dedde8d1b39f.html<br />by Laura Shepard<br /><br />All over Queens, residents say that increased plane noise is affecting their quality of life. However, the neighborhoods of Maspeth and Middle Village have not been known to have this problem because they are located south of LaGuardia Airport, away from departing routes.Representatives from the Port Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration sought to address the community’s complaints at a Maspeth Town Hall public information meeting hosted by Assemblywoman Marge Markey (D-Maspeth) on Nov. 6.Nevertheless, longtime resident and civic leader, Roe Daraio says her windows shake and the planes fly so low “it’s as if they’re going to land on our roof.”<br /><br />Joyce Franceschina says that she can smell jet fuel on a regular basis.Mark Guiod, an air traffic manager for the FAA, said that the most frustrating thing about his job is that people keep asking him what has changed. “Nothing’s changed,” he said. “the only thing that ever changes is seasonal weather patterns.”“Weather doesn’t just happen on Saturday,” one resident replied, referring to the noise that woke up many people in the area shortly after 6 a.m. the previous weekend.Ed Knoesel from the Port Authority informed the community that one runway was closed for maintenance while the taxiway was repaved and that this will not be a pattern.Richard Doyle lives in Elmhurst and said the plane noise has never been loud enough to wake him up, prior to June. He believes that the noise has increased because the flight path for arriving planes has shifted about 10 to 15 blocks east. He claims that the planes used to fly over the western end of Maspeth, which is industrial and commercial, rather than the residential area, which is on a hill.<br /><br />Daraio and Franceschina’s houses sit on the Maspeth plateau, which is seven stories above sea level at its highest point, giving residents an unobstructed view of the Manhattan skyline.<br />Daraio, who has lived in Maspeth for 38 years, said that she invited neighbors over to eat in her yard, in previous summers.“This summer, I couldn’t have anyone over. I never went through this ever before. I don’t know why you’re saying you didn’t change anything when I can’t hear my neighbors a few feet away,” she said.Guiod explained to the meeting NextGen, a highly sophisticated computer system that lets pilots follow a defined path, in order to optimize efficiency, while maintaining safety in the nation’s most complex airspace.<br /><br />Some residents described the frequency by which the planes arrive as one after another, every 20 seconds or so, but Guiod accused them of exaggerating because a plane cannot land until the previous plane has landed and turned off the runway, which takes about a minute and 45 seconds.“I would give the air traffic controller an award if he can move planes that fast,” he said.Middle Village resident Len Santoro said that since 2008 the planes have been flying lower over his home late at night, to the point where he can’t keep his window open. Santoro said that he once complained to the Port Authority and was told that planes do not fly below 3,000 feet over his home.“I find that very hard to believe,” he said.Former United pilot David Williams described a typical descent into LaGuardia Airport at the meeting. He said that planes approach the city over Prospect Park at 2,500 feet, cross the former Maspeth tanks at 1,500 feet, find the expressway and descend at a three-degree glide, which is preferable to flying low.<br /><br />A resident asked Guiod if the noise in Middle Village and Maspeth is a result of the departure procedure, which has planes take off south and turn east to fly over northeast Queens, but he said that’s not the case.Knoesel, told the community that all four noise monitors around LaGuardia Airport will be replaced with new ones, which will monitor real-time noise, to ensure that arriving and departing planes do not exceed the limit of 112 perceived noise level in decibels.He noted that this has been the limit since the 1960s and that airlines that exceed this level at JFK Airport are hit with a $250 fine, but there is no penalty at LaGuardia. Neither the PA nor the airports can change this discrepancy because the fines are enshrined in federal law, he noted.Knoesel said the agency will now calculate noise contours, or the average noise in an area, annually rather than every five years.<br /><br />The agency is updating its website to display flight noise, decibel levels, runway closures and flight tracking in real time. Knoesel said they aim to have the new website up by December.<br />The complaint system has also been integrated and now consists of a toll free number, (800) 225-1071 and a form is available online at planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9.<br />Markey said that she will ask Borough President-Elect Melinda Katz to use the Aviation Advisory Committee to serve the community.Meanwhile, Carmine Gallo, the FAA regional administrator, is forming a roundtable, which will include community representatives, but Guiod does not know when this will happen.<br /><br /><br />_________<br />BETTER AIRPLANE NOISE MONITORING SYSTEM TO COME TO BORO: OFFICIALS<br />Times Ledger<br />http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/46/maspethplanes_tl_2013_11_15_q.html<br />By Bianca Fortis<br /><br />Queens is getting a new system for monitoring noise from area airports, officials from the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey said last week.State Assemblywoman Marge Markey (D-Maspeth) called a meeting Nov. 6 at Maspeth Town Hall for officials from the Port Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration to address longstanding complaints about noise from airplanes flying into and out of LaGuardia and Kennedy International airports.Residents came from Woodside, Middle Village, Maspeth, Elmhurst, Woodside and Jackson Heights for the meeting.Edward Knoesel, manager of the Port Authority’s environmental services aviation department, announced a new Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring System is in the process of being implemented throughout the borough.<br /><br />Knoesel said the new system will provide more accurate and current information and the data logs will be available within 24 hours. The old system has a four-day lag time.At the end of the year, a public website will be launched that will track flights, monitor noise decibel readings, provide runway closure announcements and allow city residents to file noise complaints, Knoesel said.The Port Authority will keep 10 years of data that have been obtained through the old system.Members of the community say airplane noise pollution has been louder, lower and more frequent than in the past, especially over the summer.Roe Daraio, president of Communities of Maspeth &amp; Elmhurst Together, a civic group, said at times the planes are so loud they sound like they are about to land on the roofs of homes. She has experienced her house vibrating, she said.“Our windows shake,” she said. “By 1 o’clock, I’m taking aspirin — and that’s when I’m in the house with my windows closed.”Some residents said that they have been awakened late at night because of aircraft noise.Knoesel said there are no restrictions to what time a plane can fly, although airlines generally operate the planes between the hours of 6 a.m. and 12 a.m.Over the summer some airlines choose to land later flights if the flights have been delayed, according to Mark Guiod, manager of the FAA’s New York Terminal Radar Approach Control. Some land as late as 2 a.m.<br /><br />Knoesel said residents all around Queens suffer from the noise. Authorities must balance complaints along with maintaining operations of the airports that are part of the busiest airspace in the world, he said.He said La Guardia airlines are beginning to replace some older, louder planes, which should help address the noise issue.“The geographical area of who is being exposed to and experiencing that noise is shrinking, it’s getting smaller,” he said. “The planes are changing out, and these planes are a lot quieter than what they used to be. There’s no more 707s, there’s no more 727s — those things were really very, very loud.”To log complaints, call 1-800-225-1071. Complaints can also be submitted through planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbf9.Information about Queens Quiet Skies, a nonprofit that advocates for relief from airplane noise for all Queens residents, is available at queensquietskies.org. The group can be contacted at queensquietskies@aol.com.<br />

				I agree.&nbsp; The authorities seem to refuse to acknowledge that the planes flying LOWER...due to their new system...even over a more &quot;defined path&quot;... leads to plane noise being far louder over a greater diameter circle of residential area on the ground.<br /><br />This appears to be where the disconnect is. <br /><br />They never factored that in...and so are pretending it doesn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />J

				and the FAA rep&#039;s claim that flights are spaced at least 1:45 apart is laughable. you don&#039;t have to be a queens resident to know that, you just need to have been on an airplane at LGA or JFK and watched the takeoffs and landings from a few feet away.

				JIF, I&#039;m confused.&nbsp; If most of the noise is caused by landings and takeoffs, how could Staten Island (for example) share the pain? They aren&#039;t even near the airports.&nbsp; I feel like I&#039;m not understanding something.

				Yes. Staten Island is too far.<br /><br />But if you look at the map...the planes currently go thro the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn...<br /><br />For instance Little Neck, Queens (and Bayside) is affected by plane noise...by the descent landing route...to LGA...<br /><br />Manhattan, which is far closer to LGA than Little Neck or Bayside, Queens...&nbsp; could be on the ascent/descent routes as well...but the Transit Authority excludes Manhattan.<br /><br />I would like to know exactly why. I&#039;m guessing why.&nbsp; But it&#039;s conjecture. And I would like them to be scrupulously honest.&nbsp; (The policy-makers live there, perhaps?)<br /><br />For fairness of noise distribution it&#039;s not just the actual landings/take offs that are noise producing...it&#039;s the ascent/descent which due to NEXTGEN is lower than previously...and thus creates far creater noise for us on the ground.&nbsp; <br /><br />Previously the planes flew higher with their ascents/descents... and that created less ground noise. (Makes logical sense)...<br /><br />They are flying lower so they can squeeze more planes in. Less time between take-offs/landings.<br /><br />As you might imagine, there is a pretense that NEXTGEN a better system...but MONEY is behind it.<br /><br />Which we on the ground are paying for...in noise.<br /><br />Though Manhattan isn&#039;t!<br /><br />NEXTGEN is better to make more money for airlines/airports.&nbsp; NEXTGEN is worse for us suckers.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				At Monday night&#039;s meeting the powers that be (Port Authority and FAA) indicated that the takeoffs over Jackson Heights occur when the main runway is down for construction or repairs, or perhaps weather issues, as it might have been this morning.&nbsp; The runway used for takeoffs over Jackson Heights is typically used for landings, the ones that descend over Woodside and then East Elmhurst.&nbsp; The main runway mostly flies over Flushing, and they will likely bear the brunt of the NexGen &quot;improvements.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In &quot;normal&quot; years, the takeoffs over JH were usually limited to about 6 weekends.&nbsp; This year - like about five years ago or so - the number of weekends seems to have doubled.&nbsp; Hopefully the frequency will return to the &quot;normal&quot; level in 2014.&nbsp; Although I left before the meeting ended, I don&#039;t think they plan to permanently re-route takeoffs over us, but we certainly need to stay vigilant.&nbsp; The good news is that it seems as if the Port Authority and FAA realize that they can no longer proceed without input from the surrounding communities.

				I have noticed that the dull roar is now pretty much a constant here in Jackson Heights. Most days.<br /><br />Like I keep trying to explain...it&#039;s due to the planes flying lower...even though not on top of us...in the distance... because of the new NEXTGEN GPS system...which allows planes to fly lower...and squeeze more landings/take offs in...<br /><br />I am guessing that we are stuck in between the noise from low flying landings from Woodside...and low flying take- offs thro Flushing Meadows...and so we hear a constant rumble...in our skies.<br /><br />This is my conjecture. And these days it&#039;s pretty much full time.<br /><br />It is a question of MONEY.&nbsp; AIRPORTS/AIRLINES are making more money out of this.&nbsp; Simple to understand, really.

				I live in East Flushing, and have been dealing with the same issue (NextGen) over the past two years. It is heartbreaking to see this destructive airline practice suck the life out of my neighborhood. People have started wearing those big ATC headphones in the park. I live 6.5 miles from the LGA runway axis (by flushing cemetery)and it is still awful. Kids can&#039;t grow up normally in this environment now.<br /><br />Folks, this all about increasing airport capacity. LGA is at maximum output when JH gets arrivals on R-4/22 while Flushing/Bayside gets departures on R-13/31. This formation alleviates congestion at the runway axis and can be implemented anytime winds are below a certain threshold (which is just about every summer day). When winds pick up out of the northwest in the fall, we start getting a few breaks. Flushing gets the low impact arrivals over FMCP, and departures go out over the river, thus avoiding JH. The airlines hate this, as it reduces capacity and causes delays. <br /><br />Check out PASSUR.com to verify. It tracks flights in real time on a map. West, Northwest and Southwest winds above 10 knots are our friend. <br /><br />Also, there is a new airport advocacy group called the Global Gateway Alliance. It is funded by Jared Kushner and Joe Sitt, real estate tycoons. They have already lobbied the FAA to avoid studying NextGen and have no trouble swaying reporters and journalists exactly what they wish to have written. They cite &quot;NextGen&quot; advocacy as there primary mission. They are very slick, and could care less about Queens.

				<br />Airplane noise and runway plans announced<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />From the Forum:<br /><br />Queens residents living around the borough’s two airports may not have to suffer through the same kind of noise they have in the past for much longer, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week directing the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to launch a multifaceted approach to addressing the issue that has long plagued area denizens.<br /><br />&nbsp;As part of the governor’s request, the Port Authority will also be stepping up the review of noise data with the Federal Aviation Administration.<br /><br />&nbsp;The agency has said its overall goal is to address noise concerns while supporting growth at JFK International and LaGuardia airports, which annually generation billions of dollars in economic activity and wages and support hundreds of thousands of regional jobs.<br /><br />“Airport noise is rightly an important concern for residents of Queens, the Bronx, and Nassau County, and that is why I am directing the Port Authority to open a full and thorough dialogue with the impacted communities while also pursuing a noise study to better address the issue,” Cuomo said in a statement. “We will listen to local residents and ensure their input is used to make both JFK and LaGuardia airports better neighbors.”<br /><br />The initiative to mitigate noise includes the Port Authority commencing community roundtables with FAA officials and community representatives in April for both airports. The gatherings will also include elected officials and will be held on a regularly scheduled basis.<br /><br />&nbsp;From the Times Ledger:

				I submitted as well.&nbsp; There was an hour this morning when it was a frequent as 1 plane every 45 seconds (yes, I timed it).&nbsp; Sadly, this is not something that a regular noise machine can resolve.

				I heard it when I woke up in the morning til about 3 or 4 pm, which is when I went out for the rest of the day.&nbsp; When I returned in the early evening, there was no more noise.&nbsp; I agree that the frequency did let up some during the day, but I think it let up around 12:30ish and was more tolerable in the afternoon.&nbsp; I am located in the 80s streets.<br /><br />No noise at all today!&nbsp; :)

				At least it looks like the right people are talking about the issue. Maybe relief isn&#039;t far away.<br /><br />FIRST AIRPORT NOISE ROUNDTABLE IS HELD;RESIDENTS MEET WITH PORT AUTHORITY AND FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION<br />Queens Chronicle <br />by Laura A. Shepard, <br />For the first time in New York City history, representatives of the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey and the Federal Aviation Administration joined representatives from surrounding communities for a roundtable discussion on the noise and other impacts of flights arriving and departing from LaGuardia Airport, on Monday night. “Governor Andrew Cuomo made clear his concerns about aircraft noise in communities surrounding JFK and LaGuardia airports and that’s why we’re here tonight,” Ralph Tragale, the Port Authority assistant director of aviation, said. “He’s directed us to take some aggressive action.” The governor issued the executive order on March 24, almost a year and a half after Queens Quiet Skies formed to advocate on behalf of the people whose homes are bombarded with constant plane noise to the point where it was disrupting their conversations, activities, sleep and overall quality of life.<br />The first meeting was largely dedicated to presentations on the status of the airport itself and discussions about the functions of the roundtable and the direction it will take. <br /><br />At the moment, the schedule has not been determined and the members have yet to agree on bylaws.QQS President Janet McEneany laid out the basics. Some core tenets are that roundtable members must represent entities or groups with a stake in aviation, operate under written bylaws signed by all members (except the FAA, which is barred by federal statute) and follow a work-plan to address specific issues in committees, McEneany said.“Roundtable members — this is a very important principle — they agree that we will not shift noise from one community to another,” McEneany said. “Roundtables all over the United States have found ways to get rid of the noise.”Queens Quiet Skies recommended forming one roundtable for both JFK and LaGuardia Airports, but the Port Authority chose to form two, one for each airport, but Tragale said that if there are many overlapping issues and the members of both groups support it, the Port Authority will consider consolidating the two.<br /><br />Roe Dario of the COMET Civic Association also supported one roundtable as communities like Maspeth are subject to noise from both airports, she said.The Port Authority and the FAA are adding staffers and hiring consultants to conduct a three-year, $3 million study of noise impacts and possible mitigation measures.The Port Authority is doubling its noise monitoring program and will work with the roundtable members to find locations for the new ones, especially in communities that currently do not have any. If more are necessary, the Port Authority will add them. There are permanent noise monitors at the end of runways so that the Port Authority can inform the airlines when their departing planes violate noise limits and portable monitors in surrounding communities, which look like mini fridges with a microphone atop a tall pole that must be placed in otherwise quiet residential areas.<br />The roundtable will also ease communications between the communities and the agencies, as there has been a lot of confusion in the past, since the Port Authority operates the airports, but the FAA dictates flight patterns.<br />“There was always a lot of misunderstanding about what the airport operator does and what the FAA does,” Tragale said. “Sometimes they were at a meeting, sometimes we were at a meeting and people felt they were getting the runaround. This meeting does a lot to establish that we’re both going to be here and you can respond to both of us equally in front of each other so there can’t be any finger-pointing.”<br />The Port Authority also revamped its website to make it easier for people to register complaints by simply typing in their address and hitting a complaint icon. This will enable the Port Authority to compile data over time and make appropriate changes.<br />Rosemary Povoromo of the United Community Civic Association was also there on behalf of several politicians and expressed her hope that the roundtables “will not just be venting sessions to tranquilize the masses.<br />“LaGuardia Airport is our immediate noisy neighbor and we who live in northwestern Queens have suffered its ongoing assault on our quality of life for decades, not only from heart-pounding, earsplitting noise from the thousands of arriving and departing jetliners, but from jet fumes belched from its thunderous engines and both these assaults must be coupled when addressing airport negatives and both if at all possible must be neutralized,” Povoromo said.<br />“We don’t run these airports to detract from the quality of life, we do it to improve the quality of life,” Tragale said. “The airports are a very important economic generator, the airports provide a lot of jobs and a lot of economic benefit to the city, but it’s very important to us that they be good neighbors and I think we’ve made a lot of progress over the years, but we obviously have some work left to do and that’s why we’re starting these roundtables.”<br />http://www.qchron.com/editions/western/first-airport-noise-roundtable-is-held/article_e643e780-ffef-5a1e-8f8c-fc5a8956e828.html<br />

				I put in my complaint.&nbsp; I always do so because sometimes I think they are testing us to see how much noise we will tolerate.&nbsp; If we don&#039;t complain enough, maybe they will add more days that the planes go over our neighborhood.&nbsp; At least today is not AS bad as some other Saturdays in the past have been, since the frequency is a bit less, meaning one plane every 4 minutes instead of every 90 seconds.<br /><br />There was one weekend when it happened two days in a row and the planes were coming every 90 seconds and I thought I would go out of my mind.&nbsp; (In the end I had to leave the apartment to regain my focus.)

				the only surefire remedy is closing LaGuardia. there are only so many directions planes can take off, and we get roundly annoyed and deafened one or two mornings every few weeks. that&#039;s inconvenient, agreed. very. people in college point get it more often, as do people in maspeth and a few other places. i guess we could close the airport for a few years and build only runways that take off over the water. but when wind patterns change, so do flight patterns.<br /><br />i&#039;ve been chastised here numerous times -- particularly by lifeofpi, who&#039;ll be here momentarily -- for asking, but where DO jackson heights residents suggest planes take off from (besides Newark, that is)?

				Complaint submitted.<br /><br />But I&#039;m confused as to why this happens over our neighborhood. The planes take off down the southwest-ward runway of LGA, and then have to bank <em>severely</em> to the east to head over Jackson Heights. What could be the cause of this? Other than to give the poor Woodside people a break for the day? It can&#039;t be a closed runway or weather, as I&#039;ve seen suggested. Does anyone know if the Port Authority has ever explained exactly why this air traffic pattern is necessary?

				It allows them to increase the number of landings and reduce fuel usage. Yes it&#039;s worse in the 70s. I am I&nbsp; the upper 80s and while I can hear the planes I don&#039;t take cover every 30 seconds. I honestly feel for you guys under this pattern, it&#039;s incredible.&nbsp; While the airport is near, we don&#039;t live next to it.

				Yeah is almost 10 pm, and the plane still flying loud and none stop. This is first time I experienced this since I moved here. I been in our neighborhood all days today. As I walk from 74th to 89th st I heard and saw a plane per block. The odd think I noticed is most are taking off, kind of surprise they will flew toward south...I will think is mostly landing. I wonder if they are circling around in the air waiting for landing.

				When these intermittent pattern changes are in effect, the planes we hear in the mid 70&#039;s are ALWAYS planes taking off.&nbsp; They are revving their engines to the max in order to get altitude (which is to be expected) which is part of the reason the noise goes right into your bones.&nbsp; Perhaps there are other noise issues elsewhere in the area concerning planes landing at a lower altitude, but that is not what we&#039;re experiencing here.<br /><br />They fly right over our building starting before the sun is even up.&nbsp; Often they are going every 45 seconds.&nbsp; It&#039;s ridiculous.

				the spacing is ridiculous. i think it is every 45-60 seconds, and, yes, it&#039;s the takeoffs that are the worst. i&#039;m on 76th/35th and we get planes banking over our building when it&#039;s this pattern. on landing days, i can see the planes clear and close, but the noise is not nearly as bad. <br />

				We had to crank our somewhat diesel soundbar under the TV up yesterday morning just to watch it and be able hear dialog.&nbsp; I recall backing the DVR up a couple times due to not being able to hear what was said.<br /><br />I guess this is their way of saying GET OFF THE COUCH AND GO OUTSIDE. :)<br /><br />It&#039;s funny when we first moved here 5 years ago it hardly ever happened. Then it only happened on Sunday mornings when we had someone crash for the night, had to explain it&#039;s rare :P. It&#039;s definitely been much louder and more frequent in the last year or so.<br /><br />It stinks for those that did some research to try to situate themselves somewhere that wasn&#039;t affected by it.<br /><br />At the least it&#039;s not happening every day, I see them passing over the neighborhood by the Waldbaums every time I go over there, that has to be horrible. But in retrospect, when you go look at an apt/house over there you know what you&#039;re getting into because it happens all the time, there&#039;s no way you can miss experiencing it.<br /><br />Solution, I have no idea. <br /><br />EDIT: It seems it only happens on the weekends. I&#039;ve never heard it on a weekday except maybe an extremely rare occurrence. Perhaps they shoot them over Woodside during the time everyone is at work and crap on JH over the weekend when everyone is home.<br /><br />Or they are working on runways over the weekends. Seems strange though that it&#039;s only weekends. I would buy the wind change theory if that wasn&#039;t the case. Wind only changes direction on the weekends?

				I heard one about 5:45 which was pretty loud.&nbsp; I found this on Boeing&#039;s site.<br /><br />http://www.boeing.com/commercial/noise/laguardia.html<br /><br /><br />*************<br />AIRPORT CURFEWS<br />Aircraft operators are requested to voluntarily not schedule flights between the hours of 2400 and 0700.<br />PREFERENTIAL RUNWAYS<br />0600-2200 Takeoff - R/W 13 Landing R/W 22 <br />2200-0600 Takeoff - R/W 31 landing R/W 22<br />****************<br /><br />Now it says &quot;voluntarily not schedule flights between&quot; Midnight and 7am.&nbsp; That&#039;s not an explicit ban on takeoffs, just departures. Potentially there was a midnight flight which got delayed for 5 hours due to last night&#039;s rain, and when they had a clearing around 5:00/5:30 they took advantage of the opportunity.<br /><br />The site also says the preferred takeoff runway for that hour is 13.&nbsp; Not sure if that points our way or not, but that might explain this morning.&nbsp; <em>***Edit/Addition:&nbsp; 13 faces Northeast not our direction, again &#039;Preferred Runway&#039; not &#039;Mandated Runway&#039;&nbsp; Weather factors may have prevented 13 from being utilized***</em><br /><br />Not necessarily defending LaGuardia here.&nbsp; I get just as upset when I hear one every 3 minutes about one weekend a month, but when I lived in Woodside, I remember it being far worse, and someone will get upset no matter what direction they take off and land in.<br /><br />One of the inconveniences of living in an area where you&#039;re able to walk to the airport (or at least get a real cheap cab) is going to be noise.<br /><br />

				It has started to become a HUGE problem. It degrades the life of everyone living in Jackson Heights. Weekends is more pronounced because peple stay at home.

				@ buzz: i remember it being an annoyance longer ago than that, but they&#039;ve REALLY ramped up the number of flights (at all airports), so it&#039;s a lot worse the last 15 ish years.<br /><br />and it did happen in astoria when i lived there back in the late 80s. not so much where i lived (near broadway), but up closer to the water -- i had a friend who lived at the end of steinway, and it was pretty brutal a few times a year.<br /><br />i agree about filing complaints, but as i&#039;ve said before - and gotten shouted down - i really wonder what can be done....planes have to leave LGA, and there&#039;s no way for them to leave without flying over residences, whether it&#039;s us, college point, the bronx, astoria... there needs to be amelioration, but i don&#039;t think we&#039;ll ever get rid of the problem completely.....until we have aircraft that can blast straight up like rockets.

				&quot;What do we hope to accomplish by complaining?&quot;&nbsp; What seems like a jerky question really is a good one.<br />1) As tax payers we have a quality of life issue which means we aren&#039;t woken up at ungodly hours- <br />2) Despite the many complaints and the community forum — the PA hasn&#039;t done anything to alleviate the situation ( well what did you expect when they were so snarky)<br />3) While I am a renter I can move, there re many residents whose property values are being diminished due to this.<br />Just because it is a busy airport — we don&#039;t have to take it, there is a body of water right next to us they can fly over.&nbsp; I just came back from a holiday in Munich which also has a very big international airport - they don&#039;t have this problem.&nbsp; <br />Perhaps we need Danny Dromm to call the PA back here for another forum - this time with better answers than the ones they gave<br /><br />The people of Howard Beach&nbsp; took on the PA with the SST and won so this can be done

				Hi All, this is my first post here. We are thinking of moving to Jackson Heights but reading all these threads about airplane noise has made us really worried. Based on the recent posts it seems that the problem continues. We&#039;ve been to the area 5-6 times but only during the day/afternoon, and I don&#039;t remember hearing/seeing any planes. Is there problem worse on some streets? What time of the day and where should we visit to get an idea of how bad it is? Is it bad enough to keep you from moving to Jackson Heights if you were not already living there? Thanks!

				that last question is super subjective: i moved here from astoria in the mid &#039;90s anied knew i was moving close to an airport -- and having grown up about the same distance from another major airport, i knew about what to expect in terms of noise. that said, it has gotten a bit worse since i moved here.<br /><br />&nbsp;we live in the standard landing pattern, and landings are quieter than takeoffs (the engines are cut by the time they get here). but with the increase in flight frequency (which can be changed) and the changeability of weather patterns (which cannot), i&#039;d say problems occur about 10 or so weekends a year, versus three or four weekends a year a few years back.<br /><br />the issues tend to occur on weekends only. and very early. i&#039;ve never heard it last all day, but the 6 am to noon or so can be bad. i live on 35th and 77th, and the takeoffs bank pretty much directly over 76th/77th/78th. i think that may be the worst. people who live in the low 70s seem to notice it less. and the further north you go -- towards LGA -- the worse it is. near northern seems the worst.<br /><br />i think it&#039;s an annoyance, but not enough to make me consider moving.

				P.S.

				We moved to Jackson Heights about 3 months ago and are very happy with the decision.&nbsp; It is a wonderful neighborhood with an involved community.&nbsp; The fact that we can discuss this issue in this forum demonstrates the investment people are making in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Anyway, I agree with some of the other posts that the truly problematic plane noise occurs about one Saturday morning per month.&nbsp; Someone told me that on those mornings the airport is repairing the more frequently used runways.&nbsp; Once the work is done the planes return to taking off or landing on runways that impact Jackson Heights much less.&nbsp; I have no idea if this explanation is accurate but it is consistent with the pattern of noise.&nbsp; If this is the case, maybe the airport could do repairs overnight or on a different day while more people are at work?

				By looking at the Webtrak of the plane noise (http://www.panynj.gov/airports/webtrak.html). In Jackson Heights, at least for me, it will never be a good idea to live around the flight path (just imagine a line connecting 61st street/Roosevelt ave to the north-south runway of LGA). If you are waiting the 7 train on the platform of the woodside-61st 7 subway station, very often you can literally see the plane just flying above your head directly.<br /><br />Due to the expensive real estate of NYC, whatever properties on the market will always sell as some people will have to sacrifice what ever they don&#039;t like for a lower price or for a shorter commute or for a large space. <br /><br />

				the thing is, if you minimize impact on jackson heights, you maximize impact on college point. if those folks complain, we divert flights over throgs neck/other coastal bronx areas. once they rally, the planes come back to jackson heights. there&#039;s no feasible way to operate this airport without flying planes over residential areas. if it were sub-teterboro in terms of usage, maybe that could work, but everyone who has a dog in this fight wants the planes to fly strictly over someone else&#039;s backyard .....

				this debate is going to go on forever. some people think living right next to an airport will result in airplanes flying overhead. some think that&#039;s outrageous, some think it&#039;s fine, some -- the group i fall into, as does one of our kind admins -- think it happens a dozen or so days a year and can be dealt with. some things are certain: airplanes will continue to use LaGuardia, everyone in every neighborhood around the airport will shout that the planes should take off over one of the other neighborhoods and not theirs. until we have aircraft that blast straight up, the planes have to go somewhere.<br /><br /><strong><em>[Moderator&#039;s Note: This discussion is getting long, so we&#039;re going to start a fresh thread here (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=13397.0)]</em></strong>
