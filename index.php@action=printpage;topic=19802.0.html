				I see Orchid is closed and the one on Roosevelt and 78th is also. Other than Table Wine, what else is open. Tried calling Broadway Wine on 74th Street and Broadway, no answer

				Have you checked Colony Liquor on 86th St/37th?<br /><br />Also, this might be out of the way for you, but Northern 89 Liquor posted a few days ago that they have new hours, so I&#039;m assuming they are still open.<br /><br />&quot;We are temporarily changing our Business Hours.<br />Mon 11 am - 10 pm<br />Tue 11 am - 10 pm<br />Wed 11 am - 10 pm<br />Thu 11 am - 10 pm<br />Fri 11 am - 11 pm<br />Sat 11 am - 11 pm<br />Sun 12 noon - 8 pm.&quot; --Northern 89 Liquor

				Colony wasn&#039;t answering the phone yesterday, so i resorted to MiniBar delivery. it&#039;s actually not bad, price wise and delivery is fast -- they source from a place in Sunnyside and normally deliver within an hour of order being placed. Yesterday, it was about two hours.

				Thanks so much, I have my order coming between 3-5, in time for cocktail hour. I notice that stuff like vodka takes a few days to deliver? I wasn&#039;t sure how that works.<br />

				I placed order at Astor wine 3 weeks ago, and they delivered a week later. Not sure what is the backlog now. Is free delivery if you order over $150 I think. Or $99 for first time.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure if Table Wine is keeping their regular hours, but they have a good system in place. Just call them.<br /><br />If that fails, call Patsy Stone!<br /><br />(http://home.bt.com/images/joanna-lumley-136399150142426903-160430003010.jpg)

				I saw a sign in the window that said it was temporarily closed.

				Colony has been open. They don&#039;t deliver.<br /><br />The one on Northern/89th may be out of the way for some, but there is a plexiglass wall between the shoppers and the cashier, which I used to think was weird but is now a plus in these strange new times.

				The only liquor store that is currently open (its 2:15 pm) is the one on Roosevelt &amp; 78 St where I just returned.&nbsp; Closed is Orchard, Broadway &amp; 74th St &amp; the one on 73rd Road next to Kebab King.&nbsp; I&#039;m on 77 St so I&#039;m not familiar with Colony on 37th Ave &amp; 86 St.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Orchard may have been open this morning but not at 1:45.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />
