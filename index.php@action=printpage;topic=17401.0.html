				This morning 79 street was cordoned off and there were multiple police cars. I checked the citizen app and it stated that there was a possible suicide. Anyone hear anything?

				I was wondering if anyone has heard anything further regarding this incident.&nbsp; With all the gangs connected to the park I&#039;m wondering if&nbsp; it wasn&#039;t gang related violence.
