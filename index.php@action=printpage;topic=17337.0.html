				For the past half hour a drone has been circling the neighborhood. Can they do this ? We r very close to the airport. It doesn&#039;t seem safe. Plus it was very loud!

				I came here to post something about this! How do you know it was a drone? It was so loud that it seemed like a helicopter to me, but I couldn&#039;t see anything from my window.

				It was definitely an NYPD chopper, it was circling around Travers for a while with a spotlight. Obviously they were looking for something.<br /><br />Not to be snarky, but I&#039;m really confused how anyone could think that was a drone.

				The following pic and message were tweeted last night from the 115th Precinct&#039;s Twitter account.&nbsp; Maybe they were searching for this guy?<br /><br />&quot;<em>We need your help finding this individual.&nbsp; He is wanted for an assault occurring in the confines of the @NYPD115Pct.&nbsp; If you have information as to his whereabouts please call 800577TIPS.</em>&quot;<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/39cAlkR.jpg)<br /><br />

				Oh. I don&#039;t know where people get their info--where did someone see that they were looking for an elderly missing person? That actually doesn&#039;t seem so likely--would they deploy helicopters for that purpose? I kind of doubt it.
