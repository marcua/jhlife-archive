				This was posted yesterday on curbed. At these prices, I think it would be easy to look past the fact that the 7 train is outside of your window.<br /><br />(http://ny.curbed.com/uploads/40-07-73rd-Street1%20qstoner.jpg)<br /><br /><em>&quot;New rental The Roosevelt at 40-07 73rd Street—situated near the borders of Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Woodside, which are apparently the new hottest neighborhoods—has released six units earmarked as affordable housing. At market rate, the 31-unit building, which launched in October, has been leasing its convertible two-bedrooms from $2,400 and three-bedrooms from $3,600, but the affordable units start at $860/month. Each full-priced unit has two bathrooms, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a small outdoor balcony. The building has on-site laundry facilities and an elevator.&quot;</em><br /><br />(http://ny.curbed.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-07%20at%2010.30.53%20AM.png)<br /><br /><em>&quot;The Roosevelt&#039;s six affordable units are asking $860 for the one one-bedroom available and will start at $1,146 for the five two-bedrooms. The Department of Housing and Preservation is conducting a lottery (warning: PDF!) via NYC Housing Connect, with eligible residents from Queens Community Board 4 receiving preference for three of the six units. Those applying must make within the income range listed above, and entry into the lottery is open until February 25.&quot; </em> <br /><br />http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/07/new_queens_building_opens_lottery_for_six_rentals_from_860.php#more (http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/07/new_queens_building_opens_lottery_for_six_rentals_from_860.php#more)
