								<div class="inner" id="msg_51836">Can&#039;t believe I happened on this website trying to glean some info on St.Joan Of Arc grammar school.&nbsp; I have spent 2 days soaking in everything that is on this site, soaking in all these wonderful memories. My husband &amp; I are both from JH, went to school, hung around &amp; eventually got married at Our Lady of Fatima&#039;s, when it was still a Quonset Hut.&nbsp; My husband went to PS 148 and lived on 89th between 32n &amp; 31st avenues.&nbsp; He then went to Bryant HS. He has always talked about stickball, victory gardens and the &quot;Lots&quot; &amp; of course as he grew older, the bars on Northern Blvd. I was born in a one family house on 32nd ave between 86th &amp; 87th std until we moved to 32-04 82nd st. right off northern blvd and below the Fire House that was on he Blvd.&nbsp; All of the movie houses mentioned hold fabulous memories.&nbsp; I remember pushing my sons in their carriage on 82ndSt and meeting all my girlfriends and chatting for hours.&nbsp; My mom bought my wedding dress in Clarks and I remember shopping with her at Fields and Marie Sheridans shop.&nbsp; I also remember going with my mom each month to a toy store with creaky floorboards so that she could give the man behind the counter a few dollars.&nbsp; The store was Gerstenharbers and the monthly money she gave him was to pay for our Xmas toys payable over the course of a year.&nbsp; I went to St. Joan of Arc and I think I too graduated in 1952.&nbsp; I remember Sr.St.Catherine as being very beautiful and Mary-like in her features.&nbsp; I never had Sr.Carmelita, but my brother did and I have memories of my mother having very unkind things to say about her due to some problem she had with my brother.&nbsp; I remember Fr.Boyland and his beautiful snow white hair, and Fr. Mooney being on the short side.&nbsp; I remember going to Fr. Lenahan for confession &amp; making sure I was on his left side as he was deaf on that side !!!&nbsp; I also remember my mother having an argument with Sr. Dunellen, the principal at the time &amp; the school secretary, Mrs ? being very nice. I also remember many, many girls in my class throughout those 8 years. I also remember graduation day and the name of my graduation partner as we walked down the aisle in St.Joan&#039;s.&nbsp; We were married in August 1958 in the Quanset hut of Our Lady of Fatima. The priest that married us was brand new, his name was Fr. Waring and he was very, very nervous as it was his first marriage ceremony.<br />Does anyone remember the Tune Timers on Northern and 82nd st, next door to the Toddle House? Flanagans Bar across from the Boulevard movie...McDonalds Bar on Northern Blvd. next door to the funeral parlor of the same name? McCallions, also on Northern..the Belevedere Bar, the FoodFair, Henry Joost&#039;s ice cream parlor, which just happens to be the place I met my husband at when we were 18 &amp; 19 yo?<br />Bitter sweet all these memories from sooooo long ago,&nbsp; but at least I can still remember them so vividly. I had a baby in Physicians &amp; two in Booth Memorial Hospitals &amp; later on, after we moved, one daughter in LI Jewish.<br />Anyone on this site have some of these memories ... would love to continue reading about those wonderful days !</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_51862">Hello fellow &quot;OldTimers&quot;...I lived in Jackson Heights from 1938 until I married in 1958, had three boys and moved to Springfield Gardens in 1968, just before my 4th child was born. We lived in a 6 family apartment at 32-04 82ndSt, one block down from Northern Blvd. and the FireHouse.&nbsp; The Brown bus stopped right in front of our building. We had fire escapes in that building and I remember sitting on them in the summer when it was too hot in our top floor apt.&nbsp; There were two family houses across the street with concrete steps and porches. On our side, there were probably 5 more of the 6 family apartment houses before the one family private homes began and stretched all the way to Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Those were the days when we really knew our neighbors...it was hard to walk to the boulevard without stopping and chatting with at least six or eight of our neighbors.&nbsp; There were alleys along side of these buildings and small backyards where we kids played.&nbsp; I went to St.Joan of Arc school with so many of my neighborhood friends, even though we were, for the most part, in different grades.&nbsp; There was no school buses for us &amp; when my mother felt we were old enough to walk to school, we did just that.&nbsp; Once I got to&nbsp; the other side of the boulevard, I remember passing all of those &quot;prewar&quot; apartment buildings and meeting my classmates along the way.&nbsp; Oddly enough there are times that I cannot remember what day of the week it is, I can still remember the names and cute little faces of so many of my classmates in SJA.&nbsp; Sadly, I will never forget Sr.Mary Alice who taught me spelling in the 1st grade. I remember her as being a tiny nun who was very strict.&nbsp; I vividly remember her spelling bees &amp; the day she asked me to spell &quot;water&quot;. She scared me to death and even though I knew how, my nerves got the best of me and I stammered and just couldn&#039;t do it. I guess I wore her patience because she slapped me across the face &amp; called me stupid !!!!&nbsp; Looking back, I&#039;m sure she is the one person who later in life, gave me the strength to defy another order of nuns that my childen had in elementary school....so thank you Sr. Mary Alice for making me a strong, but fair and tolerant mother to my own children.&nbsp; I also remember the principal, Sr. Dunellen (?spelling) who my little 4&#039;11&quot; mother confronted with fierce anger, after she said I &quot;needed a haircut&quot;. I guess she had something against burnettes with long curly hair!&nbsp; You didn&#039;t want to mess with my litlle Irish american mother!!&nbsp; I remember the art teacher, another little lady with red hair and freckles.&nbsp; There may have been a music teach/nun who had a portable organ (with wheels) that she would roll into the classroom..I think her name was Sr. Gertrude.&nbsp; The one num who I will never forget as long as I live was Sr. St. Catherine, who in my childs eyes, looked like what the Blessed Mother would have looked like. Beautiful &amp; such a sweet temperament.&nbsp; I have so many wonderful memories of my 8 years at SJA, unfortunately not all of them were sweet and loving.&nbsp; Oh how I wish I could see some of the little girls I use to play with in the schoolyard at lunch time.&nbsp; Even the smell of the lunchroom would be welcome all these years later. <br />I remember Fr. Boylan and his beautiful snow white hair &amp; his associate, (little) Fr. Mooney.&nbsp; Hey Fr. Boylan, guess who has snow white hair now!<br />Thanx for letting me walk down memory lane!<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_53129">I graduated from SJA in 1950 and lived at 32-26 84th Street. When I was born (1936), we lived at 32-06 82nd Street for a short time. Dr. Lobell had his office on the SW corner of 82nd and 32nd Avenue. The principal at SJA was Sister Donalda. I attended SJA from 4th grade thru 8th. Sr. Mary Martin, Sr. Edith, Mrs. Monahan, Mrs. Quinlan, Sr. Patricia and Sr. Sylvia. I was never in Sr. St. Catherine&#039;s class but do recall and agree with what has been said about her; she was what I would imagine an angel would look like. The art teacher that was referred to was Miss Parker. There was another red-headed teacher in SJA by the name of Mrs. Powell. There was a Franciscan Monk who would visit SJA occasionally who would sing for us - as well as teach a music lesson - Father Rudolf. As I recall, Fr. Boylan was the Pastor and he was assisted by Fr. Lenihan (who became the Pastor of Our Lady of Fatima when that Parish was formed right after the war), Fr. Cunningham, Fr. Mooney and Fr. McCarthy. From 1964 until 1968 I was a driver on the Triboro Q-33 bus between B&#039;way and 74th and LaGuardia Airport. Renewed some old friendships during that time. <br />I&#039;m really enjoying the memories that are being shared on this forum.&nbsp; </div>

I lived at 37-52 89th street &amp; went to PS 89 &amp; JHS 145. Next to my building was an empty lot we played in, called the Defense Yard.<br />My great aunt had a book store around the corner on 37th Ave, between 89th &amp; 90tn street-Bookshop Ida Dormitzer. Does anyone remember this?<br />Carole<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I grew up just up the block from you and across 37th Ave. from 1943 until I left for college in 1960. I remember your great aunt very well. Not only did she tolerate me and a friend just passing time in her store while ostensibly looking for a book in the dog days of summer, but before I was old enough to know what was going on, she kept a 3-volume copy of either Sandburg&#039;s bio of Lincoln or Gibbon&#039;s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (I can&#039;t remember which) on layaway for my mom, a Christmas present for my dad. And she sold solid wood Stromberg model airplane kits, so I didn&#039;t always get out without a purchase.<br /><br />I remember your Defense Field, although we didn&#039;t call it that. I suspect you called it that because it was fenced, a rarity in our area. I remember a lot of cars parked in it--the building beside it on the end of the block was a garage for a while.<br /><br />Do you remember the electric substation for the elevated &quot;subway,&quot; between 89th and 90th on Roosevelt?</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_66141">The Electric Substation off Roosevelt Ave., was a very spooky place with an awful smell. John Guare the Playwrite who grew up in JH and graduated from SJA in 1952, wrote a short story about a couple of &quot;feather-merchants&quot; making a forbidden visit to the substation. I believe it was published, but, I couldn&#039;t locate it. There was an empty lot on 85 or 86 Steet, between 35th and 37th Ave., that we used to play baseball and football on and was inundated with holes dug by little kids or dogs and was a hazard to attempt running on. Nevertheless, it was all we had to play in after all the other lots disappeared with the Post WW-II late 40 early 50&#039;s apartment construction. There were two cops (ex PAL guys) who tried organizing a bit of a league, and worked very hard with the willing to teach the basics of the games. It must have been very frustrating dealing with us as we never had full uniforms or pads and noone had cleats only sneakers. Can&#039;t remember their names but we referred to them as &quot;officer&quot;. Finally, St. Mark&#039;s and Community Church had Cub Scout packs that organized sport training and games on Saturdays. The coach of Community Church was a great guy and an FBI special agent named Joe Brock who was killed in the line of duty in 1948. Brad Corbett was a captain of the St. Mark&#039;s Cub Scout football team and many years later owned the Texas Ranger baseball team. Larry Judd was a fantastic athlete of Community Church and ran circles around us. Our paths crossed in the US Army when he was assigned to my unit from the 82nd Airborne. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_69525">I do remember Sr. Donalda the principle of St. Joan of Arc for my 8 years there. She was a big woman with a pleasant but serious face (who wouldn&#039;t be serious looking with a school having average classes of 68 kids?) First grade had an ancient nun by the name of Sr. Fostina and she of the gentle kindness was perfect for tiny kids. In 3rd grade we had Sr. Benedict who while she was nicknamed the &quot;Gestapo&quot; was a great teacher and had the entire class paying attention every day to her lessons. Our class (mixed) had a dozen extremely intelligent girls who seemingly at the time used to get 100% in each subject, when Pastor Rev. Boylan read out our report cards in class. Only one boy had a major number of 100%&#039;s and I was usually chided at report card time for &quot; poor&quot; conduct.&nbsp; Lots of gabbing and note passing. Sports were very slim at SJA but Miss Wiseburger the gym teacher got us exercising in the Gymnasian once a week, and at lunchtime there was hand ball against the school wall. After school we used to frequent the empty lots for baseball, football, stick ball and hide and go seek. We had some super &quot;Tom-boy&quot; classmates who joined in with us playing sports and two of them were better at sports than any of us. Sr. St. Morris, our fifth grade teacher, strict, bright, fun, always challenging, demanded daily class participation from everyone so you had to have done your homework. Reading assignments were very demanding but in retrospect it helped me immensely in high school and college. She was singlehandedly responsible for helping me find my way in Math, and her extra help at that time gave us all a big advantage. Her expectations for us made us want to attain her approval. Overall, we were very lucky to have so many good dedicated teachers at SJA and am amazed that we ever learned anything with the class sizes of 65-75 kids. The school had a &quot;Junior School of the Theater&quot; associated with a top flight &quot;Theater Guild&quot; both putting on shows with amateur talent and Broadway/Off Broadway professionals living in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
