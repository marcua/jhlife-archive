					Sorry I keep asking silly questions but this is my first kitchen renovation and I&#039;m going nuts. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the question: I am looking into sinks and I&#039;d like a deeper than regular one (ideally 10&quot; but 9 would do as well). I have narrowed it down to Liena Bay, Empire or Blanco but the first two are more reasonably priced. Have you had any experience with either Liena Bay or Empire? Do they look good or s the stainless steel cheap-looking? <br /><br />Appreciate your advice!

					What I&#039;m concerned about is that when you leave graffiti without cleaning it up immediately (like the Feel Beauty Place), one starts getting the sense that people don&#039;t really care and anything is permissible. You get the feeling of being in a run-down place, a bad neighborhood. That&#039;s the reason why the few times our bldg was vandalized, we cleaned it within hours. <br /><br />I like Mr C&#039;s idea about involving local kids in the clean-up process. Is that viable? Any thoughts?

					Coming home tonight at 1 am, I saw a Crown Container Company garbage truck picking up El Chivito D&#039;oro&#039;s garbage SPILL A HUGE amount of disgusting, smelly garbage on 84th Street -- so much of it that it actually spilled over the parked car on the western side of the street. The street is covered with profuse amount of liquid and my car slid as we drove. <br /><br />I called 311 and filed a complaint againt the truck. I was then transferred to 911 to report the unsafe conditions on the road, where I was told that &quot;we arrest people in the streets, we don&#039;t clean them&quot; (that&#039;s a quote). The sanitation dept # I got is disconnected and I could not speak to them directly. <br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />Does anyone have a working dept of sanitation number? <br />Is that a problem everywhere in the neighborhood? <br /><br />I am asking because I&#039;ll be in touch with 37th Ave Store Owners&#039; Assn and with the community board because this is unacceptable. THanks for your replies in advance. <br /><br /><br /><em>(moderator note: thread merged with earlier thread on similar topic)</em>

					Hi, I live in a building right off of 37th Ave. Lately, the Chinese restaurant on the block has been putting off its garbage containers not on 37th Ave but on 85th Street, right next to my building. The containers leak chronically and the sanitation people are so careless they always -- EVERY night without exaggeration -- spill half of the garbage while they drag it to their truck. <br /><br />The smell has been horrid, and the spillage makes the sidewalk completely disgusting. I have called 311 numerous times and filed complaints about the restaurant and about the sanitation people. To no avail -- the only action they took was to issue a ticket to the corner store, because it&#039;s closest to the spillage, although the garbage is clearly not theirs. (The incompetence of the NYC bureaucracy continues to surprise me daily...) <br /><br />What other steps can I take? Should I write a letter to the restaurant? Who do I call? <br /><br />Any insight is appreciated, this situation is unbearable! <br /><br />Thanks!

					This is how living rooms were done at the time, localized lighting was the vogue. That&#039;s not only in JH but in many early 20th century buildings. <br /><br />If you&#039;re up for a larger project, you can get an electrician to wire for an overhead light. It will be a couple of hundred dollars or more, and then you&#039;re going to have to repaint, etc. Alternatively, you can get a plug-in overhead lamp but as Chuckster said, it is kinda ugly. A friend of mine installed wall lights (sconces and such) around the sitting areas because it gave her a more finished look. My issue with that is that you can&#039;t really change the space very much. <br /><br />I personally use my original living room as a study and have 4 table/floor lamps that give pretty good light.

					I haven&#039;t done it in such an organized manner but I know that C-Town is so much more expensive than Trade Fair, not to mention that there&#039;s always a discrepancy between the listed price, the label and the scanned price. Met is also generally more expensive than Trade Fair. <br /><br />With the smaller grocers around both prices and quality varies, so I just walk around until I find something I like.

					I think it&#039;s a beautiful building with nice apartments and a lovely garden (although not the only one to take a full block). <br /><br />When I started looking for an apartment in JH, I was about to buy something there. For various reasons, the contract didn&#039;t go through, it was more the sellers than the coop itself. However, while researching the building, I discovered that in the very recent past (i.e., in the 90s?), they had a rather serious financial problem and were close to bankrupt. Allegedly, some connection with Albany somehow saved the day (in terms of allowing them to get financing??, don&#039;t remember the details). This caused me a lot of anxiety and I had my lawyer investigate everything in detail, beyond the financials. He probably has records of it but is in Australia right now so he won&#039;t be of much help. <br /><br />I would, again, do some research on that. I also believe that things have been turning around for the neighborhood and for Dunnolly Gardens, and as long as they are stable financially right now, that should matter more than their past problems. But I&#039;d just want to know everything so I know what I&#039;m getting myself into. Good luck.

					I have just spoken to a couple of guys about some work to be done at home. Steve Suba (646-322-1956 or 718-446-7243) seems competent and prompt (in calling back and getting here in time, unlike Antonio). Contrary to information on the local forums, he himself is not licensed but his partner is. I.e., if the job needs to be filed with the DOB etc. it will be done through his partner but a fan installation job seems to me (a non-electrician) a relatively straightforward one, and his expertise seemed to me totally adequate for a much larger project. <br /><br />I am probably going to go with another electrician, whose bid seemed to be a little better for my project, his name is Ed Seelig, completely licensed and very competent and prompt. His cell number is 516-315-9275. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

					If I remember correctly, the building on the N side of 35th ave at 83rd St did some restoration to their terracotta decorative elements as a part of a larger project. I am not sure but it would not hurt for you to ask them.

					I think there are quite a few of us in their 20s or early 30s, and I think the population of hip non-hipsters is growing, either driven by or resulting in cooler places opening up on 37th Av. <br /><br />

					That&#039;s my hunch, too. Did a huge amount of research on DWs and the way they pump water and nothing suggests it is different than just sink draining. Thanks for your reply.
