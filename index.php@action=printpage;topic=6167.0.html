				Looking for someone to help build a wheel for a bicycle. I suppose I can take it to a bike repair shop, but I thought I&#039;d check here first. I have all of the parts but not the tools nor the know-how. Basically I had to replace the rear wheel rim of my folding bike and a friend started but didn&#039;t have the tool to remove the cassette so it is sitting in my apartment with spokes strewn about. Someone in the Bronx would charge me $25, but it&#039;s the Bronx... come on.

				I realized I wrote &quot;help rebuild&quot;... of course I don&#039;t know a thing about it, so it wouldn&#039;t be that I needed help. I am looking for someone who can do it. Thanks.

				Yeah, that will be useful info. There is a bike shop on 37th and 90th or 91st, CiCi&#039;s, but I wouldn&#039;t trust them with anything more than simple repairs. In the past I used to go to George&#039;s bikes (or maybe Bikes by George) on 12th street between 1st Av and Av A, and they have done some work on my bike that I was satisfied with. But it will be great if someone know a local person. <br />

				Have you checked the Bike COOP at Time&#039;s Up (Williamsburg)? http://times-up.org/index.php?page=bike-co-op (http://times-up.org/index.php?page=bike-co-op) I went there when I first started riding, to learn how to fix a flat. <br /><br />They&#039;re having a wheel rebuilding workshop this weekend: http://times-up.org/calendar/detail.php?calendarid=3184 (http://times-up.org/calendar/detail.php?calendarid=3184) that&#039;s free - they&#039;ll mention they take donations and point to an envelope, but it&#039;s no pressure. And they have additional hours that their repair shop is open - they won&#039;t fix your bike, but they&#039;ll teach you how to do yours.

				I have had great experiences with buying, and fixing bikes at the guy on 43rd and Junction blvd. He is right off of Junction. Its basically all used bikes and a little old man in the back room who seems to be an amazing bike mechanic!

				The bike shop on Roosevelt and I think, 61st, is terrific. Really nice people and great prices. Recently had three things<br />done to my bike including an item purchased and it was under $40. A flat can usually be fixed in 10 minutes. And<br />they always thank you for your business which I love hearing.
