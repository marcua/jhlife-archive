				There&#039;s a huge line of people at the school on 37th Ave, and canvassers handing out flyers for 3 blocks in either direction. It looks like a polling place for an election. And I asked someone who said in broken English that that&#039;s what it is. Not knowing much Spanish, I wasn&#039;t able to get much more info there. But I found out online that today is the Colombian congressional election. So presumably people are voting. <br /><br />Can anyone shed some more light on how all this works? It just seems odd to me that there&#039;s a polling place in one country for elections in another. Is this common? I&#039;m just curious what people know.

				hey there:<br /><br />yes, this happens with expatriates from just about every country (well, those that have free elections, that is). when i lived in astoria, i remember elections in malta and cyprus having pretty spirited elections. there have been other -- mostly central and south american -- elections that have gotten some interest around here over the last 15 or so years.<br /><br />i wonder if the same is true in reverse -- say, for folks from here who move to one tax haven or another.....

				the voting process in colombia disenfranchises many.&nbsp; It&#039;s by paper ballot and to vote, you must place an x on the party you are voting for, and then the individual candidate.&nbsp; if you just put an x on the candidate, your vote doesn&#039;t count.&nbsp; and if you just put an x on the party, you vote for all candidates on that party&#039;s line.&nbsp;

				Colombian Top Candidates Tied for May 30 Vote &nbsp;(http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/05/19/world/international-us-colombia-election-poll.html)<br /><br />excerpt:<br /><br />Mockus, whose Green Party has few seats in Congress, had surged from single digits in opinion polls in April to challenge Santos with a message of clean government. The son of Lithuanian immigrants, he appealed to voters weary of scandals in Uribe&#039;s second term. <br /><br />Polls now show the candidates neck and neck after Santos, scion of a wealthy Bogota family, revamped his campaign and Mockus suffered from slip-ups in debates with his often meandering, philosophical speaking style, analysts say. <br /><br />Once seen as a failing state, Colombia saw huge security improvements under Uribe, who sent troops to drive back Marxist guerrillas and cocaine-trafficking paramilitary gangs. Violence has dropped and foreign investment has surged. First elected in 2002 and re-elected four years later, Uribe was barred by a constitutional court from seeking a third term. <br /><br />
