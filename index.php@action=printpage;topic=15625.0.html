				Can anyone recommend a non-profit in the neighborhood that works with recent immigrants? I would like to volunteer and do my small part to show people that, no matter what the devastating results of this election may indicate, the real America values immigrants and the vitality that they add to our country. <br /><br />Thank you!

				&nbsp;On 75th street near Roosevelt, there is a penguin statue affectionately named Wink which is dressed seasonally -or for a sports<br />team- by Elcy, a woman working in an office a couple doors in from 37th Road. Ask around for her if you want to help very locally<br />with what she does for some of the immigrants on Roosevelt and in the area. She provides immediate needs which is sometimes<br />to use the bathroom or the computer as well as more complex problems with translation and followups on government applications<br />and policies. She is an unsung hero in Jackson Heights in that her organization is just her. But she is beloved and was a recipient<br />of a JHBG Good Neighbor Award last year. <br />
