				If recreational marijuana is legalized in NY, should bodega owners be allowed to sell it? If it is legalized, I&#039;m not sure how things would work in terms of who gets to sell it, but bodega owners claim it shouldn&#039;t only be big corporations making profits. Since bodegas already sell regulated items like beer, lottery tickets and cigarettes, can that serve as an assurance that bodega owners will follow&nbsp; new rules governing sales? There&#039;s a big push for allowing it made by advocacy group, United Bodegas of America.<br /><br /><strong>Gothamist</strong>:<br /><br />NYC Bodega Owners Urge Cuomo To Let Them Sell Marijuana When It&#039;s Legalized (http://gothamist.com/2019/02/18/bodega_owners_marijuana.php)

				smoke of any kind irritates me, too. but yes, of course they should be allowed to sell it.&nbsp; i&#039;m pretty sure the prohibitions against cigarette smoking would apply the same way. if only vaping was similarly banned (i don&#039;t think it is, or if so, it&#039;s not enforced)

				No, No and No.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who has been to a dispensary in any other state and country knows that the proprietors and sales people are there not only to sell you things, but to prevent you from buying something that you likely will not want.&nbsp; There are different types of pot, and different impacts that the pot will have.&nbsp; There&#039;s the typical &quot;stoner&quot; pot where you&#039;ll eat a bunch of Doritos and pass out while watching The Big Lebowski, and there&#039;s other part that will enhance your mood, and won&#039;t put to you sleep.&nbsp; Those come mixed, and with varying strength.&nbsp; You need someone to explain these differences and point you in the right direction.&nbsp; And then, of course, there&#039;s edibles.&nbsp; You can&#039;t have the bodega guy sell a pack of gummies to someone without explaining that you can&#039;t eat the entire bag;&nbsp; without letting you what you should expect to feel after eating, and without explaining the various dosages.<br /><br />Pot may be harmless, but it&#039;s not like cigarettes.&nbsp; A pack of Marlboro and a pack of Lucky will do roughly the same thing.&nbsp; Not so with a strong Indica or Sativa.&nbsp; The bodega guy is not qualified to sell these.&nbsp; They have to sold by licensed stores with employees that know their stuff.

				WLIRfan is actually right on the money. it&#039;s been ages and ages since i partook of weed, and i&#039;d forgotten some of the ins and outs -- particularly as edibles are concerned. there&#039;s a way to convey the strength of stuff that&#039;s going to be smoked -- like the proof on liquor bottles -- but edibles are indeed tricky.

				It looks like AOC would be siding with the bodegas. Couched as a racial issue, AOC stated in hearing last week that 73% of license holders are male and 81% are white (CO and WA) and in Massachusetts 3% are minority (2% are women). Citing &quot;underprivileged communities,&quot; this would be disproportionate vis a vis those who have been busted for pot.<br />&nbsp;

				It&#039;s only a short, slippery slope for local pharmacies to demand to be able to sell Marijuana as well.&nbsp; :-/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=18790.msg91991.html#msg91991">Quote from: JHResident on February 19, 2019, 11:27:05 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How about 7-11&#039;s?

				most of the time it says if it&#039;s sativa or indica and how much THC is in it. The edibles can get a little dangerous but nothing like hard liquor. <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">Same effects can be said of different types of alcohol - I&#039;m not even sure what the differences in effect are between beer and tequila but I imagine there are a few. </span><br /><br />I am for the bodegas mostly because it will support small businesses rather than huge corporations - I have been very skeptical about making it regulated for this reason... I actually like how it&#039;s legal to grow but not sell because it floods the black market and also I&#039;m concerned about weed grown in labs. <br /><br /><br /><br />
