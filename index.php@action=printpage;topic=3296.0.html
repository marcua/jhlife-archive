				Ravi,<br /><br />Thanks for asking!&nbsp; <br /><br />Each year, since 2006, the Community Journal hosts the Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival in September.&nbsp; We planned to screen films (as we have in years past) at the Eagle Theater on 37th Road between 73rd and 74th streets.&nbsp; There was tremendous delay because of the Bollywood strike and then in early August the theater decided not to renew their lease because they couldn&#039;t afford the rent any longer.&nbsp; We have been in conversations with the 82nd Street Triplex and recently worked out a deal with them.&nbsp; <strong>We will be having a great one-day event on Saturday, October 24, 2009 - from 6:30 onward ... mark your calendars!</strong>&nbsp; More details will be coming out soon!<br /><br />If you would like to volunteer and get involved e-mail me at bryan@pufolkeslaw.com.&nbsp; Thanks!<br /><br />Bryan

				Hi everyone,<br />I&#039;m a volunteer for this event. &nbsp;It&#039;s one-night only [Oct. 24, 2009] and is just $20 for a ticket, which includes a wine/appetizer event with food from several local restaurants, two short films and and feature length film and then even more local food!<br /><br />I advise anyone who wants to go to get tickets early (now!). &nbsp;This is an abridged version of the event some of you may be familiar with, because of issues with space. &nbsp;This year it&#039;s being held for one night in a theatre that only seats 200, which means there is very limited availability for tickets.<br /><br />The press release has already been sent out to the general public, and tickets are selling fast.<br /><br />Hope to see you there!<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>some highlights from the PRESS RELEASE</em><br /><strong>2009 Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival -- Back Against All Odds</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Faced with the possiblity of no venue thanks to a film industry strike in India, rising rent in NYC and the logistics of holding a 3-day event, the 2009 Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival was nearly cancelled. However, through sheer persistence from the festival committee, a compromise was found. On Oct. 24, 2009, an evening of international flavors and cinema will be held as an abridged version of the Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival.<br />&nbsp;<br />Two short films, Grace and Team Taliban, will precede the feature length film, Soy Andina. The former two are films that deal with unique immigrant experiences in the US. Our feature film tells the tale of two women &quot;raised in different worlds -- an immigrant folk dancer from the Andes, and a modern dancer from Queens, NY-- who return to Peru to reconnect with roots and an astonishing world of traditional dance and celebration.&quot; More information about these films can be found at &nbsp;JHFFF &nbsp;(http://www.jhfff.org) . The films will be shown at the Jackson Triplex Theatre on 82nd St. in JH.<br />&nbsp;<br />The food portion of the festival will come in the form of a wine and appetizer hour with refreshments provided by local restaurants, which feature some of the most prominent cultures in the neighborhood. &nbsp;All of the featured restaurants are long-time festival participants, such as Novo, Rajbhog and Lety&#039;s. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;press release in its entirety can be found at www.jhfff.org<br />&nbsp;

				The Community Journal regrets to inform you that the 2009 Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival, scheduled for Saturday, October 24, 2009 is regrettably cancelled. &nbsp;<br /><br />We were just informed that the Jackson Triplex Theater, the planned venue for this yearâ€™s festival has suddenly and unexpectedly closed for good. &nbsp;As there are no other venue options we unfortunately have no choice but to cancel the festival. <br /><br />All payments made through the Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival website (via pay pal) shall be automatically refunded. <br />The scheduled â€˜after-partyâ€™ at the restaurant Limoncello is not cancelled. &nbsp;Please join us on October 24, 2009 at 9:30 p.m. at Limoncello for food, fun and festivities! &nbsp;Limoncello is located at 40-39 82nd Street. &nbsp;There is no cost to join us at Limoncello, however, donations are welcome and appreciated. &nbsp;Please RSVP to communityjournal AT gmail.com or 718-393-7711. <br /><br />The Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival is a program of the non-profit organization the Community Journal and each year, scores of volunteers make the festival possible. &nbsp;The untimely and unexpected closing of the Jackson Triplex Theater comes at a great cost, financial and otherwise, to the organization, its volunteers and all the communities that we serve. <br />We thank you for your support and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us at 718-393-7711 or communityjournal AT gmail.com. <br /><br />Sincerely, <br />The Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival Committee
