			Haven&#039;t tried them for breakfast, but I&#039;m pretty sure that I&#039;ve seen huevos rancheros on Taqueria Coatzingo&#039;s menu.&nbsp; Coatzingo is on Roosevelt Ave., between 75th and 76th (I believe).

			Coatzingo does have Huevos Rancheros. It was ok, but not great.

			Coatzingo has a second location as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 82nd St. just steps away from the 7 train stop, on the Elmhurst side.&nbsp; The address is 40-18 82nd St. Elmhurst<br /><br />Chowhound recently had a long thread called Taqueria Coatzingo - Why it is my favorite Mexican

			Sorry to go off-topic.&nbsp; This thread reminds me that in Berkeley, CA there used to be a breakfast place called Buttercup that served a delicious dish called &quot;Huevos Kathmandu.&quot;&nbsp; It was huevos rancheros, but with curry instead of salsa.&nbsp; Absolutely delicious.&nbsp; It would be a perfect fit for Jackson Heights.
