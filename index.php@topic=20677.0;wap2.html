			Can anyone recommend a place to board a 65lb dog near JH?&nbsp; He is friendly but needs a lot of exercise.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Sarah

			I use All Dogs in the City. They&#039;re in Astoria, but they do pickup in Jackson Heights. My dog loves it! I know a few dog owners in the neighborhood who use them too.
