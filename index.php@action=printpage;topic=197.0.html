				What gives with the Baskin Robbins shop located on 37th Ave.?&nbsp; It&#039;s been closed for quite a while now, but there hasn&#039;t been any indication of any news shops opening yet.&nbsp; Anyone have info on the locale?&nbsp; Just curious, since this is yet another prime spot for any inquiring entrepreneur.

				I remember during the blackout (was that summer 2002? 2003?) all of the local businesses really showed their colors.&nbsp; Many were open in candle-light late into the evenings.&nbsp; Some restaurants put tables out on the streets.&nbsp; The corner store on 37th Ave and 79th street granted me credit because I ran out of cash and no ATM&#039;s were working.&nbsp; No one price gouged... not even the stores selling those candles in tall glass with pictures of saints on them... that people were standing in line to buy.<br /><br />And Baskin Robbins on 37th Ave?&nbsp; As soon as the electricity went out, and everyone poured into the street on that hot hot afternoon, a lot of people headed to Baskin Robbins.&nbsp; But they decided not to open their freezers with the electricity off.&nbsp; They did not close for hours.&nbsp; They did not send their staff home.&nbsp; But they refused to sell ice cream.<br /><br />Electricity did not come on for 24 hours if I remember correctly.&nbsp; Jackson Heights got power hours and hours and hours after most of the City.&nbsp; And by that time, ALL of the ice cream at Baskin Robbins had melted and had to be thrown away.<br /><br />I will always remember the businesses that, by 8 or 9 at night, were giving away the stuff in their freezers.<br /><br />Baskin Robbins?&nbsp; Good riddance.&nbsp; <br />

				Yes, they are two buildings. I was just trying to use the idea expressed about getting the landlord clean-up Baskin-Robbins as a basis to get NorthFork clean up (spruce up) their building. I guess I was more confusing that clear. <br /><br />We want Jackson Heights to look inviting.

				Here&#039;s a promising sign.&nbsp; There&#039;s a new glass facade on this space, and the &quot;windows&quot; appear to be hinged down to ground level, which suggests that they plan to open the restaurant completely to the street in nice weather.&nbsp; That would be wonderful!

				I asked the man inside what it was going to be on Friday. I got that it was definitely&nbsp; going to be a restaurant with a bar; and I thought I heard him say Indian to confirm <strong>Toddg&#039;s</strong> sources, but he *was* just the contractor, and didn&#039;t really know any details. Some woman on the street started getting kind of excited at me, telling me that I shouldn&#039;t assume that it was an Indian place just because the man was Indian, but I don&#039;t think I was- I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s what he said.

				The old Baskin Robbins on 37th and 76th st is being renovated. The construction permits in the window&nbsp; are for the construction of customer&#039;s bathrooms, and they put in tiled flooring. It sounds like it will some kind of restaurant. I&#039;m hoping its a french brasserie with sidewalk seating&nbsp; :), but realistically, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s a Mexican restaurant.&nbsp; :-\ We should know very soon because it looks like they are almost finished.
