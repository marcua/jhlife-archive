				The 19th Annual Jackson Heights Halloween Parade will be held on the afternoon of October 31st. &nbsp;This wonderful event is the second-largest Halloween Parade in NYC, and (I&#039;ve heard) the city&#039;s largest children&#039;s parade. &nbsp;All are welcome to participate.<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Beautification Group Halloween Parade Committee (http://www.jhbg.org/committees/halloweenParade/parade.html) needs volunteers to help stuff goodie bags for the kids, and to help distribute them for the parade. &nbsp;To find out how you can help, contact them at 718-565-5344 or info@jhbg. <br /><br />The parade starts at 5 pm at 89th Street and 37th Avenue. &nbsp;It proceeds down 37th Avenue to about 76th Street, where goodie bags are distributed.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a report on last year&#039;s parade (http://suddenworld.com/2007/10/28/the-little-halloween-that-could-the-18th-annual-children%E2%80%99s-halloween-parade-in-jackson-heights-ny/) from Sudden World. &nbsp;And here are some photos (http://flickr.com/search/?s=int&amp;q=%22jackson+heights%22+halloween&amp;m=tags) from past years.<br /><br />(http://farm1.static.flickr.com/119/286608028_c9b1640856_m.jpg)<br /><br />And if you absolutely insist on checking out that <em>other</em> Halloween parade (you know, the little one in Manhattan (http://www.halloween-nyc.com/index.php)), you may want to consider joining Project Bueller (http://projectbueller.tumblr.com/).<br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This parade is an annual tradition.&nbsp; Every year it gets better!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wasn&#039;t aware there was a website though ... years ago, in its infancy, my dad was involved in it with some guy named Ralph ... we would just show up the night before at 69 to pack bags (the real work!!), and get these cute JACKSON HEIGHTS PARADE MARSHALL badges (I have a collection through the years!) to pass out bags the next day.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A couple of years I bought the kids from my special ed classes to march together.&nbsp; Since my son was born, it now a tradition for us to march together (his attended his first one at age 6 weeks, dressed as a baby dalmation and I was in scrubs ... all the way to last year as Scooby with two girls from his pre-K.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think that Scooby in the pictures linked is him though ... :)

				This year&#039;s was pretty good!&nbsp; Seemed very organized!<br /><br /><br />We marched with the crew from PS 69 ... actually, right at the front, as one of Luc&#039;s friend&#039;s sisters was holding the banner.&nbsp; He got to hold hands with his two favorite girls too ... quite a good night!

				Yes, I think whenever Halloween falls on a weekend they&#039;ve done that.&nbsp; It beats the darkening skies over the parade and trick or treating on the weekdays, especially for taking photos!
