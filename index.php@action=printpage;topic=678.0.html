				Is there proper etiquette about how long you can sit in a coffee shop after you finish eating?&nbsp; I don&#039;t drink coffee so I don&#039;t frequent these establishments but today I wanted to check out either Expresso 77 or Starbucks since they both look very inviting.&nbsp; I just wanted something lite to eat and in both places people who were finished eating were either reading or on their laptops.&nbsp; Because of this there were no empty tables so I left each place and got a very nice sandwich at Ricky&#039;s cafe (my first time there).&nbsp;

				eddie, I completely sympathize with your dilemma, as this has happened to me on more than one occasion.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there is any written rule on how long one can occupy a table at a coffee shop, but I do believe that common sense would dictate in these circumstances.<br /><br />In my opinion, it&#039;s unfair to place a shop owner/manager in a position to ask a customer to leave.&nbsp; It really should be up to the individual occupying a table to have some consideration for both the shop owner, who needs to make money, and the waiting customer as well.&nbsp; I know that when I visit these establishments, I&#039;m very conscious of this, so if I see a customer waiting to be seated and I am finished eating/drinking, I gather my belongings and leave.

				Honestly, people who occupy tables long after they have finished their coffee AND see new patrons entering a full establishment should really get up and leave, or purchase something else to justify occupying the space for more time. It&#039;s unfair to the owner who needs customers to stay in business, unfair to other patrons, and horribly inconsiderate. So friggin annoy, I swear. <br /><br />If any of you remember Rudy Greco&#039;s coffee shop on 37th between 79th and 80th - he once shared with some folks I know that he made very little money because people would come into his shop and camp out. As full as a place may look, if people are not buying things, the place is at risk. Rents on 37th street and vicinity are high - we all know this. These wonderful shops and restaurants that we like to patronize are only in business if they sell things.

				I agree in small privately owned places (in terms of purchases being proportionate to sitting time), but for multinational corporations, I vote you take your time!!

				&nbsp;It is frustrating when people stay and prevent others from enjoying their coffee and pastry.&nbsp; It should not matter who owns the shop.&nbsp; Respect is respect.

				Well, my response addressed a proprietor&#039;s concerns more than the issues raised by the original post.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, do you rush to finish a meal at a restaurant when there&#039;s a line?&nbsp; Do you calculate the cost of your meal and determine how long you can sit?&nbsp; I am a huge advocate of being considerate to others, and I&#039;m not a sit-in-the-coffee shop type of girl, but I can only guess that the people who &#039;park&#039; there with their computers or a book are there because it&#039;s the most relaxing or comfortable escape for them.&nbsp; I truly don&#039;t get that, but to each his own.&nbsp; <br /><br />While I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very considerate to linger for no reason when you see people are waiting, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s any more fair to make someone feel like they have to rush out if they intended to do homework/read the paper/etc for the afternoon.

				Regardless of whether you&#039;re there to read or work on your laptop, I think it would be rude to expect someone to rush through their meal just because you&#039;re waiting to be seated.&nbsp; I know I would never rush my meal, but if I do see that there is someone waiting to be seated, and I am finished with my meal, I will gladly leave rather than linger.&nbsp; I would hope that the same courtesy be extended to me if the shoe was on the other foot.&nbsp; What I absolutely hate is when a restaurant owner/manager makes every attempt to rush a customer.&nbsp; And I&#039;m very sympathetic with the fact that money has to be made, but I consider it in poor taste when you receive the check before you even take the last bite or consider ordering a dessert for that matter.

				A person should be able to eat and drink what he or she purchased without being rushed but a purchase does not give a person the right to park in a chair for hours.&nbsp; Many establishments encourage people to enjoy themselves by providing WiFi capability, etc.&nbsp; Places make rules when there is a problem.&nbsp; For instance many McDonalds in the city have a loitering/time it takes to eat a meal.&nbsp; &nbsp;They did not start out with the rule; they needed it because people were finished with the meal and staying preventing others from enjoying a meal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#039;s face it, no establishment in NYC has enough space.

				It&#039;s also important to remember that coffee shops in general, and Starbucks in particular, strive to sell themselves as a &quot;third place (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Place#Starbucks)&quot;- not home, not work but that third place where you feel comfortable and want to spend a lot of your time (and eventually money). A &quot;home away from home&quot; if you would. The feeling that you couldn&#039;t spend as much time as you wanted there is counter intuitive to the concept (though perhaps not to common courtesy). Corporations (and I would assume to a lesser extent small business owners) that strive for this ideal want a customer to feel comfortable and welcome- hence the chairs the couches, the soft lighting- and like they&#039;re in their own home (or a good friend&#039;s home).

				I seem to remember back in the dark ages that the &quot;third place&quot; was the neighborhood bar. Or more the local pub. Ah, the good old days.

				Sorry guys, I&#039;m going back to coffee shops... I&#039;ll leave u 2 in your fantasy bar!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />This afternoon, I went into E77 and every table was full but mostly people sitting, one to a table, on their computer.&nbsp; For me it&#039;s not a big deal cuz I&#039;m usually walking my dog there so I can&#039;t sit inside anyway.&nbsp; (Thrilled about their new bench.)&nbsp; But I wonder for other people who might be on a break from work.&nbsp; There&#039;s really never a table available.&nbsp; I wonder if anyone&#039;s ever said something.&nbsp;

				I have NO qualms about asking if I can share a table. It&#039;s just not right to hog a table if there are spare chairs at it.<br /><div align="center"><em>MUST have caffeine!</em></div>

				Major pet peeve...when people occupy chairs to place their groceries, backpacks, etc.&nbsp; This happened to me at Cannelle recently.&nbsp; While waiting for a table to open, a small group decided to use the only extra available chairs to rest their stuff.&nbsp; Ughhh!!!!

				I wonder how the new e77 computer policy is working out?&nbsp; <br /><br />If the place is still packed with laptops...is it because (1) the barristas are not or are unwilling to enforce their new policy, OR (2) laptop users are indeed getting up every so ofter to purchase more drinks OR (3) both?&nbsp; If so, then how does this improve the situation?!?&nbsp; <br /><br />I can totally understand why the management/barristas don&#039;t want to get involved in throwing people out of the shop...I read the &quot;third place&quot; article too, and it does seem like e77 is set up to be that kind of place.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still kind of like the idea of only allowing 3 laptops in the shop at any given time.&nbsp; That way, laptop users will police themselves...incoming laptop customers will naturally &quot;push&quot; out the sitting laptop users...its a simple self-policing method that doesn&#039;t involve the shop proprietors being stern with any particular customer!&nbsp; Other customers without laptops and looking for a place to sit won&#039;t have to compete with laptop users either...well, because there can be only 3 laptops in the shop at any given time...simple as ONE, TWO, and THREE.&nbsp; Oh well, what do I know about running a coffee shop...clearly e77 did their research on the subject.

				I don&#039;t mind the laptop people, however, I usually won&#039;t go to my fave cafe because there are no seats available- because of all of the laptop people.

				Eater spots a trend (http://eater.com/archives/2008/06/eater_map_wifi.php): Wifi is on the decline in coffee shops and on the rise in bars.&nbsp; <br /><br />Those looking to grab a seat at E77 or Starbucks may cheer this trend.&nbsp; But has anybody considered the social implications?&nbsp; Switching from caffeine- to alcohol-fueled creativity (and from brightly lit to poorly lit work environments) should have interesting implications for the productivity and character of whatever these people are busy doing!
