					Is there one board here (apologies if there is and I missed it) that lists the upcoming schedule or parades and events.<br /><br />Like, I knew tomorrow is the annual Pride event (and it looks to be even bigger this year, at least from the festival end, if the NO PARKING signs are any indication), and its usually the start of June.&nbsp; But as I stumbled on the fair today on 37th Road and had some great Indian food, I realized that it would be great if there was a list of what each week is.&nbsp; (I know most Sundays, there are parades on 37trh or Northern, throughout the summer.)<br /><br />If there isn&#039;t a board, anyone know any upcoming ones?&nbsp; (Especially ones I can get arepas at a booth at .. yum!)

I don&#039;t think being in hard times means one should hock the legacy locket she got from Nana, right?<br /><br />The former though, I see your point about the beer (which you say was bought seperately, as per the existing legislation), but not the steaks.&nbsp; Maybe it was for a special ocassion, or maybe that meal was going to last them for more than serving. Heck, we live a neighborhood we some of us eat out a lot (as we have a lot of great choices).&nbsp; Maybe they cook at home every night as eating out is beyond their means, so why not entitle them to the treat.<br /><br />Who are we to judge how people should live by the fact they use food stamps, and may be poorer than us.&nbsp; It&#039;s as bad as judging by race, religion, or gender, because its done on face value observations.<br /><br />Truth be told, its probably embarassing for those on assistance to have to use the food stamps in public because of just this type of scrutiny.&nbsp; After all, the nosy person on line behind them is more apt to notice them paying with them than cash or plastic.<br /><br />That all said though, I agree that the beer being purchased right after is disturbing, only because as I don&#039;t drink, I don&#039;t see the necessity of it, but I also admit that&#039;s my own value judgment creeping in.

					Regarding the East 21 and Happy Kitchen debate?<br /><br />East 21 delivers faster, and their prices are cheaper ($1 Miso soup, in bigger servings!), but ...<br /><br />... there is better quality shrimp shumai and salmon pieces at Happy Kitchen.&nbsp; But they are more expensive, the sushi is generally smaller, and delivery takes for .... .... .... ever.<br /><br />Both deliver, thank the heavens.&nbsp; &nbsp;:smiley6600:&nbsp; Neither has a large eat-in area.<br /><br />So, here how I see it:<br /><br />Single person, ordering in:&nbsp; East 21.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />On a date, especiall early in the relationship, ordering in:&nbsp; Happy Kitchen.&nbsp; &nbsp;:smitten:<br />Married/partnered with your date, ordering in:&nbsp; East 21.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt="&#58;o" title="Shocked" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br />
