				<em>Cross-posted with permission from JH Families listserv...</em><br /><hr /><br />Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I just wanted to let everyone know that a new restaurant, El Coyote Grill has started what looks to be major renovations on their new spot in Jackson Heights. The location is Northern Boulevard between 80th and 81st.&nbsp; Here is a link to their website. The food looks pretty good and so do the margarita&#039;s:&nbsp; http://www.elcoyotellc.com/.&nbsp; They even have a childrenâ€™s menu.<br /><br />I have spoken extensively with Hal, the property manager, and he has assured me that he is committed to bring in tenants that support the neighborhood and reflect the neighborhoodâ€™s growing eclectic mix of people.&nbsp; There is another open spot next to the El Coyote restaurant that Hal said he is currently in negotiations with a deli/sandwich shop that has a location near Columbus Circle to take that spot. He has also said that he likes to hear from the community about their wants and needs as well as any leads on future entrepreneurial folks looking to start their own businesses. We almost got an upscale childrenâ€™s clothing and toy store from Park Slope to take an open spot.&nbsp; His, and many of our dreams, is to place a bookstore here too.&nbsp; With the advent of Gallery Y, Mystic Planet, and Pio Pio 2, Northern Boulevard, with its relatively lower rents when compared to 37th avenue, is poised to play a big part in Jackson Heightsâ€™ continued evolution.<br /><br />Feel free to reach out to Hal with recommendations and referrals for his properties (845)-304-7620.<br /><br />Braden
