			Are you planning a regular pet store, or is this a supply and delivery only?<br />Really the only place left is Petco and that&#039;s a schlep over there. Something on 37th would be nice.

			You may find rents more reasonable on 35 th ave. Perhaps near the vets office<br />I know the cat feeders relied on coral aquarium for supplies. They donâ€™t buy gourmet but they buy a lot and consistently
