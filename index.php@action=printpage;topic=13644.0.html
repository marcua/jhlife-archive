				The Barnes &amp; Noble on Austin Street in Forest Hills has not renewed its lease, so it will be closing soon.&nbsp; This news saddens me, but what I find surprising is that a new Target will be replacing it.&nbsp; Seriously, is there a need for another Target when there&#039;s one not too far off on Queens Blvd.?&nbsp; I guess Target is not really the issue here, but rather the demise of a bookstore.&nbsp; By the way, the article mentions that the one located in Bayside is also due to close.<br /><br />From the <strong>New York Daily News</strong>:<br /><br />Target will replace Barnes &amp; Noble in Forest Hills (http://www.nydailynews.com/target-replace-barnes-noble-forest-hills-article-1.2338093?utm_content=buffer282d7&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDNRealEstate+Twitter)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I loved going to barnes and noble and letting the kids get books. This location was also close by. While it saddens me that they are closing, I knew it would happen. Every time I went people were just reading books in the aisles and kids were running all over opening the toys and destroying the books. There was never a line at all. I guess I am going to start looking into a kindle even though I love a paper book.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				bellabella, the Astoria Bookshop mentioned is wonderful. When last there, a children&#039;s book author was about to visit and<br />the atmosphere was electric as the kids prepared. My whole family reads and the topics vary and we came away happy<br />with everyone finding choice books. Please support them as they are the treasured indie bookstore surviving as a rare <br />species just another town away.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s sad that they&#039;re closing.&nbsp; What I really thought was sad was when B &amp; N undercut every single independent book store in NYC, forcing them to close because they just couldn&#039;t afford to take the losses by selling books for the same price that B &amp; N was charging.&nbsp; B &amp; N could afford to charge less at the time because they bought in bulk, and because they did so to take customers away from these mom and pops.&nbsp; So, to see a big corporate giant finally get its due seems like sweet revenge to me.<br /><br />As for books, like many people, I still read -- but on my Kindle.&nbsp; I do pick up an actual book when I run into an independent store, like Strand.&nbsp; But I wouldn&#039;t buy it from B &amp; N.

				But you have no problem buying from Amazon? Did you read the huge article in the NY Times about how they treat their employees? Did you read about how they treat their warehouse employees in particular? And about how the way they run their business has undercut authors and publishers economically? Amazon seems to me hugely more objectionable than Barnes and Noble. You are harking back to an issue (B&amp;N vs the independent bookstores) that happened years ago--and ignoring what is happening today.

				I worked seasonally at a B&amp;N on Long Island through high school and college -- wonderful people but I sure am glad I didn&#039;t take up management&#039;s offers of a management-track position...this was 5 years ago and even then the writing was on the walls, what with half the store taken up by toys, board games, headphones and other electronics, and now vinyl records, and less and less books. Oh well. <br /><br />Alibris.com is good for used books, especially out-of-print ones. Better than Amazon, anyway, though of course they don&#039;t offer a drone delivery option.

				I worked full-time at a small independent bookstore chain in the mid-nineties.&nbsp; It was a great place to work.&nbsp; I loved books, and I didn&#039;t drink coffee.&nbsp; Then a B&amp;N moved in about 100 yds down the road.&nbsp; They sold cheap books, and coffee.&nbsp; My manager swore we would never sell coffee, but within 6 months we had a small self-serve coffee kiosk and a growing clearance section.&nbsp; Within another 6 months the entire bookstore chain went out of business.<br /><br />Since then I&#039;ve purchased many books at B&amp;N, simply because there was little real choice available.&nbsp; Over time I actually came to enjoy browsing there the same I would enjoy at other book shops.&nbsp; So when I hear about a bookstore closing I always feel a bit sad, even if it is a B&amp;N.&nbsp; The people who work there love books, and so do the people who shop there.&nbsp; And all those people are losing in this situation.<br /><br />But still there is a part of me that is sadistically happy to see this happen to B&amp;N... truly, what goes around comes around.&nbsp; It somehow feels like just a little bit of justice. ;D<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size">(oh yeah, I still don&#039;t drink coffee.)</span>

				I am hesitant to compare the demise of the B&amp;N franchise to the near-annihilation of the indie book store. When a small business closes, a huge investment in time and money and someone&#039;s dream, is gone. B&amp;N and other big chains are usually diversified and can readily shift focus. In &quot;going out of business,&quot; they enrich by selling inventory and facilities, laying off workers, and trading stock.

				An indie bookstore would probably be more likely to consider the location than a big chain store that is contracting. Though my understanding of Jackson Heights commercial rents is that they are pretty high, so I don&#039;t know how many entrepreneurs there are out there that want to open a bookstore in a high rent area. (someone told me it was almost as expensive here as Manhattan.) Someone did it in Astoria. Maybe someone else will try to do it here some time.

				A bookstore in JH is a complete pipe dream.&nbsp; It&#039;s not gonna happen, indie or mainstream. An indie store would likely look for an area with lower commercial rents and a higher percentage of native English speakers.

				I know the rents are high. But it&#039;s quite silly -- I&#039;m being kind -- to imply that only people who read English would use a bookstore. Have you ever been to Libreria Barco de Papel on 80th Street? Have you ever been to Buenos Aires? It is without a doubt one of the most vibrant bookstore cities in the world, better than New York, London, Paris.&nbsp; <br /><br />An indie molded like Astoria Bookshop or Greenlight that curated a selection of new and classic books in multiple languages could do quite well, I think. Titles from contemporary big (genre and literary) authors in Mexico and South America, India, China, mixed with all the English-language stuff you see everywhere else could attract book buyers from all over Queens, and could also serve as a hub for readings and book groups for authors and readers of all languages. There could even be a nice cafe, like at Housing Works. <br /><br />Tell you what: if I win Powerball tomorrow night, I&#039;ll give it a shot!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				&nbsp;Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but hasn&#039;t the building&#039;s street level already been divided into what looks like separate storefronts?&nbsp; I think it was mentioned before that habib bank is going to be occupying at least one of them.&nbsp; That would probably make it hard for a large-scale operation to come in. Unless it&#039;s&nbsp; set up like the old Staples in&nbsp; Forest Hills, which had a small street level presence but an elevator to take you upstairs to a much larger store. <br /><br />&nbsp;An independent bookstore would be great. And I already miss Barnes &amp; Noble&#039;s in Forest Hills. Does anyone know what the rents are that are being charged in the building? I think that can help give us an indication as to what would be feasible in the space. I&#039;m going to guess that the independent bookstores in Astoria pay less in monthly rent than our 37th Ave.

				Mainstream or indie bookstore in JH would be great! Though, I agree it&#039;s unlikely in Brunson building due to high rent. Spoke to a few of the staff of the convenience store that previously occupied the corner spot of the Brunson building (who also have a shop on 37th b/w 83 &amp; 84th). They mentioned trying to secure a spot in the Brunson building but can&#039;t afford it. According to them, Habib bank is moving into their old corner spot and is paying $18K per month. Not sure if this is true or not. If it is, unlikely that a small business will be able to afford these type of rents. As for books, I occasionally purchase Spanish language books at a couple of small bookstores/variety stores on the other side of Roosevelt.

				the GNC is paying between 9-10K per month....it&#039;s really not that much different in any mid-scale area of brooklyn or queens. we won&#039;t have any small businesses at all in two decades, but it won&#039;t really bother the &quot;new&quot; new york, since it&#039;s become a pit stop for those who want a place to amuse themselves for a couple of years between college and mamaroneck.

				Brutally funny Dssjh.&nbsp; &nbsp;My wife calls it &quot;the blueprint&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Start off in Long Island, spend 10 years or so in the city, get married, then return to Long Island to&nbsp; start a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;I have to admit though, walking on Broadway in Astoria on a Fri night, I feel like I&#039;m 10 years too old.

				It&#039;s a matter of perspective. I don&#039;t see it as a lost opportunity; rather, I see it as each neighborhood offering something different. The housing stock in JH is high in co-ops, along with some houses and condos, and not much development. Therefore, the population skews older and more settled in their lives. Astoria is going to skew younger, hipper and more transient.

				It&#039;s funny AmazingJason, when I first moved to Astoria in the mid 90s, it was quite different than it was today. Largely Greek (not mearly as much anymore), your main drinking options were a couple of Irish dive bars.&nbsp; Im sure many (possibly you?) on this forum remember this not so distant past.&nbsp; There was one &#039;cool&#039; bar, called Tupelo (not around anymore, though the owners now own Sparrow). The Bohemian beer garden was nowhere near as popular as it is today, largely populated by elderly, czech men.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder what they would think of the silent disco that goes on there now!<br /><br />There is a degree of change in the air in Jackson Heights, for better or for worse.&nbsp; My thoughts are, rather than it becoming a young, hip, neighborhood,&nbsp; I get the feeling it&#039;s going to head in the direction of Park slope stroller set rather than Williamsburgh hipster.&nbsp; The reason largely being some of the factors you mentioned above.&nbsp; I think 37th Ave can maintain some degree of uniqueness while maintaining an active nightlife.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be loud 20 somethings on a bar crawl, as many may be concerned about.

				I agree PtBASS75.<br /><br />Looking at how things progressed in Brooklyn over the past 10/15 years...<br /><br />Astoria will be a Queens version of Williamsburg.<br /><br />While Jackson Heights will move towards a Queens version of Park Slope...<br /><br />And that&#039;s the inevitable direction it appears to be heading in the next 10 years...<br /><br />I know a lot of folks lament this. But they also complained about it in Brooklyn when it was occurring. Until now, after a decade, and people can barely recall how Brooklyn was in the past.<br /><br />Such is the dynamism of New York City.<br /><br />After all, in the 1930&#039;s/1940&#039;s the history of Jackson Heights was that it was a restricted community...No African Americans or Catholics or Jews.&nbsp; And that&#039;s absolutely flabberghasting looking back.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				funnily enough, when i lived in astoria -- late 1980s, there were lots of dive bars and not much else.

				HousingWorks is a terrific operation (and a really nice store). <br /><br />they also get a LOT of their operating revenue from in-house benefit concerts -- and not by well-meaning locals. folks like Steve Earle, Conor Oberst, Indigo Girls (to name three that i&#039;ve covered there), who play 2000-3000 seat places at their regular gigs. probably a half dozen of those a year, which add a good 10 grand at a time to the coffers. if someone could arrange that, it would help pay the bills.

				There&#039;s also a used bookstore in Bayside, Turn the Page Again, that runs on the donation / nonprofit model. <br />https://www.yelp.com/biz/turn-the-page-again-bayside<br /><br />Its primary purpose (https://patch.com/new-york/bayside/meet-the-owner-larry-grubler-of-turn-the-page-again) is providing workplace training to people with serious mental illnesses who are re-entering the workforce. But it&#039;s also a cool little used bookshop where the books (all donated) are $5 or less.<br /><br />ljr raises a good point though... for something like this to work, it would have to be part of a much larger nonprofit (unless the space is an in-kind donation! which is hard to imagine). Turn the Page Again is run by Transitional Services, a nonprofit in Whitestone. <br /><br />All of that said I&#039;m happy we are finally getting a couple new bookstores in Queens! Independent bookstores seem to be having a mini-renaissance, and I could see another small for-profit bookstore surviving in Jackson Heights (though perhaps not on the main drag... maybe somewhere the rent was a little more reasonable). The Times had a great feature on that bookshop on 80th Street, which is helped by volunteers and has quite a following:<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/nyregion/spanish-language-bookstore-in-queens-librera-barco-de-papel.html?_r=0 <br /><br />Meanwhile, a woman in the Bronx is opening what will be the only bookstore in that borough, and she had what seems like a smart idea—making it bookstore by day, wine bar by night to diversify revenue streams and draw in more people: http://www.thelitbar.com/<br /><br />Seems bookstores that also do events, concerts, food, etc. may have a better chance of surviving than when the business is books alone. Lots of interesting business models to consider...

				Hey,<br /><br />I liked the housing works suggestion a lot. I donate to them annually and I am also into doing service work. I reached out to a friend who I thought had some kind of connection to them and he actually sits on the board of the bookstore! would not have thought to do that if it was not mentioned. I know they have a sorting facility in LIC. And the fact that Queens pride happens right here would also be a good fit. Perhaps they can be coaxed into doing an outpost. I will try to pitch this idea.<br /><br />I would like to do a bookshop here but, as someone mentioned it would not be easy to make it work as a source of income for my family. But, maybe some kind of space within a space or a thurs-sunday thing would be a good way to start off. I work seasonally so, it was always an idea for doing something in my off time. thanks for the input. I&#039;m gonna investigate further.<br /><br />

				Great!<br /><br />An outpost of Housingworks bookstore would be PERFECT here.<br /><br />And wouldn&#039;t need to be on the ground floor even.&nbsp; So maybe a large upstairs space somewhere might be available and more affordable.<br /><br />If we were really smart, we would&#039;ve pushed to have community space included here. <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=16405.0<br /><br />They do that in Manhattan/Brooklyn when negotiating with developers.
