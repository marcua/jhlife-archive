					... but the Green Market was still open.&nbsp; I took Luc to the park (what&#039;s left of it) to try out his new scooter, and was shocked ... the vendors were on the sidewalk, because the street (78th) never closed, as there were cars going through.&nbsp; Ironically, this was originally the last week of playstreet on the earliest calendars (and last year it ran even later) and was the raindate for last week&#039;s finale party day.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I naively believed that the street would still be closed as long as the market was open?&nbsp; Is towing also stopped now ...?

					... a time honored tradition, from the days in the late 70s when my friends and I would just go bell to bell in every building to the present day frenzy pre- and post-parade on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel Halloween strongly, it&#039;s one of my favorite holidays .. I host haunted Hosues in my school classroom every year, and my dad and I used to be some of volunteer Marshalls back in the Jackson Heights parade back in the 90s when it began.&nbsp; (For the past 7 years, I&#039;ve been a participant in the parade just as a parent, but I recall the days of packing those bags in PS 69 the night before when I was a volunteer marshall, so I always appreciate the work that goes into it.)<br /><br />So, my son and his friends hit the trick and treat route every year in the stores on 37th Avenue, as many are in the spirit.&nbsp; Some that you wouldn&#039;t expect don&#039;t participate, and some you wouldn&#039;t expect to participate do.<br /><br />This year, Lucas and company set out to trick or treat all the way to the starting point of the parade an hour before it began.&nbsp; We started between 78th and 79th Street, and worked our way up to 89th, stopping store by store.&nbsp; Many merchants were in the spirit:&nbsp; Flagship, many of the clothing stores, some restaurants, hair salons and even the liquor store on 84th!&nbsp; Some weren&#039;t (though I can kind of understand the candy stores having a hard time giving away what normall is their merchandise).<br /><br />I was thinking there should be like a standard &quot;TRICK OR TREAT&quot; done here type sign on the doors, so the kids know.&nbsp; It was disenheratening to watch Lucas and pals, who would hover at the door saying &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; afraid to venture in after a few rejections (doubly confusing if the door had decorations on it for Halloween, like Novo and Starbuck&#039;s, neither of which gave out treats) .. a standard neighborhood sign would maybe make that easier.&nbsp; You would think a store with the Parade poster in the window would be giving out treats, but even that&#039;s not a safe assumption.&nbsp; I actually liked (even though the timing was inconvenient) that some bigger stores had posted times (like 6pm to 8pm) when they&#039;d be giving out candy, as they were at least upfront about it.<br /><br />By 84th Street, our crew had two kids among it who after a few rejections had changed &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; do &quot;Do you have any candy?&quot;&nbsp; (Yes, Lucas was one of the blunt but jaded ones to coin that phrase ... though he remembered a &quot;thank you&quot; in EVERY store, so we&#039;re all good!)&nbsp; You can kind of understand though ... it&#039;s not always clear who has candy.<br /><br />Now, before I incite a riot, I&#039;m not saying every store has to stock up on candy ... it&#039;s everyone&#039;s right to participate or not.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying that a sign, maybe given out when the flyers are, to any merchant that wants them, saying something like &quot;TRICK OR TREATERS WELCOME HERE&quot; would allievate the confusion and traffic that stores may dread.&nbsp; Maybe a JHBG endorsed pumpkin logo?<br /><br />But I did LOL at the parents and kids who warned the next groups trying in stores that had none, saying &quot;no candy,&quot; etc etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about that candy kids!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					Last night, one of my former coworkers came up from Virginia and he and our school crew hung out in Jackson Heights most of the night.<br /><br />I even showed them the playstreet and how the signs says cars will be towed after 6 am on Sundays, as we have seen happen.<br /><br />Ironically, a block away, the cops were towing cars off 79th Street (where one of my friends had parked) for the Dominican Day parade.&nbsp; The paper signs had washed away mostly in the rain.&nbsp; Luckily we got there at 1:30 as it was happening, and the cars had only been moved (at least as of then) into the Mandees parking lot, and the cops were cool and my friend got his car out.<br /><br />But if you were parked (78th Street, between IS 145 and Garden School) there last night and don&#039;t find your car in the morning, check the Mandees lot.&nbsp; (Unless that was the temporary storage?)<br /><br /><br /><br />

					Despite being pretty tech minded (heck I create games and lessons for my kids online), I must admit blogging has until this point eluded me.<br /><br />Any bloggers out there that recommendations for a beginner?&nbsp; I have currently begun a biography of sorts for my son about his trials and tribulations in the school system, and I&#039;m thinking blogging is the way to hone the skills and chapters as I get ready to organize it.<br /><br />Also does anyone know what are the legality issues involved of putting things on a blog ... report cards, IEPs, artwork (in lieu of his photos, I am opting to have him draw his favorite &#039;scenes&#039;), police reports (don&#039;t ask!), etc.<br /><br />Advice can be here or if you prefer, send me a PM.&nbsp; (How techie did that sound?&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" />)

					Similar to the Lifers thread, I thought about this as I walked by PS 69 tonight ...<br /><br />I went to PS 69, as does my son.&nbsp; Any other 2 generation (or more??) families with our neighborhood schools out there?&nbsp; Did both you and your mother or son or daughter or father go to 69, or 145, or even 227 is around long enough now.&nbsp; Or even St Joan&#039;s or Garden (actually I went to Garden too.)<br /><br />(For that matter, I went to Bronx Science, as did my mother.&nbsp; But I&#039;m thinking locally here)

					the ever present scaffolding looks like its coming down.&nbsp; As I walked by tonight, there were crews at work dismantling it.<br /><br />Then again maybe I notice more because I&#039;m in my son&#039;s school a lot, but it almost looks naked with it.
