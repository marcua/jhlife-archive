				Last year, I walked in to Elmhurst Hospital because I was feeling a bit cold for a while and at that time, people were talking about Swine Flu and I just wanted to make sure I am ok.&nbsp; <br />I walked in there and waited for a few hours.&nbsp; And finally when I saw the doctor, he did some checking and he said &quot;you are fine&quot;.&nbsp; It took about 3 minutes for all the checking and there was no subscription for pill or anything.<br /><br />A few month later, I received the bill which was $777.70.&nbsp; At that time, I couldn&#039;t afford to have a good health insurance and it has a high deductible and it didn&#039;t cover any of $777.70.&nbsp; So, I am supposed to pay $777 for the 3 minutes checking.&nbsp; <br /><br />is this normal??&nbsp; I contacted the hospital and checked the amount and they said it is correct.<br />It is hard to believe that all the people I saw in the hospital waiting room are at least paying $777 if you don&#039;t have a health insurance since mine should be one of the simplest treatment I got from a doctor.<br /><br />I am not from this country and I know that health care in this country is so expensive compared to the rest of the world.&nbsp; But still to me, this is outrageously expensive.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do for this?&nbsp; I would appreciate your advice.<br />

				This hospital is horrible. Going in is like being in the twilight zone. Theyre are the absolute worse and I don&#039;t care what anyone says. Im lucky my baby is alive because they are so negligent!!! I had three nightmarish occurences here. NEVER will I go back. It is a true hellhole. Im surprised they didn&#039;t charge you for waiting in the filthy urine smelling waiting room.&nbsp; I would just call their billing department and explain you cannot and will not pay this amount you can&#039;t afford it. Tell them you want the bill lowered and will call the state to file a complaint for being charged an outrageous amount for Three minutes of service!

				You should not go to the hospital with a small complaint like that.&nbsp; If you suspect you have the flu, or if whatever seems to be wrong is not an emergency,&nbsp; go to any M.D. in the neighborhood - and there are several.&nbsp; It will take less time and be far less expensive.

				I also hate this hospital. It seems like most of the time the non-medical staff is chit-chatting away instead of helping people. The nurses are apathetic and the place needed renovations decades ago.<br /><br />A lot of people don&#039;t know this, but seven Duane Reade locations in Manhattan have walk-in clinics.<br />http://www.drwalkin.com (http://www.drwalkin.com)

				Thank you for some advices.<br /><br />I am glad to know it is not just me to think $777 for just 3 minutes of simple service is outrageous.<br />I will call Diane L. Wasenius tomorrow and will post it here about what happen again.<br /><br />

				Could we collectively assemble a list of doctor&#039;s offices/medical centers that are available locally at all<br />hours? I think it would be valuable as there are hidden possibilities here that might keep you from going<br />to the Emergency room if you can avoid it. I posted a request earlier this year and got some responses <br />but not an exact match for my situation which also needed medical attention of the semi-urgent kind. <br />I ,too, got a monstrous bill from Elmhurst which was negotiated but feel that the care was terrific and <br />have huge sympathy for their job- God knows I couldn&#039;t do it!

				You should never go to the hospital emergency room unless it is an actual emergency!&nbsp; It&#039;s the most expensive.&nbsp; The emergency room is designed to help people who need immediate treatment for things like a heart attack or a car accident.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry you were charged almost $800 for your visit, but I&#039;m not surprised.

				Marlene, I tried to call Diane L. Wasenius, but they said she no longer works there.<br />I guess I have to file a complain to the state.&nbsp; Could you kindly teach me what is the procedure?<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mean to go to emergency room.&nbsp; I just went to the hospital and ask where to go since I was feeling cold.<br />So, it is normal to charge over $700 for 3 minutes of service if it is in emergency room in this country??<br />That&#039;s crazy and this country doesn&#039;t have the universal health care yet.&nbsp; So, how can the poor get health care when needed???<br /><br />

				My bill for chest pains was $1500 hospital fees and $575 doctors fees. <br />Doc saw me for 30 seconds.<br />There is an office in building H I believe where I went and discussed my bill.<br />Depending on your situation (no insurance, unemployment, etc.) you may be entitled to a significant reduction. Go to the info desk and show them your bill and tell them you want to speak to billing department. They will direct you where to go. My $2075 got reduced to $60. It pays to&nbsp; fight it !!!<br />Just remember to have as much paperwork as you can when you go to see them (financial, employment, etc.)<br /><br />Good Luck !!! and Fight The Power !!!<br />

				My insurance covered my recent visit there as well, though also to note was the ambulance ride was NOT COVERED until I made a call to my carrier.&nbsp; They had me pay it ($900 for a 5 block ride), and reimbursed me about $730 of it in a check.&nbsp; So sometimes you may be to work with your carriers (where applicable for those that have) if the hospital is unhelpful.<br /><br />

				Re potential alterantives to Elmhurst emergency room:&nbsp; there is a medical clinic on the north side of Queens Blvd. about a block or two east of Broadway (right before Georgia Diner and Target) which is open for walk-in patients fairly late at night (around 11PM or so) and all day weekends. Have been there several times myself as have friends;&nbsp; have never waited more than 30 minutes or so and the care is OK (good enough for relatively straightforward things).&nbsp; <br /><br />They accept HIP and possibly other insurance.&nbsp; Even without insurance, I think the cost is relatively reasonable, at least compared to a hospital emergency room (an out of town friend went there a couple years back after a minor accident; cost for exam and tetanus shot was around $125 if I recall right).&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The NYC Department of Health website is not very helpful for searching for walk-in clinics. I did find this one, though:<br /><br />Corona Health Center<br />34-33 Junction Blvd.<br />Queens, New York 11372<br />Btwn: 34th Avenue &amp; 34th Road<br /><br />I can&#039;t find much information about it, though. They offer immunizations and std services. They don&#039;t even have a website in this day in age. Amazing. If people don&#039;t know about it, how are they supposed to get the funding they probably need?<br /><br />There&#039;s also:<br />Community Health Care Network<br />Queens Health Center<br />97-04 Sutphin Blvd<br />Jamaica, NY 11435<br />http://www.chnnyc.org/locations/queens/ (http://www.chnnyc.org/locations/queens/)<br /><br />More information can be found at the Office of Citywide Health Insurance Access:<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/hia/html/home/home.shtml (http://www.nyc.gov/html/hia/html/home/home.shtml)
