			I played stickball there regularly in the 1960s on weekends as there were some great strike zones etched on the walls. Also played basketball after class in the the yards, Mr. Hartstein taught me the hook shot which somehow I can still do from a long distance out. I&#039;d occasionally play pick up softball games. I think we fungoed the balls.

			I used to watch the older guys playing softball there. They belonged to a league.
