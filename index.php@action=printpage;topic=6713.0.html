				If you are wondering if I would use him again, the answer would be yes, but this time<br />I would check up on him every now and then to make sure everything that I wanted to be done was being done.<br />Not having put silicone on the other outside edge of the tub is mainly a cosmetic issue.

				I&#039;ve used Rob Mara (rmara@thegrountandtilegy.com) before several times and he does pretty good work.&nbsp; I had no shelves in my shower and he was able to cut, round, polish and install some marble into the corner of the stand-up shower.&nbsp; They came out very well and 2 years later, they have held up quite well.
