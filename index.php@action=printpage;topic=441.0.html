				I&#039;m a teacher at I.S. 145, and I&#039;m doing some &quot;greening&quot; activities with some of my seventh graders.&nbsp; I think a lot of my students would love to get involved with taking care of the park and neighborhood.&nbsp; Would your group be open to inviting some 12 year olds to participate in you meeting?<br /><br />Steven Carpenter<br /><br />7th Grade Science Teacher<br />I.S. 145Q

				At the Friends of Travers Park meeting last Tuesday (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=441.0), there was discussion of creating a working group to begin developing a &quot;green&quot; agenda for Jackson Heights.&nbsp; While this has not yet been well defined, it might include anything from creating more open space, to planting street trees, to finding ways to promote environmentally sustainability.&nbsp; As these efforts move forward, I&#039;ll post information here about how to get involved.<br /><br />But in the meantime, what are your ideas for greening Jackson Heights?&nbsp; &nbsp;If we begin compiling and sifting through ideas here, perhaps we can collectively make a useful contribution to Friends of Travers Park&#039;s efforts.<br /><br />We&#039;ve already had some discussion of this topic in Envisioning a More Perfect Jackson Heights (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=81.0).&nbsp; But this new thread creates an opportunity to have a more focused discussion.<br /><br />And don&#039;t forget, on March 8th is the first &quot;Going Green in Queens (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=491.0)&quot; event.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Energy independence and global climate change are two interlinked issues that may seem distant, but have important implications at the community level.&nbsp; Building energy efficiency, improving neighborhood transit services, and securing more neighborhood green space are all local dimensions of this global problem.<br /><br />The Sierra Club has just released a report, &quot;Sustainable Energy Independence for New York City (http://www.beyondoilnyc.org/),&quot; that outlines what the city should be doing.&nbsp; But there&#039;s a lot that can be done locally as well.<br /><br />There&#039;s a seminar coming up on March 4th on how co-ops can improve their energy efficiency (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=467.0) (and fight bedbugs).&nbsp; Earlier this year, the NY Times reported on efforts to improve energy efficiency at the Towers Co-op (http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/realestate/15cov.html).&nbsp; &nbsp;What else can be done?

				The Daily News<br />Peralta has green initiatives<br />BY DONALD BERTRAND<br />Tuesday, April 29th 2008, 4:00 AM<br /><br />Assemblyman Jose Peralta wants to see more green in his neighborhood.<br /><br />With that in mind, Peralta (D-Jackson Heights) launched what he is calling &quot;the 39th Assembly District green initiatives program&quot; last week.<br /><br />Taking heed of the saying, &quot;If we fail to prepare, we prepare to fail,&quot; Peralta pushed green initiatives at a community prayer garden at United Methodist Church at 37th Ave. and 82nd St.<br /><br />The church garden, said Peralta, is an example of what can be done. It will cost about $350,000 when completed and is worth every penny, said the Rev. Ronald Tompkins.<br /><br />A co-op on 73rd St. is exploring the possibility of a rooftop garden, Peralta said.<br /><br />The lawmaker added that he hopes to get more apartment buildings in Jackson Heights interested in the idea, which can dramatically cut down on air conditioning needs as well as reduce what is known as the &quot;urban heat-island effect.&quot;<br /><br />Peralta said he is &quot;trying to make sure that the state government puts money aside for rooftop gardens.&quot;<br /><br />Jackson Heights ranks 50th out of 51 communities citywide in the amount of park space, said Dorothy Phelan, a member of Friends of Travers Park.<br /><br />&quot;There is a real agenda now to try - even though available space is very limited - to do more,&quot; Phelan said.<br /><br />The group has joined with other local organizations, such as Jackson Heights Green, Queens Community House and the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, to get grants to organize the community around green-space issues.<br /><br />&quot;We are trying to get more and more people involved,&quot; said Phelan, noting that her group conducts annual plantings along 37th Ave. The group also plans to plant along the medians on 34th Ave.<br /><br />&quot;Everybody in this community is concerned about green space and the increase in global temperature,&quot; said Daniel Dromm, a member of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.<br /><br />Many of the private co-op gardens in Jackson Heights have fallen into disrepair over the years, Dromm said.<br /><br />&quot;One of the things that should be offered is some type of tax incentive to co-op boards or others who take the initiative to redo their interior gardens,&quot; Dromm said.<br /><br />&quot;The amount of money that is involved in redoing these interior gardens is extraordinarily large,&quot; he said.<br /><br />The Berkeley on 78th St., where he lives, is studying plans to redo its garden and is &quot;talking about $1.5 million to do just some of the basic stuff,&quot; Dromm noted.

				<em>Reposted with permission from the author...</em><br /><hr /><br /><strong>JHBG committee wins state grant to create a Green Agenda for Jackson Heights</strong>.<br />&nbsp;<br />Friends of Travers Park and its partner the Queens Community House were awarded a $25,000 grant from New York state in November t to create a Green Agenda for Jackson Heights .<br />&nbsp;<br />You may have already heard a little about the Green Agenda; We started work on the grant proposal for this project in early 2008. The Green Agenda will be a plan to make Jackson Heights a more environmentally sustainable neighborhood. It may include things like more park space, green roofs, more and better bike lanes, and community gardens. Thatâ€™s where you come in..<br />&nbsp;<br />The grant will enable us to hold a series of â€œvisioningâ€ meetings with Jackson Heights residents that will help us and planners from the Pratt Community Development Center develop the Green Agenda. We plan to involve all parts of the Jackson Heights community - all ages, income levels, native-born and immigrant - breaking down barriers that often divide neighbors. Ultimately we hope to produce a booklet detailing the green measures supported by the Jackson Heights community and then use this document to make these goals real.<br />&nbsp;<br />We are psyched about this project. Our grant proposal received a score of 95 from the state Department of Environmental Conservation, the second highest of the 50 grants awarded.<br />&nbsp;<br />The timing could not be better. If the large voter turnout on Election Day is an indication, people are energized and excited about creating a better nation. Our responsibilities, however, didnâ€™t end on Election Day. Grassroots efforts like the Green Agenda for Jackson Height s are the way people help make a better world in their neighborhood by participating in a process that we hope can become a model for other neighborhoods in New York City to do the same.<br />&nbsp;<br />So what other environmentally friendly features do you want for Jackson Heights: improved mass transit; bicycle racks at transit centers; programs on how to reduce energy consumption and costs for co-ops and rental apartment buildings; all of the above? So please join your neighbors in creating a better future for Jackson Heights and out city. Yes, you canâ€¦. Yes, we can!.<br />&nbsp;<br />For more information contact Len at lmaniace (at) aol.com
