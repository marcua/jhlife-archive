					Actually few of these schools are being reorganized into smaller schools. Most of the schools will have the same student populations and be renamed. They are replacing 50% of the teachers and appointing new principals. The other 50% will have to find new jobs or go into the &quot;ATR&quot; pool. Teachers will not be reinterviewed until July, leaving many of them to find new jobs now so they feel secure for September. The logic seems poor to me, as I would think most of the highly effective teachers will be picked up by other schools by the time July rolls around. It&#039;s also extremely unfair to those who have been in the system for 20+ years and have only a few years to go until retirement. I know several excellent educators at some of these schools who fit exactly that description, and they are very worried that their last two years will be spent floating around an ATR pool because some schools are more likely to higher more less experienced teachers than experienced teachers to save money, especially now that budgets are tighter than ever before.<br /><br />Ultimately, it appears as if this plan targets teachers rather than improving the schools. These schools were ineffective due largely in part to poor policy and not due to lazy teachers. I know this because I taught at one. Now that I teach somewhere else, it is clear to me that the teachers I worked with who will be fighting for their jobs are just as good, if not better, than those I work with now at a &quot;better&quot; school. &nbsp;If I had an 8th grader set to attend one of these schools next year, I would be very worried about just how much improvement could be made to a school within only six weeks time. Throwing a bunch of new teachers together during a vacation no less is not likely to build community. And I would also be very concerned as to how many of the good teachers would wait around to see if they are lucky enough to be hired back for jobs they already have. <br /><br />

					Found a dog on 84th street and 35th ave.&nbsp; Small male, seems like a poodle with black and gray coloring. Has rabies tags from Sunnyside pet healthcare center.&nbsp; I&#039;ve left a message with the vet office and posted on craigslist.&nbsp; If anyone sees any signs or knows of a missing dog, please let me know.&nbsp; Thanks.

					I have had Verizon for a long time.&nbsp; We had terrible service in our apartment (84th and 35th) for the first two years, but recently service has really improved.&nbsp; My phone was terrible and would die because it would constantly be searching for a signal.&nbsp; A few months before I replaced it I noticed that it had more bars more often.&nbsp; Now with my new phone I have no problems.&nbsp;

					Sometimes I find the produce at the greenmarket is cheaper than the supermarket.&nbsp; Like last weekend, for example, I found that green peppers at the greenmarket were about $.50 cheaper than at Waldbaums.&nbsp; Herbs are always more for your money, and it&#039;s not like you have to spend an arm and a leg at the greenmarket either.&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear many children asking for squash blossoms.&nbsp; And if I were using foodstamps, you bet I would buy organic or local foods instead of the stuff from the supermarket.&nbsp; Why should my family have to eat food exposed to a variety of pesticides and growth hormones when I can purchase an alternative?&nbsp; I&#039;m glad that the greenmarket accepts foodstamps.&nbsp; Everyone should be able to buy healthy, fresh, local food for their families.

					My husband and I really liked the Saybrook and went to contract on an apartment there... until the seller backed out at the last minute without reason.&nbsp; The apartments are spacious, and the building well-kept.&nbsp; We really liked the super and the garden.&nbsp; I love my apartment now, but I still walk by there and wonder what if...

					Thank you Todd, for finding the statistics on this. I think the assumption is that because many of the buildings in Jackson Heights are more owner occupied than renter occupied our incomes on average are higher.&nbsp; However, I just had friends try to find a decent apartment to rent in Astoria, and crappy one bedrooms were going for 1800 at minimum.&nbsp; They found a beautiful two bedroom here for the same price.&nbsp; My husband and I couldn&#039;t even find a reasonable apartment to buy in Astoria under 300 thousand.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t see how NYCMac gets the impression that Astoria&#039;s average incomes are lower than ours.&nbsp; It seems to be that the way the real estate market and rental market are going there, only people with higher incomes will be able to live in Astoria.

You and I both know that these Jackson Heights folks have a much higher per capita income than Astorians. Just compare the difference in the numbers of coops and condos between our 2 communities. The last stats I read showed that the largest number of Astoria rentals were to the roommate generation. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Really?&nbsp; Do you have stats to back this up?&nbsp; I always thought younger people moved to Astoria because it was so close to the city- you know, an easy commute to their finance and banking jobs in Manhattan.&nbsp;

					If the majority of Jackson Heights residents don&#039;t have a problem with the way our traffic laws are enforced, then I don&#039;t see what the problem is. &nbsp;In fact, I feel better that our traffic laws are enforced as much as the article insinuates. &nbsp;People who violate parking rules deserve to be ticketed! &nbsp;If I get a ticket I don&#039;t whine and complain, I pay it! &nbsp;Unless, of course, I was wrongly ticketed. &nbsp;Unless you walk or drive down our streets every day having to swerve in and out of double parked trucks and cars, avoid cars making an illegal u-turns, wait ten minutes for traffic to move one block because of double parked vehicles, or even listen to the honking horns coming from behind said double parked vehicles from your apartment, then I don&#039;t think you can offer an informed opinion on this issue. &nbsp;Like other posters have said, traffic rules are here to keep us safe, and while some officers might be a bit overzealous, almost all the tickets written are legitimate. &nbsp;If you don&#039;t want a ticket, park appropriately. &nbsp;And if you have a problem with delivery trucks getting tickets, write to the mayor about how it affects the merchants in YOUR neighborhood.
