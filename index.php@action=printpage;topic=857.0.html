				That looks like Ted Nugent&#039;s cat, or it could be James Bond&#039;s......Pussy Galore, or perhaps Brian Setzer, maybe Eartha Kitt&#039;s......

				oh no, i don&#039;t deserve the credit.&nbsp; my neighbor took the poor cat in overnight and posted flyers around the block.&nbsp; luckily the cat&#039;s owner saw the flyers.&nbsp; a good ending nonetheless.

				I hope the owners put a tag on their cat.&nbsp; If it got lost once, it could happen again.&nbsp; <br /><br />A few months ago I was away for 3 days, I had someone dog sitting for me. My dog ran away from them.&nbsp; If it wasn&#039;t for the tag, I doubt I would have gotten him back.&nbsp; He was found 5 blocks away and had walked into a moving car.&nbsp; A couple who saw this happen, caught him and took him to the Vet Hospital on Queens Blvd. and paid a $100 to get him checked out.&nbsp; All this is going on while I was in Vegas and could do nothing but cry.&nbsp; Four hours after he was missing they called my cell so I was able to relay to the sitter in NY.&nbsp; I think if it wasn&#039;t for my tag and after they spent that much money on him, they would have kept him.<br /><br />Tags are so important.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t use that sitter any more!)
