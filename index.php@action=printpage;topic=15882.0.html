				Hi all, <br /><br />Can you recommend a good local vet? I was happy to see that Noah&#039;s Ark is close to me, but they charge $95 for an exam, which seems REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE (our fancy vet in Park Slope was only $65). I&#039; prefer someone within walking distance, but I&#039;d rather travel to a good vet than have a mediocre local one. <br /><br />Thanks!

				My two cents.<br /><br />Went to Noah’s Ark for a few years with a few cats we’ve had over the years. Tried to tell myself it was great despite being in a really tiny location, idiot receptionists, long wait times, super high prices, super expensive services “suggested”, Dr Tello’s&nbsp; dad seemed to have taken over Saturday appointments&nbsp; and is grossly incompetent. (2 years ago I brought my 15 year old cat in and he told me that she’s probably going to die soon and then tried to sell me on thousands of dollars of dental cleanings for her. Guess what, she’s still alive, asshole.) <br /><br />Final straw was their office not noticing an obvious heart murmur on a cat he’d been seeing regularly since he was a kitten. He had a heart disease that we could have been treating early on, but instead we lost him before he turned 3.(Thanks to Blue Pearl and their cardiologist we were able to manage it once found.)<br /><br />I now go to Heights Animal Clinic on 35th Ave. <br /><br />Never will I set door in Noah’s Ark or ever refer anyone there again.

				I helped an elderly neighbor bring her cat to Dr Tello a couple of years ago.&nbsp; I have no idea if he&#039;s a good vet or not, but I was really nonplussed at the hard sell they attempted.&nbsp; Everything was a package for multiples of hundreds of dollars down to charges for nail clipping and ear cleaning, and I&#039;m not talking about an extra ten bucks.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been a cat owner for just about all of my adult life and have never been charged extra over the cost of an examination for minor maintenance like swabbing out ears or trimming claws.&nbsp; Heck, I wasn&#039;t even charged for the cost of time when I was instructed in how to administer subq fluids and injections...

				Another vote for Dr. Rhiele at Heights Veterinary. You can just walk in--don&#039;t necessarily need an appointment--and the wait has never been unreasonable. They do not push costly testing or other services --it&#039;s up to you to choose what you want done. Recently they were wonderful with helping our 21-year-old cat who could no longer groom himself and developed a related infection. Their vet tech is great, too--warm and caring. <br /><br />And with our other cat, who has kidney disease and needs subcutaneous fluids, they said they could do that for us at no charge if we wanted them to--daily. We would only pay for the infusion materials. <br /><br />Unfortunately, our 21 year old cat went downhill fast and we made the difficult decision to euthanize. For that, we chose a home vet service that was recommended to us: Homefront Veterinary House Calls. I recommend them as well. They are based in Forest Hills, do house calls only, and the vet was very sensitive and helpful in taking us through the difficult process of saying goodbye to a cat who&#039;d been with us--and our adult daughter--for so many years. She helped all of us accept that this was the right thing to do for the cat at this point, and she sent a handwritten condolence note afterwards, which I thought was very sweet. And when I called to tell Dr. Rhiele that we had put our older cat to sleep, we got a card from them, too. <br /><br />It&#039;s also great that we can just walk there--it&#039;s 5 blocks from our apartment. You should also keep in mind that home call vets can&#039;t do everything office-based vets can do. Certain issues can&#039;t be handled in the home.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how prices compare between vets. It&#039;s all expensive--especially the tests--but I don&#039;t at all feel that Heights Veterinary is unreasonably priced.

				Thank you! I&#039;ll think a bit more about Heights Vet on 35th. We went there about 8 years ago and the vet we saw was really dismissive so we haven&#039;t been back.<br /><br />AVG was highly recommended to us by a friend and this board. It seems like in the past year or so their quality and customer service has gone downhill. We waited almost 2 weeks for them to approve a Chewy order for prescription food and meds. Another time it took them a week to approve. I&#039;ve spent literally hours on the phone with them and Chewy trying to get prescription orders approved. The front desk receptionists are rude and downright nasty. For instance, I needed to book an appointment to learn how to administer fluids to my cat and they scheduled me for a full vet appointment and charged me the full visit price even though I didn&#039;t even see the doctor. They said that&#039;s what I booked and that I booked the wrong appointment - even though they&#039;re the ones who booked me for a full visit when I said I just needed to see a tech for fluids. <br /><br />The vet we saw at AVG was rude, condescending, and implied that we were bad pet parents - said that we refused treatment and that he recommended hospitalization for my cat - he did not, because if that&#039;s what he needed, we would have done it. Then he said that we waited too long to get started with the fluids - but the wait was because they were not able to fit us in for an appointment. <br /><br />Dr. Tello was great until they raised their prices and started trying to upsell us on everything. We didn&#039;t even have appts with Dr. Tello, but with his father, a few times.

				Oh wow. I’m really sorry to hear that about AVG. <br /><br />Delaying prescriptions is particularly unacceptable. Heights Animal Hospital handles my Chewy order prescription stuff without me ever needing to follow up with a call- I just place the Chewy order and they communicate and my order ships. (One of my kitties eats prescription food, so I’ve done it many many times).<br /><br />I can’t find anything positive to say about either Tello after what they did. Worst waiting room situation ever, also.i still get angry and sad thinking about it / them and the morons on staff there. $$$$$$ is all they care about. <br /><br />(PS, one time I took my cat to Heights Animal Hospital because I thought there was a problem with her gums and they checked it out and didn’t charge me a cent. At Noah’s Ark I’m sure they would have billed a few hundred at least ::)

				A huge THANK YOU to everyone who recommended Heights Veterinary! Got in without an appointment and was seen within the hour. The vet was fantastic and took great care of my fur baby. When I followed up the next day for the test results the vet took time to explain everything to me, answered all of my questions and discussed next steps (and did NOT push expensive treatments). I&#039;m really impressed! Excellent job, and my cat&#039;s health is improving. Prices are reasonable (I think the exam fee was like $55?). I&#039;ll definitely go back there and bring my other cats there, too!

				Homefront Veterinary is also great--and Dr. Rhiele at Heights Veterinary continues to impress us. They also are wonderful about helping out without charging for everything. We have an older cat with several health issues and have had to take him in repeatedly just to check on this or that possible complication--and they do not charge us every time the vet sees him briefly. He is also patient about answering questions and taking phone calls.

				I have a very skittish cat, and my vet is Dr. Rhiele at Heights Veterinary (who is amazing!). If at all possible, I would recommend going on a weekday from 9-5-- it can be much more crowded in the waiting room on the weekends and a longer wait. Not sure what their situation is like these days though. For the check-up itself, Dr. Rhiele and the staff are typically very efficient and not too rough-- I wouldn&#039;t say my cat feels soothed and comfortable, but the visits are pretty quick and over with before she has time to really react.
