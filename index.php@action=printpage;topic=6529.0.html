				I just came home and Roosevelt/75th area was a madhouse like I haven&#039;t seen it before with stationary crowds (outside of the subway, inside was pretty vacant), cars everywhere and looked like a parking lot and patrol car lights looking like a disco... I got up to 37th ave and every block from 75-79 had two cops on it.&nbsp; Anyone know whats going on?<br /><br />

				I didn&#039;t see any cops, but when I came out of the Roosevelt Ave station at around 9:30 pm, I noticed that there seemed to be huge crowds of people out, both inside the station milling around and on the sidewalks in the blocks nearby.&nbsp; I felt something was going on but didn&#039;t see anything specific out of the ordinary and couldn&#039;t identify anything.&nbsp; I cut up to 37th Ave on 76th St and 37th was calm.<br /><br />There isn&#039;t anything listed on gothamist news map.

				My roommate and I noticed the police presence last night around 10:30 on the walk from the subway.&nbsp; We stopped an officer and were told that they were flooding the streets due to an increase in crime in the neighborhood.&nbsp; He was not specific.&nbsp; We probably came across 6 or 7 cops on the five block walk.&nbsp; I have noticed cop cars patrolling the neighborhood in recent weeks and new something had to be going on but last night was different.&nbsp; Cops were standing on corners and walking up and down streets.&nbsp;

				Since there has been a major media push about prostitution in the neighborhood, I would imagine that&#039;s why they&#039;re showing the flag...

				I think the increase of police presence may have to do with the &quot;groper&quot; still at large. There was even a recent piece on NY1 &nbsp;with Danny Dromm canvassing the area with the police. I&#039;m happy to see the police.....well, sort of, although I don&#039;t think it will do much good to stop the kinds of crimes that go on behind closed doors (ie. sex trafficking, drugs, prostitution, car vandalism). Certainly car breakins are a problem for the people who live here, but that occurs in the wee small hours of the morning when there is one cop car for the entire sector. Under cover cops in strategic locations where the frequency of crime is high would work better and be more effective without the visible &quot;police state&quot; vibe. In addition a multi agency task force needs to go in and address the serious problems. When you see so many police all at once it&#039;s like overkill and makes me feel like I&#039;m in a real unsafe place. A bandaide approach to a cancerous problem. I have never felt unsafe living here.

				AUG 20th Saturday night, we were coming home around 11:30 and there seemed to be a cop on every corner.&nbsp; Part of me is happy to see the increased police presence -but there&#039;s a feeling of uneasiness that comes along with it.&nbsp; I guess it comes down to more cops = less crime and everyone wants that.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know the explanation for the police presence throughout the neighborhood that evening.&nbsp; But what Shelby2 witnessed was unrelated.&nbsp; The 7 line was completely shut down for a couple of hours Friday evening due to a weather-related power failure, and there were crowds of people outside the station trying to catch taxis or buses home.&nbsp; It was quite a mess.<br /><br />http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/subway-problems-due-to-weather-20110819-akd<br />

				Might this also explain why there&#039;s been a mobile police command unit parked on Roosevelt Avenue in front of Friend&#039;s Tavern for the past month or more? -- I&#039;ve been kind of suspicious about their choice for a parking location, given the NYPD&#039;s continuing pattern of subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) harassment of the GLBT community.
