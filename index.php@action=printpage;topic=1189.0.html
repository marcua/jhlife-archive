				I hear some people talk about this in passing and I was wondering when this happend, &amp; what were the stores that burned down, resulting in the current office complex/parking lot/Rite Aid.<br /><br />Were all the stores on that side of the street one story high as the other is?

				I believe the block that you are referring to was all one story,&nbsp; all pre war architecture.&nbsp; There were several mom and pops stores.&nbsp; The&nbsp; only one that I now remember was a really nice stationary store. Before the area was landmarked there were two fires.&nbsp; One which partially burnt down the block---as a warning--- and an other one soon&nbsp; followed that burnt down everything in its&#039; entirety.&nbsp; Although I can not personally attest to this, rumor had it that they were purposefully destroyed to make way for the monstrosity that currently exist. I remember speaking to the owner of the stationary store at the time and this is what he had told me.&nbsp; The block was low density and very quaint.

				Three of the stores that burned were all favorites of mine:<br /><br />The Continental Restaurant was exactly that a nice Continental Restaurant with a nice bar.<br />Mike&#039;s Deli was a deli where you could order a sandwich or hot food and sit in a booth and eat in.<br />Glendale Bake Shop - was on the 82nd Street side and in addition to being a nice bakery had a nice deli section.<br />

				Florsheim&#039;s was the store on the corner of 82nd and 37th. I remember waking early that day (summer time?) and smelling fire. It was only later, when I came home from work that I saw what happened. It took years before the litigation regarding the height of the &#039;new&#039; building was settled, and although arson was suspected, nothing was ever proved.<br /><br />This was a real low point as that block was the cross roads of the &#039;old&#039; JH.<br /><br /><br />

				I remember the some of the shops, not the fire itself and then that area being a gigantic fenced off pit for the longest.<br /><br />I remember a Hallmark and a bakery. I also remember when they were constructing the building my friends and I would get inside and throw snowballs off the roof onto the people below.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />The &#039;new&#039; building is completely out of scale and really fucked up the quaint look of Jackson Heights.

				I recall that between the two fires (the first having only taken out two thirds of the stores), the Hallmark store that did survive had its in door a sign (handmade, all signs were ... this was 1980s) saying something to the effect of &quot;WE WILL NOT MOVE.&quot; and asking for witnesses to the (first)fire.
