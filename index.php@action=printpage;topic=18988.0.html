				we&#039;re still a while out on needing to do this, but i&#039;m curious as to how folks have handled this project in a lived-in home.&nbsp; <br />where did you put your stuff, and for how long?

				You should ask the contractor..&nbsp; in our case we did the work prior to moving in, but they will know.&nbsp; There is no real easy way to do this, unless your building/super can ‘store’ almost everything for a few days..&nbsp;

				In our last home the contractor had to do one room at a time because we were already living-in. There were two rooms that needed it: bedroom and living room. The guys who did it actually moved all the furniture from one room to the other and back again, doing the whole job over the course of a long weekend. When they were finished, they put all the furniture back where it belonged.<br /><br />Richard at USA Floors: 646-739-7535<br /><br />I hired them again for our home in Jackson Heights, which had horrible pet damage when we bought it. They did a good job. Here are some before/afters:<br /><br />https://renov8or.blogspot.com/2014/01/repairing-pet-damage-to-hardwood-floors.html<br />

				Minimal4me--your post just took me down the rabbit hole, as I followed your link and read your blog and all associated articles about your move to JH and your renovations. We got here in 2011 in a downsizing move from way uptown Manhattan and also marveled at the relative affordability of the amazingly beautiful apartments here. And just now are we starting to renovate our 1921 apartment, which was mostly in original condition when we bought it. Deciding exactly what to do is extremely nerve-wracking--so afraid of making a mistake and not liking the very expensive results in the end! And balancing aesthetics with practicality is challenging. A pedestal sink looks pretty, but where do you store stuff you want in the bathroom? We are going with a more modern sink/vanity with drawers. Thanks for your post!

It&#039;s a hobby; happy to hear someone is following - besides my mom. :) I kept a diary through our entire kitchen renovation, and I&#039;m glad that I did because even now just a few months later I&#039;m forgetting things that happened, even the &quot;electrical panel nightmare&quot;!<br /><br />Regarding the bath and the pedestal sink, if I had it to do again, I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d choose a console sink, even though it was right for the period of the home. I did choose one with a broader than average surface but it&#039;s still a pain to assemble hair products and tools or DH&#039;s shaving gear. I think I&#039;d look for something on legs but also with a drawer or drawers if I had a re-do.

				Minimal, please post your blog address. I&#039;m interested in visiting as well. I actually saw it once awhile back, but I never got a shout from you for doing so. <br /><br />...just kidding about the shout out!!<br /><br />I would have loved to have an open bathroom sink, exposed pipe, legs and shelves where removable baskets would make for quick and EZ access to toiletries, but it was the most expensive of the styles that would fit in my little space.<br /><br />As for kitchen sinks, I love Ed&#039;s farm sink, but that too is an expensive option. <br /><br />Sorry for this posting on a floor refinishing thread, but there is no one place for all these ideas.

				Does anyone have other floor refinisher recos? <br /><br />Agree with the group: move all items from one room to the next. The guys you hire will likely do it, but I would 100% be onsite when they move items back into the room to avoid scratches. Also a good opportunity to chuck needless items. And to get away for the weekend. <br /><br />If you have area rugs, ensure you get carpet protector as the new finish, even when dry, might be newly adhesive.

				I recommend New York Floor Interiors. They did great work and quickly supplied the workers comp and liability insurance forms my co-op required. My co-op was particular about the type of paint used and they complied. I recommend staying at an airbnb or booking a cheap hotel through HotelTonight during the work.<br /><br />CONTACT: Jorge Flores nyfloorintcorp (at) gmail (dot) com<br /><br />Good luck!
