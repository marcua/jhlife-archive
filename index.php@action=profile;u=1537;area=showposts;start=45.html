					My apartment faces 37th Avenue, and as I write this, Monserrate is riding by in a parade-float type thing, waving at people. There are 4 other people standing in the float and waving signs around him. 2 white vans with his name on their sides and with loudspeakers on top of them are following the float, blaring, &quot;Vote for Monserrate; yes we can,&quot; in Spanish. I wish that I could go vote for Peralta again.

I&#039;d say a broken bottle is a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; and that by slashing her across the face Monserrate had &quot;intent to cause serious physical injury.&quot;<br /><br />The only reason that this guy was not charged with (and convicted of) a felony is because he was a state senator. If a poor person living in the projects or a random person of color had been charged for the same crime, you had better believe that they&#039;d have gotten slapped with one of the felony charges. People don&#039;t usually get to slash each other across the face such that 40 stitches are needed and walk.

					I just watched the NY1 debate from their web site. I don&#039;t know if anyone else feels this way, but Peralta did not strike me as being entirely honest. He equivocated something awful when confronted with his incendiary campaign literature, and it seemed as though every answer he gave defaulted to his list of endorsements. As this was my first time seeing him or hearing him speak, I was a little disappointed with his disingenuous-ness. He seems to be just another slimy politician out for personal or political gain. Bummer.<br /><br />This being said, Monserrate (admittedly, expectedly,) really disgusted me. I couldn&#039;t believe the way he accused Peralta of victimizing his ex-girlfriend with his campaign literature, as though he had any kind of leg to stand on in invoking her rights. He came off as arrogant and conceited. He cast his assault conviction as a &quot;personal issue&quot; in his life, as though it isn&#039;t the business of the public to care that their elected representative is a batterer. The idea that women, especially, should just look the other way and simply consider the bills the guy&#039;s proposed, without any thought to the fact that Monserrate is a violent offender, is simply outrageous. There is no way I would ever vote for this guy.<br /><br />I guess that I, too, will be voting for the best of the worst. It&#039;s unfortunate.<br /><br />

					Hello!<br /><br />We have a little muttly dog, and we walk her up and down the streets, but she could really use a nice grassy field to run around on, and she could also use some other dogs to talk to. Where does everyone take their dogs for exercise and friendly doggie-socialization? In looking at Google maps, it seems as though the closest dog run is way to the south of here, and it appears to be a concrete slab next to the LIE. I remember hearing, when we first moved to the neighborhood about 8 months ago, that there was talk about creating a dog park somewhere close; what ever happened with that? <br /><br />Also, just a general (gentle) nudge to fellow dog-owners: please pick up your dog&#039;s poop! It&#039;s gross to leave it on the ground for other people to step in and it gives us all a bad name. I&#039;ve seen so many people idly watch their dog defecating, and then they just walk away, afterward. Ew!<br /><br />Thanks!

					Hello, neighbors!<br /><br />My fiance and I recently moved to the neighborhood (we love it). We were wondering whether there are any raw foodists or home-fermenters or homebrewers or kombucha growers in the area. If so, we&#039;d love to compare notes with you and maybe share some cultures!<br /><br />We are wannabe raw foodists, eating organic and raw when we are able. We&#039;re not crazies, however, and we do eat the occasional slice of pizza or tasty foods at local restaurants. We&nbsp; are not vegetarians, though we don&#039;t eat meat in quantity and always choose humane, healthy and (preferably) local sources. We are familiar with the Weston A. Price dietary guidelines, but we don&#039;t go overboard with that sort of thing, either (we drink caffeine and alcohol in moderation). We do own a copy of Nourishing Traditions!<br /><br />We are also avid fermenters and have made our own kraut and various brews in the past. We plan to make spicy kim chi in a Harsch crock in the very near future. We use a lot of recipes found in Sandor Katz&#039;s book Wild Fermentation. In the past, we grew kombucha for several years, and we want to get our operation started up again. If anyone has a spare culture sitting around, such a thing would be greatly appreciated! We also culture our own dairy and grow our own sprouts, when possible.<br /><br />The two of us want to get a beer homebrew operation up and running soon. We&#039;re both novices to this world, though, and so if there&#039;s anyone out there with experience who could offer some tricks of the trade, such information would be invaluable. We&#039;ve read a lot on the subject, but reading and doing are sometimes different things.<br /><br />I looked in the &quot;groups&quot; list and I didn&#039;t see any sort of organization in this neighborhood with these sorts of interests. Is there one out there? I wasn&#039;t sure whether to post this thread here or in the &quot;food&quot; section, so I apologize if I&#039;ve transgressed the forum boundaries.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />
