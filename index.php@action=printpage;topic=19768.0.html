				They&#039;ve eliminated their &quot;club card&quot; discount for the time being, so everything is full price (all sale signs have been pulled down as a result). not a huge deal, but i really hope they continue offer the senior discount for older folks, who really need the help at this time.

				Ehhhh...this is problematic and frankly a gross practice for them to engage in considering how much extra business they&#039;ve had. I often stock up when things are on sale ($5/5 pasta!) because the regular prices are kind of ridiculous compared to Target or Costco.

				I&#039;m a senior and I went shopping this morning at 7:20.&nbsp; No one outside on line.&nbsp; The few customer inside were mostly seniors.&nbsp; I was on line just 5 minutes.&nbsp;

				I arrived this morning at 7:05 thinking that I would immediately enter the store with few shoppers like I did two previous mornings.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; The line was past the entrance to the JCC half way up 77th St.&nbsp; I would estimate 35 on line.&nbsp; With masks on there&#039;s no way telling if they were all seniors.&nbsp; I went to Food Dynasty and they were closed.&nbsp;

				the line at Foodtown was all the way to Roosevelt when i shopped yesterday, thinking Tuesday was the best shot, but forgetting it was the first of the month. that line moved pretty efficiently, but they really &quot;relaxed&quot; the rule about how many people can be in at a time.<br /><br />when i finished my shopping, the single line feeding the three cashiers started at the head of aisle seven (the one with coffee, juices and baby stuff), wrapped around the back of the store and halfway up aisle ten (the frozen foods). since there were a couple of must-buys, i hung in there. for the record, Foodtown&#039;s employees were doing pretty great jobs across the board.<br /><br />Food Dynasty doesn&#039;t open until 8 a.m. these days.

(for getting on the outdoor line). everyone was courteous, both customers and employees, but it was still jarring. and it was odd to see that many people shopping at once. maybe it was just to alleviate the outside line, but still made it hard to abide by the distancing rules.
