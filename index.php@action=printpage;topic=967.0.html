				<span class="bbc_u">Just a tid bit of info</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">NYS states that the <em>seller is the client </em> and the <em>buyer is the customer</em>.&nbsp; This can change of course if you hire an agent to find you a property in which case your rep. is &quot;buyers agent&quot; and you will likely pay them.&nbsp; An agent has a fiduciary duty to his client, 95% or more of the time this is the seller.&nbsp; Dual agency will develop if you have a broker search for a property that meet your needs but you don&#039;t pay them and he/she will receive a split from the listing agent or from you and the seller.&nbsp; This is totally legal as long as it is disclosed.&nbsp; The danger exist that if the listing agents are not co-brokering or are paying an extremely low split (unfortunately very common in Queens) you will not find out about many wonderful properties since it won&#039;t be worth it for your agent to provide this info unless of course you agree to pay your broker an additional percentage of the sale upon closing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most brokers have never done this and it is totally foreign to them but in &quot;my experience&quot;&nbsp; the buyer will always get the best price when they hire and pay a broker to find them the best property for the best price.&nbsp; A broker will negotiate the best price possible whenever they allow the broker to do their &quot;thing&quot;.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget that full disclosure must be made and if you really want the best out there don&#039;t be penny wise and dollar foolish.&nbsp; Listen to your Broker and you may find that you will save thousands of dollars.&nbsp; You may not think about this but RE is just like other businesses, many of the brokers know each other and they all want to do the one thing they love the most, TO CLOSE!&nbsp; Sometimes buyers get lucky and find a fresh listing with the right price but often this doesn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; Last but not least...Don&#039;t Settle for less than you really want unless you are getting a super deal.</span><br /><br />NO I DONT DO BUYERS AGENCY IN QUEENS.&nbsp; SORRY.

				You are right 80st<br /><br />Anyone that has the luxury of time to market and sell their property should.&nbsp; But for those that have really busy lives and that luxury of time is one they don&#039;t have should of course hand it over to a broker.&nbsp; Obviously a time frame is worked out and a seller should do their homework and negotiate with someone that will look out for their interest.&nbsp; Another reason to work with a broker is the exclusive agency.&nbsp; For those that do not know what it means is that in an exclusive agency the seller can continue to market their property and at the same time sign up with a broker.&nbsp; If the seller finds a buyer then the seller owns nothing to the broker.&nbsp; If the broker sells it or anyone other than the owner of the property sells it the listing agent will still get paid upon closing.&nbsp; He may or may not have been co-brokering but that&#039;s another drama all together.<br /><br />If anyone feels compelled to market and sell their property in JH they should be able to do so fairly easily if they are below market value.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you properly qualify your buyer or are an active shareholder you will also avoid Coop Board issues. But if you are looking for market value than you must be able to be patient and make sure you get your comps from mgmt.&nbsp; As per the market today, I don&#039;t know why reports are so vague about the prices of coops vs houses.&nbsp; Coops are still selling well and the prices are not flat but merely stopped climbing out of control.&nbsp; Yes, some new developments that were priced aggressively are now having to reasses their price structure.&nbsp; <br /><br />For those that cannot continue paying the construction loans have in fact started selling to other developers at huge discounts and for those that used their own money to develop can afford to rent out many of them until such time is financially feasible once again to sell.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also to concider is that many, not all, but indeed many realtors actually have buyers waiting for specific properties in a specific neighborhood or building.&nbsp; Yes, there are many buyers out there still looking for their dream properties and a great part of them will hook up with a realtor.&nbsp; Guess what, most realtor will try to seel the units with the best commissions first,&nbsp; oooh, not pretty to say that, but as real as it gets.&nbsp; I don&#039;t list resales and I rarely market units that require Board approval but once in a while I see things :&#039;( that breaks my heart.&nbsp; But&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />

To be honest, it&#039;s just easier to make a blanket statement about any market than it would be to breakdown the market into new construction, condo, coop and 1 family, 2 family and so on.&nbsp; It would be interesting to hear from other realtors about how their coops are selling (or not).&nbsp; Have they experience an increase or decrease in the prices for the similar units?</strong>

				Hello all,<br />I come from a real estate family and I wanted to give you, particularly sellers, my angle on Jackson Heights&#039; realtors.&nbsp; The local agencies - like MPC Properties (Carfagna), Beaudoin Realty, JH Landmark, JH Properties, 718 Realty - don&#039;t work w/ other real estate agents and keep the full commission amount that sellers pay them.&nbsp; Larger real estate agencies - Prudential Douglas Elliman, Brown Harris Stevens, and Corcoran - always share the commission with cooperating agents.&nbsp; When the broker that you hire works cooperatively with other agents (in other words, he/she shares the commission), all agents citywide with a Jackson Heights customer will bring their buyers to the property.&nbsp; Go with the bigger agencies, folks - they offer an incentive to the city&#039;s real estate community to visit your property.&nbsp; The more people that see your place, the more likely you are to sell... the more likely you are to see a bidding war... the more likely you are to sell for the highest price!&nbsp; The smaller agencies limit exposure to your property by only showing your place to customers without brokers - in this case, you&#039;d never know the highest attainable price because you&#039;ve excluded every broker with a potential customer from the deal.&nbsp; Remember, competition is a good thing - play it smart, and good luck.

I just wanted to know if any of the board members spoke a language that I speak, because I was nervous about going before the board and I always like to dazzle people with my language skills.&nbsp; And... ummmmm... I lived in JH already.&nbsp; I expected a diverse board.&nbsp; To me, our diversity is our strength, not something to blush and stammer about.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could go on and on.&nbsp; But if I decide to move again, I&#039;ll go with one of the locals.&nbsp;

				KC,<br />It&#039;s unfortunate that you&#039;ve had bad experiences on the buying side of the equation, but let&#039;s face it, there are plenty of inexperienced real estate agents, and let&#039;s be real - they&#039;re not exclusive to big firms.&nbsp; The point I made earlier still stands.&nbsp; It is in the best interest of sellers to get the maximum exposure for their properties.&nbsp; Obviously, sellers also need to carefully discern between worthwhile and incompetent agents.&nbsp; I have nothing against the local real estate firms, however, their attempts to bar the competition yield fewer selling opportunities and ultimately lower prices - essentially, this is a disservice to the client.

I have also served in the Board of Coops as treasurer and Vice President for about 7 years.&nbsp; Years later I hold consulting positions and participate in committees in buildings were I own units and even in one where I am not a shareholder.<br />&nbsp;<br />With all due respect, a realtor does not have to be a &quot;Biggie&quot; to be a member of MLS.&nbsp; It&#039;s relatively inexpensive to become a member since minimal requirements are needed to join.&nbsp; I see nothing wrong with the MLS service since I am a member and I have benefited from it&#039;s membership.&nbsp; What I am against is the falsehood and attempt to mystify membership to the MLS.&nbsp; A member of MLS realtor is not more professional or better qualified than others since professionalism and efficiency has nothing to do with membership.&nbsp; While I admit that many of the programs and services including specialized training for members are beneficial these training services are not a requirement for membership and are not free to members thus the vast majority of members will pass on the fancier training.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The training is usually designed for special certification purposes and to &quot;close the deal&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are not necessarily structured to serve the general interest of buyers or sellers.&nbsp; I have met&nbsp; plenty of unqualified, uneducated and incapable realtors as members of the MLS but this doesn&#039;t mean I am going to generalized and attempt to point the finger at those brokers that depend strictly on MLS for their business.&nbsp; When you place a property in the MLS system it&#039;s thrown into a pool of thousands of similar properties.&nbsp; The property is seen by other agents that will be able to offer it to their customer hence the &quot;best possible&quot; scenario for the seller.&nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">In &quot;THEORY&quot; on paper it works,</span> but so does communism.&nbsp; MLS is a tool and an option for realtors to help produce buyers for their listings.&nbsp; On a sellers agency side the agent is able to show the prospective buyer any available property that has been listed.&nbsp; Unfortunately many of the better properties don&#039;t hit the MLS.&nbsp; The reason for that are many.&nbsp; For one, many realtors use the system to show how much better their &quot;in-house&quot; listings are.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />A large number of realtors are uncaring to other agents time and waste it by bringing unqualified &quot;lookers&quot; or people posing as buyers.&nbsp; It&#039;s so rampant that many listings agents will simply refuse to show the properties unless their client can show proof of funds or produce a current pre-approval.&nbsp; On a number of occasions I found myself helping sellers and buyers with their coop needs by using the MLS systems.&nbsp; I was able to help and co-broke these coop units but the listing brokers were so surprised they still call me today to help them with other properties.&nbsp; MLS is specially great for other types of properties like houses, newly develop properties and of course the more difficult properties to sell.&nbsp; To successfully market and sell Coops you need a neighborhood broker. Local brokers will have a better chance to know the building, they may know the Coop members, shareholders, the super or at least are close enough to the action that they know the intricate sociopolitical foundation of the particular coop board they may be working with.&nbsp; That is something a Broker outside of the neighborhood circle cannot accomplish for you wether it&#039;s a 200 agent office or a one person team.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />So, I beg to differ when it comes to the local coop market and add that you are dead wrong, not about the MLS but about the so called &quot;BIGGIE&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;What you may not realize is that many local brokers, and you did take the liberty to name quite a few, do co-broke but on a local level, a sort of their own close knit mini MLS.&nbsp; I sold a few properties that were with some very well known realtors in Flushing and Bayside for 6 Months with no takers.&nbsp; The sellers had dealt with me on other matters and gave me a few properties to sell in JH, Corona and in Forest Hills.&nbsp; Two weeks later I had offers for all units in JH, and in Corona.&nbsp; Forest Hills was a bit tougher since it had the most available units in the market but 5 weeks later and lots of leg work produced an accepted offer. This is not a fluke and it is because I am talking about Coops.&nbsp; Granted, they were sponsor owned but since then I had found myself with well qualified buyers being turned down by coop boards because I didn&#039;t know the Board or the Mgmt or the super.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t know because I am not known by the Building and so on.&nbsp; Ever since then I have decided to hand pick those listings that may require a coop approval.&nbsp; Trust me, it can get really ugly when a realtor doesn&#039;t have a good grip of what kind of&nbsp; coop they are dealing with.<br />&nbsp;<br />Choosing to be a member of MLS should be an automatic, deciding to keep the listing in-house is the brokers and sellers business.&nbsp; The broker may know he can sell it within 21 days.&nbsp; The likelihood of an &quot;outside&quot; broker knowing what the Coop Board is looking for is slim to none whereas the local broker will easily qualify a prospective buyer.&nbsp; Why in the world would any one co-broke a listing that is a sure quick sale.&nbsp; Now, if the property is on the market for 21 days with no serious buyer or the broker knows the property is not such an easy sale then absolutely, MLS from day one. If you choose to list your property with a broker you can request that they place it on MLS as a condition to the listing and most will.&nbsp; If someone is not ready to buy and is just looking I recommend hitting the open houses and browse sites like realtor.com.&nbsp; If you are looking to buy in a specific area or in a specific bloc or building avoid the MLS stigma and simply look into sites like Backpage and Craigslist or hit the streets and walk into several local RE offices and be honest.&nbsp; Tell them that you are in the market, that you are ready and that you will visit other brokers in the area in your search.&nbsp; On a final note, GET PRE-QUALIFIED before you start making appointments and be treated like royalty.<br /><br />I will continue the posting later since I feel obligated to expand on this extremely important issue.&nbsp; I will split the posting now and later will address the several reason why a broker may decide to keep a listing in-house or place it in the MLS.&nbsp; It may bore the heck out of most but it may bring a new perspective on the realities of the market.</strong>

				80thstreet and NYC Native -- thank you for your informative posts.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I follow it all, but they have been quite interesting and educational for this real estate newbie.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=58.msg6959.html#msg6959">Quote from: 80thstreet.observer on May 28, 2008, 11:19:39 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">More than a few MLS systems have been targets of federal antitrust law suits because of their anticompetitive nature that renders a great disservice to consumers.&nbsp; Agents willing to take smaller commissions have been barred from the MLS, along with agents willing to provide less than the full range of service typically provided by realtors.&nbsp; Internet-based real estate agencies have also been barred from joining the MLS.&nbsp; All this seems to be missing from your critique of the MLS.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This reminds me of this article in today&#039;s NY Times that may be of interest...<br /><br />The New York Times<br />Realtors Agree to Stop Blocking Web Listings (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/business/28realty.html)<br />By ERIC LICHTBLAU<br />Published: May 28, 2008<br /><br />WASHINGTON â€” The Justice Department and the National Association of Realtors reached a major antitrust settlement Tuesday that government officials said should spur competition among brokers and ultimately bring down hefty sales commissions.<br /><br />The deal frees Internet brokers and other real-estate agents offering heavily discounted commissions to operate on a level playing field with traditional brokers by using the multiple listing services that are the lifeblood of the industry, government officials said.<br /><br />The Justice Department sued the National Association of Realtors in federal court in 2005 on antitrust grounds, charging that its policies were stifling competition and hurting consumers. That case was scheduled to go to trial in Chicago in July.<br /><br />The settlement â€œis a win for consumers, certainly, who will now have the benefit of unrestricted competition,â€ Deborah A. Garza, deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in an interview. â€œThere inevitably will be more efficiency and more competition in the market.â€<br /><br />Real estate agents earned $93 billion in commissions in 2006, with a median commission of about $11,600, Justice Department officials said. Internet brokers, offering pared-down services, provided average rebates of 1 percent on commissions that normally ran 5 or 6 percent, translating into thousands of dollars per sale.<br /><br />Consumer advocates hailed the settlement as an important and somewhat surprising step by the Bush administration, which has staked out a position on many antitrust issues seen as favorable to business interests. <br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em>

More than a few MLS systems have been targets of federal antitrust law suits because of their anticompetitive nature that renders a great disservice to consumers.&nbsp; Agents willing to take smaller commissions have been barred from the MLS, along with agents willing to provide less than the full range of service typically provided by realtors.&nbsp; Internet-based real estate agencies have also been barred from joining the MLS.&nbsp; All this seems to be missing from your critique of the MLS.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition, I donâ€™t really see your point about jmp99 being â€œdead wrongâ€ about local realtorâ€™s unwillingness to work with other real estate agents and their desire to keep the full commission.&nbsp; You stated yourself that local realtors co-broker properties but only with other local brokers.&nbsp; This seems to the PERFECT example of the anti-competitive nature of local real estate agents that jmp99 is complaining about!&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, I wonder how many local real estate agents go to the trouble of explaining to their client (the seller) that the agent will go ahead and screen out any offers (regardless of the quality of the offer) or interests from potential buyers that are not represented by the few local agencies in JH.&nbsp; That hardly seems in line with a real estate agentâ€™s fiduciary duty to a client-seller, unless it is fully disclosed up front.&nbsp; HOW MANY SELLERS WOULD BE WILLING TO IGNORE AN OFFER SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WASNâ€™T BROUGHT TO THEM BY A LOCAL REALTOR?&nbsp; I CERTAINLY WOULDNâ€™T!<br /><br />I also disagree with your defense of local real estate agents over agents from larger city-wide agencies.&nbsp; There are certainly some agents from larger agencies that are simply clueless, but I just donâ€™t see the supposed advantage that local brokers can provide.&nbsp; You seem to suggest that local brokers have the inside scoop on buildings and will somehow make the sale go smoothly.&nbsp; Speaking as a co-op board member myself, I think that is a much too generous advantage you seem to award yourself.&nbsp; A prospective buyerâ€™s financials comes first and will always be paramount in my building.&nbsp; No real estate agent can miraculously help the process in my opinion when it comes to a prospective buyerâ€™s financialsâ€¦no matter what kind of inside scoop they think they might be in possession of.&nbsp; Also, being pre-qualified means nothing to a co-op board.&nbsp; It may indicate to an agent that a prospective buyer is serious, but a year ago, even a door-knob can get pre-qualifiedâ€¦that has no bearing on a buyerâ€™s ability to pay his/her mortgage!&nbsp; Therefore, the advantages that a local real estate agent may provide in terms of his ability to get the inside scoop is minimal at best!&nbsp; A hard-working agent from the larger agencies can get a hold of such information too!<br /><br />Your arguments seem largely based on what is good for you and other local brokers.&nbsp;

I read between the lines and if someone reads the posting and sees it differently than I did then you are right about jmp99&nbsp; not using the word MLS.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to see different angles of things and I saw it on the angle of an experience COOP agent and ex-board member of several buildings.&nbsp; JMP99 makes general mention of agents, using their names in a manner I feel was a bit unfair to them. JMP99 does make a statement about co-brokering that as I mentioned, in theory works best to secure the highest offer possible for the seller and ultimately benefits the Industry&nbsp; In the businesses that I am involved in it would be unforgivable to simply start naming other realtors or environmental/construction firms in an attempt to trash them.&nbsp; Many may not agree, but that&#039;s what opinions are about.<br /><br />I think 80thstreet got what 80thstreet got out of the posting and it&#039;s OK.&nbsp; I think that my rebut touched on too many issues and I did not address the issue specifically. I also failed to quote JMP99 so that the &quot;loss in translation&quot; was evident.&nbsp; There is such a thing as too long a posting and I certainly crossed that line a long time ago...LOL&nbsp; It would take a whole lot of witting to get my views understood and even then, unless you have been there it may still be foggy. Ever heard of &quot;reading between the lines?&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s exactly what I did and I felt it necessary to unmask the posting for what I believe it really was and I will not apologize for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lets&#039; start with the co-broker or cooperating broker and the antitrust mentioned.&nbsp; By JMP99 stating that the mentioned local agents do not co-broke JMP99 simply showed disregard and in my opinion total disrespect for these hard working local brokers.&nbsp; Many of these agents co-broke but instead of putting it up in the MLS (in this case or Queens LIBOR) they choose not to waste their time and go right to the source...LOCAL REALTORS THAT WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE QUALIFIED AND SERIOUS, READY TO DEAL BUYERS, NOT POSERS. I also wrote that many realtors will ask that their buyers show proof of funds and / or a pre-qualification before they show.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing wrong or illegal about that, regardless of what you may have been led to believe (am I reading between the lines???)&nbsp; I also think that any realtor showing properties to buyers of other agents without a pre-qualification letter or proof of funds is simply not looking out for the best interest of their clients and is setting themselves up for a whole list of abuse in the business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now going into giving myself credit...again what I posted was that I witnessed the abuses of Board and that unfortunately many local realtors have an edge over the &quot;outsider&quot;.&nbsp; As a byproduct of my posting I did many things but giving myself any credit was one thing I did not...LOL.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see, if I wanted to give myself credit I would have posted something like...&quot;list with me, I will find a buyer and I will get him approved by your Board&quot;...Now that would be crazy talk 80thstreet.&nbsp; In fact, I want to repeat that I GENERALLY DON&#039;T LIST PROPERTIES UNLESS THEY ARE SPONSOR OWNED UNITS.&nbsp; On occasion I will list a resale but only if I know the Board is fair and I am confident I can get someone approved without racism or prejudicial elements.&nbsp; Your building may follow a fair and level SOP for allowing shareholders but the realities of many other buildings differ from yours.&nbsp; I will not name certain Buildings because then I would be doing the same thing I posted against, posting names as if that would have no repercussions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am totally aware that different Coops observe different requirements but even then not knowing the Building can complicate matters. Yes, many Coop Boards are as fair as can be but many, and I mean many are guilty as charge.&nbsp; I believe that I made it clear that I have found myself hand picking resales because these practices are still rampant. I can write, not one posting but a books worth of the abuses that still exist in several Cooperatives.&nbsp; I have to admit that JH Cooperatives are a lot more compliant to the federal laws as it pertains to the &quot;protected classes&quot; but we are still a long way from equality and a level play field.<br /><br />Finally (for now, I think 80thstreet is going to keep me busy and 80thstreet did bring valid points to this subject) IT IS MY OPINION BASED ON CERTAIN REALITIES, it is better to know someone in the Board, or the Mgmt or at least some other shareholders that can expand your knowledge of the Building.&nbsp; This is important because offering plans, amendments, house rules and the financials are not going to tell you anything about the Building&#039;s admissions committee.&nbsp; Based on this very personal opinion that is something that is not likely to be happen with an outside broker. </strong> </em> &nbsp;

JMP99 does make a statement about co-brokering that as I mentioned, in theory works best to secure the highest offer possible for the seller and ultimately benefits the Industry&nbsp; In the businesses that I am involved in it would be unforgivable to simply start naming other realtors or environmental/construction firms in an attempt to trash them.&nbsp; Many may not agree, but that&#039;s what opinions are about.<br /><br />I think 80thstreet got what 80thstreet got out of the posting and it&#039;s OK.&nbsp; I think that my rebut touched on too many issues and I did not address the issue specifically. I also failed to quote JMP99 so that the &quot;loss in translation&quot; was evident.&nbsp; There is such a thing as too long a posting and I certainly crossed that line a long time ago...LOL&nbsp; It would take a whole lot of witting to get my views understood and even then, unless you have been there it may still be foggy. Ever heard of &quot;reading between the lines?&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s exactly what I did and I felt it necessary to unmask the posting for what I believe it really was and I will not apologize for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lets&#039; start with the co-broker or cooperating broker and the antitrust mentioned.&nbsp; By JMP99 stating that the mentioned local agents do not co-broke JMP99 simply showed disregard and in my opinion total disrespect for these hard working local brokers.&nbsp; Many of these agents co-broke but instead of putting it up in the MLS (in this case or Queens LIBOR) they choose not to waste their time and go right to the source...LOCAL REALTORS THAT WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE QUALIFIED AND SERIOUS, READY TO DEAL BUYERS, NOT POSERS. I also wrote that many realtors will ask that their buyers show proof of funds and / or a pre-qualification before they show.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing wrong or illegal about that, regardless of what you may have been led to believe (am I reading between the lines???)&nbsp; I also think that any realtor showing properties to buyers of other agents without a pre-qualification letter or proof of funds is simply not looking out for the best interest of their clients and is setting themselves up for a whole list of abuse in the business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now going into giving myself credit...again what I posted was that I witnessed the abuses of Board and that unfortunately many local realtors have an edge over the &quot;outsider&quot;.&nbsp; As a byproduct of my posting I did many things but giving myself any credit was one thing I did not...LOL.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see, if I wanted to give myself credit I would have posted something like...&quot;list with me, I will find a buyer and I will get him approved by your Board&quot;...Now that would be crazy talk 80thstreet.&nbsp; In fact, I want to repeat that I GENERALLY DON&#039;T LIST PROPERTIES UNLESS THEY ARE SPONSOR OWNED UNITS.&nbsp; On occasion I will list a resale but only if I know the Board is fair and I am confident I can get someone approved without racism or prejudicial elements.&nbsp; Your building may follow a fair and level SOP for allowing shareholders but the realities of many other buildings differ from yours.&nbsp; I will not name certain Buildings because then I would be doing the same thing I posted against, posting names as if that would have no repercussions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am totally aware that different Coops observe different requirements but even then not knowing the Building can complicate matters. Yes, many Coop Boards are as fair as can be but many, and I mean many are guilty as charge.&nbsp; I believe that I made it clear that I have found myself hand picking resales because these practices are still rampant. I can write, not one posting but a books worth of the abuses that still exist in several Cooperatives.&nbsp; I have to admit that JH Cooperatives are a lot more compliant to the federal laws as it pertains to the &quot;protected classes&quot; but we are still a long way from equality and a level play field.<br /><br />Finally (for now, I think 80thstreet is going to keep me busy and 80thstreet did bring valid points to this subject) IT IS MY OPINION BASED ON CERTAIN REALITIES, it is better to know someone in the Board, or the Mgmt or at least some other shareholders that can expand your knowledge of the Building.&nbsp; This is important because offering plans, amendments, house rules and the financials are not going to tell you anything about the Building&#039;s admissions committee.&nbsp; Based on this very personal opinion that is something that is not likely to be happen with an outside broker. </strong> </em> &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />NYC Native:<br /><br />It&#039;s an arduous task to follow your lengthy posts.&nbsp; You are incorrect by stating that I â€œsimply showed disregard&quot; for local realtors.&nbsp; To write that local brokers do not co-broke their listings is a fair criticism, not an attack, as you characterize it.&nbsp; This type of anti-competitive ideology is not so much about the survival of small firms anymore â€“ itâ€™s really about cashing in at the expense of an uninformed seller.&nbsp; Furthermore, when brokers donâ€™t allow the real estate community to participate in deals, i.e. â€œsharing commissions,â€ it hinders competition and ultimately retards prices.<br /><br />In Manhattan 99% of all residential real estate transactions are done as a result of co-brokering.&nbsp; Again, you are completely wrong by stating that co-brokering works only in â€œtheory.â€&nbsp; Also, a professional broker does not need to know co-op board members to do deals in different buildings. In fact, a knowledgeable, half-intelligent broker should be able to do deals in any borough and any building.&nbsp; NYC Native, your perspectives seem near sighted.<br /><br />Jackson Heightsâ€™ sellers:<br /><br />You need to know that co-brokering or when brokers invite the entire real estate community to bring their customers and participate in a sale, is essential to getting the best price for your properties.&nbsp; Donâ€™t believe the hype.

				I agree with jmp99.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with discussing the practices of local real estate firms <span class="bbc_u">by name</span>, whether the practice is good or bad.&nbsp; If NYC Native wants to be professionally courteous to his fellow brokers, that is certainly his choice.&nbsp; From my reading of jmp99&#039;s posts, there was no attempt to smear the character of any realtor.&nbsp; Even if jmp99 did discuss local real estate firms by name, jmp99 simply wrote about his or her understanding of the practices of local real estate firms.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think NYC Native again avoided the question of whether local real estate firms engage in anti-competitive practices.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the questions posed was: Whether local real estate agents engage in the practice of screening out offers or interests from potential buyers that are not represented by other local real estate agents.<br /><br />This question relates to anti-competitive behavior and possibly antitrust issues because if local brokers will only work with other local brokers in an (whether intentional or not) to keep larger agencies and non-local brokers from competing in JH, then the result may be: (1) sellers may not see a better offer (or even a higher offer) simply because a potential buyer was not represented by a local broker; (2) buyers won&#039;t have access to the market of JH properties without having to go through a local broker; (3) non-local brokers are unwilling to compete in marketing JH properties because they know they are being shut out by local brokers....all three results are a detriment to sellers and buyers alike!&nbsp; <br /><br />My reading of NYC Native&#039;s response seems to be that local brokers are somehow more likely to produce buyers that are <span class="bbc_u">serious </span> in their decision to buy and are more <span class="bbc_u">financially qualified</span>.&nbsp; This just does not seem true to me.&nbsp; First, asking a potential buyer to produce a letter from the bank to show that the potential buyer is pre-qualified is something ANY broker (local or non-local) can ask for.&nbsp; No one on this thread even suggested that a broker asking for a pre-qualification letter was somehow engaging in anything illegal or anti-competitive.&nbsp; So, NYC Native, this is not a matter of seeing things &quot;from your angle&quot;.&nbsp; Second, taking Manhattan as an example, I don&#039;t think a broker that works mostly in the Upper East Side is somehow going to produce buyers that are any more serious than buyers being represented by brokers that work mostly in Soho.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, my conclusion seems to be that NYC Native is dodging the question about possible anti-competitive behaviours by local brokers and trying to characterize the discussions on this thread as some kind of slander against individual local brokers.&nbsp; This is simply not the case.<br /><br />I&#039;d be HAPPY (even ecstatic)to find out that local brokers are NOT engaging in anti-competitive behavior.&nbsp; But if this is true, I&#039;d like it to be backed up by a little more than arguments such as (a) &quot;theories&quot; don&#039;t pan out, and (b) this discussion is &quot;trash talking&quot; other people.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m also trying to follow these posts.&nbsp; I want to start off by saying to jmp99 that I did not have a &quot;bad experience on the buying side of the equation.&quot;&nbsp; Quite the opposite.&nbsp; I posted on a different thread how impressed I was with quite a few of the local brokers.&nbsp; I looked at lots of apartments, and quite frankly, I felt that a trend had emerged.... the &quot;biggies&quot; trying to break into the local market were clueless.&nbsp; And several of them felt comfortable lying to hide their own ignorance.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not pretend to understand the intricacies of real estate practices.&nbsp; However, I know that the JH market has exploded in recent years, and although prices continue to be much much much cheaper than Park Slope or the Upper West side, I know that I recently saw a unit the same size and layout of my first apartment in JH on the market for more than 500% of the price I paid a little over a decade ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I suspect that prices will continue to climb.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would encourage buyers and sellers to do your homework.&nbsp; I looked at over 40 units when I was on the market, and I did not see any reason to have a &quot;buyer&#039;s agent&quot; representing me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to open houses, talked to neighbors, read the NY Times and Craigslist, etc.&nbsp; I did, however, have an excellent real estate attorney who specializes in coops, who was available to look at the paperwork for any building I was seriously considering.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I understand the benefit of having someone represent the buyer... and perhaps one of the experts here can explain it to me.<br /><br />For sellers...hey...if co-brokering is something that is important to you, then screen your selling agents before signing a contract, or stipulate that co-brokering is important to you and that you want the agent to be willing to split the commission.&nbsp; <br />

There is a degree of knowledge that can be gained by opening your eyes and mind to certain realities of the RE business that you obviously cant get from simply reading articles or &quot;breaking news&quot;.&nbsp; This may not be your fault since your experience in this Coop business may limited to serving on a Board and surfing the web.&nbsp; Maybe I am wrong and you do have more experience than what I give you credit for but they are so different than what I have experienced and your mind set is what it is.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that an obviously educated person like yourself can&#039;t see an innuendo when its written.&nbsp; If you think that it&#039;s OK to say &quot;this person doesn&#039;t co-broke&quot; or &quot;that person won&#039;t do this&quot; when in fact the statement lacks substance or is a TOTAL LIE than you had me fooled.&nbsp; I have had 2 of those Realtors email me and call my office to help sell their units.&nbsp; They offered splits I found almost offensive since they were charging low and sometimes grossly discounted commission.&nbsp; Some actually offered more realistic splits but again, it&#039;s not what I do.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t&nbsp; list re-sales, it&#039;s just not what I do.&nbsp; I deal with No-Board approval listings and it is the wishes of the SPONSORS that I deal with we do not MLS their units.&nbsp; At first I failed to see the wisdom of their wishes but soon I understood the method to the madness.&nbsp; We have consistently raised the value of our apartments and sold them much faster then most others would have selling the traditional way.&nbsp; I stand my ground, LOCAL REALTORS have an advantage to the outsiders and co-brokering should be offered but with very clear guidelines and methodology so as to avoid wasting everyone&#039;s time.&nbsp; This the option of the brokers and sellers but somehow you&#039;ve made it a &quot;antitrust&quot; issue because you brought it up and this is simply not the case.&nbsp; Sometimes sellers give the listing to every realtor in the area thus co-brokering is almost an impossibility since the listing is an &quot;Open Listing&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Folks, listen and hear the facts and not the HYPE!&nbsp; I am not a person you would call to list a property because this is not what I do.&nbsp; I encourage sellers to list with local brokers that may use or not the MLS their units but do not make the mistake of listing with someone outside your area just because they are a biggie and they are using the MLS.&nbsp; This won&#039;t sell your units, active marketing and hard work will.&nbsp; I personally know of a few biggies that simply listed properties and rarely did any selling.&nbsp; Their ideology was that if they listed 100 properties, throw them in the MLS pool and sold 10 themselves and co-broke 30 they were way ahead since they were getting paid anyway and didn&#039;t have to keep a big staff on.&nbsp; Whatever happened to the other 60 properties?&nbsp; They would re-list it with a lower price or the sellers got smart and went with an active local broker.&nbsp; <br /><br />The market is much different now a days but Coops are selling well and places like Jackson Heights will continue doing well as long as they are reasonable priced.&nbsp; My argument stands, even when local brokers don&#039;t officially co-broke they actually do most of the time.&nbsp; Sometimes they may wait a few days to call buyers that may be waiting and when they exhaust these option (usually a few days) they start calling local realtors to offer a co-broke.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with that or illegal for that matter regardless of what you read in Blogs.&nbsp; MLS is a great way to cover all bases in the marketing strategy but I always like to demystify any subject matter that I have <span class="bbc_u">real knowledge </span> of.&nbsp; I can go on and on about why brokers do this or that or why people&#039;s mind sets are what they are.&nbsp; But only experience and hands on can truly define the realities of any field or subject.<br /><br />As per &quot;dodging the question&quot;???&nbsp; What question?&nbsp; You seem fixated on this unrelated subject and have not read my entire posting and shoot from the hip like a cowboy on a mission.&nbsp; You can&#039;t make a proper assessment of what is posted by speed reading.&nbsp; I write with facts and not with something that is in the news and on the net and now <span class="bbc_u"><em><strong>&quot;I&#039;m an expert on the subject&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> </em> </span> Many times our government misses the target and sometimes by a long shot.&nbsp; True, there are those that have gone the wrong path and have engaged in unethical and questionable practices, but there is another side to some of the stories you read.&nbsp; Overzealous ADA&#039;s trying to make a name for themselves sometimes amplify certain truths to monumental heights.&nbsp; That&#039;s why some laws are deemed unconstitutional and Rules and Regulations are constantly being revised and changed to rectify or to right a wrong..&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a good intention mushrooms to a witch hunt faster than I can finish up a whole bottle of Montepulsiano.</span><br />&nbsp;;)&nbsp;
