					This is early to get out there, but these classes are definitely happening and might appeal to parents who want to maintain and enhance their kids&#039; writing skills even during the hot days of July and August. One class meets weekly on 6 Fridays starting July 13, and the other is a 2-week intensive during the first two weeks of August.&nbsp; <br /><br />Location for both classes is a loft/studio space in Long Island City, Queens, very near stops for the the 7, M, E, F, R, and G trains.<br /><br />Instructor for both is Tim Fredrick, PhD, who has taught elementary, middle, and high school students, as well as college undergraduates and graduates. Through his wide range of experience, he is very knowledgeable about how language is acquired, how literacy is improved, and the latest best practices for encouraging both. He has exceptional rapport with students, and is extremely effective at helping kids learn to love reading and writing. He has a masterâ€™s degree in English Education, and a PhD in Applied Linguistics from New York University. Dr. Fredrick has been published in international academic journals and regularly presents (in the United States and abroad) his research on language use.<br /><br />&nbsp;For more information, contact <a href="mailto:tim.fredrick@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">tim.fredrick@gmail.com</a><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>â€œWhatâ€™s Wrong with This Place?â€</strong></span><br /><em>Reading and Writing about Dystopian Society<br /></em><br />Ages 11 and up<br /><br />If the popularity of the Hunger Games series reminds us of anything, it is that kids love to read about dystopian societies. These books are not only entertaining and capture kidsâ€™ imaginations, they offer a great opportunity to learn about our own society and to consider what an ideal one would look like. <br /><br />In this 6-week course, students will read three young-adult dystopian novels:&nbsp; the new modern classics Feed by M. T. Anderson and The House of Scorpions by Nancy Farmer, and the classic The Lord of the Flies by William Golding. They will discuss the books and the larger issues they bring up, like What does it mean to be civil? and If you could start your own society over again, how would you do it?&nbsp; Students will write an essay on one or more of the books and receive targeted instructor feedback on organization, grammar, spelling, and style.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;What&#039;s Wrong with this Place?&quot; will also have an online discussion board that supplements the group&#039;s in-person discussions and activities, as well as enables absent students to remain very involved in the class.<br /><br />6 Fridays starting July 13th--10 a.m. to 12 noon<br /><br />$200 per student. Limit 10 students; if interest exceeds this number, a second section, running 1-3 p.m. on Fridays, will be added.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Telling Stories on the Screen</strong></span><br /><em>Digital Storytelling</em><br /><br />Ages 8 and up<br /><br />Storytelling is an innate human activity, so it is no wonder that with the rise of digital technology like cameras and computers, our definition of storytelling has expanded.&nbsp; <br /><br />In this intensive two-week course, students will learn various ways to tell stories using digital technology like cameras, flip cams, and computers. They will start off the workshop by telling a story through images only, then add narration to a slide show of images, and finally collaborate with classmates to create a silent movie. Through learning and improving various computer skills, students will also expand their notion of what it means to tell a story. <br /><br />Monday-Thursday for 2 weeks (8 sessions) starting August 6th--10 a.m. â€“ 12 noon<br /><br />$250 per student. Limit 6 students

					Creative Expressions<br /><br />This 8-week after-school guides student-writers--enthusiastic and reluctant alike--toward the skill, and joy, of using language creatively to express ideas, feelings, and experiences. Instructor Tim Fredrick brings humor and pinpoint precision to assessing and teaching a small group of students, who come together weekly for a series of exercises that will hone their ability to play with language and discover new ways to use words and sentences. The ongoing result is greater mindfulness of word choice, expressive connections, and the confidence that comes from improvement in these areas.<br /><br />At the end of the course, students will present works from their final portfolios and walk away with the awareness that they can apply their growing skills to all types of writing and presentation formats.<br /><br />Topics Explored:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>rhyme scheme<br />perspective writing<br />found poetry<br />micro-fiction.</li><li></li></ul><br />Monday afternoons, 3:45-4:45 at the LIC Art Center, 44-02 23rd Street, 2nd floor.

That school, Queens Paideia, has fast become a place to admire because of its:<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5:1 student-to-teacher ratio<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individualized learning plans <br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic excellence combined with a whole-child orientation <br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affordable tuition<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis on the arts, environmental awareness, and healthful living<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15-20 minute commute from many parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn<br /><br />At QPS, a 5:1 student-to-teacher ratio enables us to know every childâ€™s temperament, strengths, weaknesses, and interests, and thus to create personalized learning plans for them.

					BOOKS FOR TREES <br />A read-a-thon to benefit Queens Botanical Garden <br />October 2010 <br /><br />Queens Paideia School in LIC is launching a 12-week long read-a-thon to benefit Queens Botanical Garden, which suffered great losses to its trees and grounds during Septemberâ€™s tornado. All students, regardless of where they go to school, may help&nbsp; raise money for this worthy cause right here in Queens. It is also an opportunity for them to make the connection between trees and books and to then reverse it and have books be&nbsp; a way to bring about more trees. <br /><br /><strong>How does it work?</strong> <br />Students who participate in BOOKS FOR TREES commit to keeping a log of the books they read between November 1, 2010, and January 21, 2011. They ask people they knowâ€”family, friends, and neighborsâ€”to sponsor an amount for each book they read or to pledge a flat&nbsp; amount in support of the readerâ€™s commitment to this great cause. <br /><br />Then the fun begins! Sponsors sign on and students start the 12-week journey of tracking what they read and how their actions will translate into much-needed funds for Queens Botanical Garden. At the end of the read-a-thon, students let sponsors know that the reading period is over, which books they have read, and where donors can send their final pledges. All participants will receive a letter of thanks from Queens Botanical Garden in recognition of their achievement. <br /><br /><strong>To join BOOKS FOR TREES read-a-thon </strong><br />Contact Queens Paideia at <a href="mailto:tqps@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">tqps@earthlink.net</a> to receive an e-packet that will make this a straightforward process, including a sponsor form, reading log, and templates for letters to approach potential donors and to later let them know that the read-a-thon is over. The e-packet also contains suggestions for how to encourage a student to write his or her own letters. <br /><br />We hope you will join us in rebuilding our boroughâ€™s most cherished garden and in rethinking&nbsp; the relationship between books and trees. <br /><br /><strong>Queens Paideia School <br /><a href="mailto:tqps@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">tqps@earthlink.net</a> <br />queenspaideiaschool.org </strong><br />

					I&#039;m posting to let people know about an excellent beginner ballet class I am taking in LIC, at LIC School of Ballet. It&#039;s on Wednesdays 1-2 and is for adults who have had some lessons in their past, even distant.&nbsp; This class is so amazing and has been life-changing for me in terms of how I relate to and use my body. The instructor is a Balanchine-trained dancer who is extremely clear in her teaching style and very supportive as a person. If you want to do something nice for yourself, once a week, and get over to LIC, it&#039;s truly worth it!<br />

Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@differentdirections.org" class="bbc_email">info@differentdirections.org</a> for registration and information.<br /><br />Theater Arts and Performance &nbsp;This class will involve all aspects of theater production and culminate in the world-premiere performance of a musical written specifically for it! &nbsp;During the first semester (Sept-Dec) the class will work on acting skills and character development through improv and theater games that guide them toward creating short plays with roles for everyone. &nbsp;Over the winter break, an original musical will be written for the students based on observations of their unique talents and acting strengths. The class will rehearse, stage, and create sets during the second semester and perform for friends and family in May.<br /><br />R-J Houston, founding partner and the Artistic Director of Different Directions, leads the class. With a theater and arts background that includes ten years as a professional dancer with various ballet companies and membership in both SAG and AFTRA, Mrs. Houston moved behind the scenes as choreographer and director of nine student productions before starting Different Directions.<br /><br />Ross Wade, author and librettist, developed his fun and engaging approach to writing original musicals, called Character Craft, while running the Lunchbox Theatre Outreach Program at Sarah Lawrence College. He will be writing the original musical to be performed by the students.<br /><br />Ages 6-12, Wednesdays 3:30â€“5:30 pm <br />Sept 22, 2010 â€“ May 11, 2011<br />Cost: $600<br /><br />Beginning Stage Combat &nbsp;Fake fighting has been around since before Shakespeareâ€™s time, but the Bard upped the ante because he knew that audiences love a good fight! In these classes, students will learn the basics of both clown combat and realistic fighting in a safe, fun, and non-confrontational environment. <br /><br />T-J Glenn is a Brooklyn native who has traveled the world for 30 years as a stuntman, fight choreographer, and author of more than 20 books, including one on Japanese stage combat. He is also a veteran actor of more than 60 films, dozens of TV shows, and hundreds of live shows.<br /><br />Ages 8â€“12, Monday 4:30â€“5:30 PM Sept 20 - Dec 13<br />Cost: &nbsp;$200<br />

					Please see (click) the URL below to learn about a new school forming in Queens. It&#039;s the first new school in the area in a very long time, and a unique one at that. While its initial student pool will be small, it could pave the way for something larger within itself or be modeled by other parents who are feeling frustrated by the current, and very limited, options in the area right now. <br /><br /><a href="http://yournabe.com/articles/2009/02/25/forest_hills_ledger/news/forest_hills_ledger_newsiuhukgm02252009.txt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://yournabe.com/articles/2009/02/25/forest_hills_ledger/news/forest_hills_ledger_newsiuhukgm02252009.txt</a><br /><br />One aspect not mentioned in the online article is the key role of parents in creating the Queens Paideia School (QPS). Those parents already on board are actively involved in its formation--ranging from developing an application process for new students, the hiring criteria for teachers, and strategizing on the array of materials that will ultimately be used for the students&#039; learning.<br />
