				DSSJH,<br /><br />Yes, because suing and calling a property owner an &quot;Art murdered&quot; is very mature. Especially when they are one of the few buildings that allow this &quot;Art&quot; in the entire city. Just a bad look for the &quot;art movement&quot; in my mind. <br /><br /><br /><br />I know I have no ability :) Thank You for confirming that I just hope my mom still loves me

				Hey, that&#039;s great.<br /><br />The artists should buy a building which could be their new graffiti hub.<br /><br />Here in Jackson Heights would be awesome.<br /><br />(But I doubt Jackson Heights is on their radar.

If it had been written into the contact that the work could be destroyed upon sale or demolition of the building, then the lawsuit would not have happened. And future building owners can still allow artists to tag or paint on their buildings without fear of this kind of lawsuit, provided they have an appropriate contract that the artist signs. <br /><br />The artist would of course also need to get a lawyer to review the contract to make sure the building owner doesn&#039;t have any intentions of infringing on the copyright of the work (which should belong to the artist) such as in this case in Brooklyn. <br /><br />https://news.artnet.com/art-world/street-artist-sues-real-estate-developer-for-using-mural-in-ads-229475 <br /><br />If the contract has terms in it the artist doesn&#039;t like, then he/she should find another building to paint on.<br /><br />

				It looks like the owner/demolisher is appealing, so the artists may not get that money after all. Or at least, not as much.<br /><br />https://ny.curbed.com/2018/2/20/17033348/5-pointz-lawsuit-graffiti-artist-settlement-appeal<br /><br />Shelby2, from what I&#039;ve read about the original understanding between the owner and the artists, neither side probably ever gave the idea of a written contract a thought. It was a congenial agreement. And sure, the artists knew that eventually the building would come down, but in the beginning I doubt they had any idea how extensive the graffiti would become, or the way it would help draw attention to the neighborhood—making it possible for the owner to construct his 1,200 luxury high-rise apartments and count on getting high market-rate rents using the 5 Pointz name as a selling point (or five).<br /><br />Like a lot of people, I was surprised by the amount awarded to the artists—actually, I was surprised that they won in the first place. I guess both the jury and the judge were satisfied that the art on the building was covered by the Visual Artists Rights Act. And I&#039;m sure the amount reflects the fact that the owner whitewashed the art <em>in the middle of the night</em>, with no warning to the artists, which was the worst slap in the face to them. It should at least discourage other building owners from destroying artists&#039; work without proper notice. <br /><br />According to the Times, right after the whitewashing, &quot;Mr. Wolkoff said he decided that painting over the art at night without fanfare or notice was the kindest way to end an era.&quot; What BS. At least, a few years later, he partly acknowledged that he did it to put a stop to &quot;confrontations&quot;: &quot;Mr. Wolkoff said he had chosen a stealth whitewashing option to avoid further confrontations and to spare everyone — himself included — the pain of seeing the painted walls being pulled down.&quot; (Ach! The poor guy!)<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/nyregion/5pointz-a-graffiti-mecca-in-queens-is-wiped-clean-overnight.html<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/nyregion/5pointz-graffiti-artists-whose-works-were-erased-will-get-day-in-court.html

				&nbsp;&quot;It should at least discourage other building owners from destroying artists&#039; work without proper notice.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Seems like any future building owner would learn the lesson here that trying to allow &quot;art&quot; on private property is a huge liability and from a dollars and cents perspective not worth the risk.<br /><br />To me it&#039;s not wholly different from you letting my kids draw chalk on your driveway and deciding one day to hose it off. You property, your rights. Clearly, the courts disagree which is their right and i don&#039;t begrudge them. That said, why would any business in their right mind allow something similar in the future?<br /><br /><br /><br />

Revok — the moniker of LA-based artist Jason Williams — had noticed that graffiti he had painted on a handball court in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, had served as the backdrop for an H&amp;M photoshoot. In January, he sent the company a cease and desist letter, demanding that it stop circulating the images on social media and also compensate him. In an initial response, H&amp;M denied his claims, arguing that the graffiti, which covers New York City property, is vandalism, and that Revok has no copyright rights to assert.
