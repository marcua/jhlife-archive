			This NY Times blog article starts out talking about JH luring suburban customers to its ethnic stores.<br />http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/are-ethnic-shopping-strips-luring-suburban-customers/<br /><br />It puts only a positive spin on it from the point of view of bringing money into the city from the suburbs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it mentions the strain on the neighborhood from the congestion/traffic point of view.

			Can&#039;t have everything. Lots of new people moving into JH seem to complain about this (at the same time, they love the food). Most who have lived here for some time have become desensitized about it. Best best, drive down 35th or 34th ave. if you want avoid congestion/traffic.

			I&#039;ve lived in new york all of my life and I&#039;m tired of hearing people say, &quot;That&#039;s life in the big city. There&#039;s nothing you can do.&quot; Being &quot;desensitized&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;hiding your head in the sand&quot;. People in every neighborhood have a responsibility to protect the things they love and fight against the things that take away from their quality of life.

			JH is becoming a popular town. People are going to come like it or not. It helps bring in money to the community which helps in vitalizing the community.&nbsp; It just so happens that the &quot;main street&quot; area happens to run across two streets which is Roosevelt and 37th ave, unlike areas like Corona which run down Junction Blvd. Yeah, 37th ave was a very street say 20 years ago. I say if people are that upset about it, I would suggest speak up at your next community board meeting. That why we have public officials. They&#039;re not their to make appearances at annnual Halloween parades.<br /><br />

			Speaking up is exactly what I&#039;m talking about. I have no problem with people coming in to Jackson heights to shop, eat or live. My problem is with people who disrespect the neighborhood by selling drugs, writing graffiti, or double parking and honking their horns illegally.
