				Not sure whether members will be relieved or disappointed, but Jackson Heights didn&#039;t make the list of top five gentrifying neighborhoods, according to Curbed.com.&nbsp; Borough Park did, though.<br />http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/08/18/these_five_neighborhoods_are_gentrifying_the_most_right_now.php#reader_comments<br /><br />Apparently the only measure they used for gentrification is % increase in home prices from 2013 to 2014.

				All of these neighborhoods went from unaffordable to more unaffordable. Seems like the gentrification has already happened.

				I hope Jackson Heights never becomes gentrified. Love the diversity. Such a unique neighborhood that can&#039;t be found anywhere else. <br /><br />BTW, Why can&#039;t a home just be a home? A place where experiences are shared and memories made? Why does everything have to be reduced to a financial value? My parents and grandparents lived in their homes for decades and never mentioned home valuations once. It was their home, case closed.

				I think the good people of Jackson Heights are investing more into their hood. We have good leaders who care about safety, recreation, the environment and so on. We still have a nice representation of all kinds of people (meaning all socioeconomic, ethnic, age, etc.)&nbsp; I grew up in this neighborhood and when it came down to decide where I should get an affordable, safe, but culturally rich neighborhood to raise my son and enjoy living with my girlfriend I decided to stay home, Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to be here.&nbsp; We have faults and positive aspects to the neighborhood like anywhere else.&nbsp; But no matter how many times Ive seen/heard people moving on to the suburbs, larger homes, quieter areas, trendier places..the common trend I always hear about old stories and memories stem back to their time in Jackson Heights...
