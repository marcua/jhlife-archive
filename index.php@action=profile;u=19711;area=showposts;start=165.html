I believe most buyers in Jackson Heights want to live like a family. Do we seriously like to live like a dorm town in Manhattan so the brokers can jack up the price as high in Manhattan?&nbsp; If that happens, most family will go to other areas for example (Forest Hills, Rego Park, Elmhurst) to find real homes.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry for chiming in a little late on this subject, I noticed that Aram already pulled some examples. Fair Housing practices dictate that as licensees we don&#039;t make a distinction in the familial status, same way as race, gender, profession etc... We qualify our buyers based on credit worthiness and the boards make the ultimate determination. <br /><br />I want to be clear that I see jh_coop_buyer&#039;s point of view, and that the presumption is that the price is being inflated by the marketing description. Let me assure you again, the asking price of the unit is exactly equal to the recent sales of a similar 1 bedroom unit in the same building, which my partner and I sold 4 units in the last year, and the highest sale of a one bedroom is attributed to another broker whom we highly respect. The work was done by a building approved contractor, and similar conversion was done in the unit one floor below and&nbsp; in one other listing we currently represent, so it&#039;s not an anomaly or an inflation by any measure. <br /><br />My advice to all buyers is - BUY. There are very qualified buyers coming into Jackson Heights with an average household income of $120,000-160,000, and inevitably you will see owners looking for higher premium for their apartments as the demand increases. And as long as the banks appraisals support the values, prices will rise. With the feds continuing to buy 40 billion dollars in mortgage loans from the agencies, the rates will continue to stay low continuing to aid the increase in values. <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jacksonheightslistings.com</a><br /><br />

Somehow, the trick of misleading information or stretching the facts too much turns me away immediately. For example, you have listed the apartment 35-36 76th Street, #323 as a two bedroom apartment.&nbsp; Anybody looking at the floor can only consider it as &quot;ONE&quot; bedroom apartment. The dinning area can not be considered a separate bedroom (the flex room is such a fancy word). Even for a junior 4 in most jackson heights coop buildings, the dinning room that can be also served as a bedroom has its own walls and its closet and the kitchen has its own window. <br /><br />The floor plan is attached here so other people may examine it. I am hoping the reply does not get eliminated and you may revise your list to make my claim sounds unfounded and this is the last post I will comment on you web listing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Aram,<br />This is a chalelnging line to market and several buildings in the heighs have them. Most owners of these lines have gone through great effort to create custom doors in effort to transform them into guest bedrooms, offices or baby rooms. It&#039;s that property that&#039;s safely a one with an eat-in kitchen but understated, or a property that is being used in its current configuration as a flex 2 and obviously overstated as a 2 bed. As you know 1.5 bed is not an available search engine option <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> Wish it was. In case of this unit, this flex bedroom functions as a baby room. We&#039;ve done our best to convey the propertie&#039;s descrition in the copy and by providing detailed visuals, including big bold FLEX 2 in the headline. It&#039;s priced and comped against 1 bedrooms. The suggestion of that section being used as a bedroom also came from the building&#039;s original plan which I will attach. The description of flex two that I found reads as follows: &quot;A Convertible 2-Bedroom or &quot;flex 2&quot; is a large 1-bedroom with a dining room or enough space to create a wall for a second bedroom.&quot; <br /><br /><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/?attachment_id=2946" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/?attachment_id=2946</a>

					This is certainly a fun subject to flex a real estate intellectual muscle &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> but it&#039;s no secred that all buyers share the concern of a secure investment and some kind of sense as to where their montlies are headed after purchase. &nbsp;If they start high their exposure is certainly higher. High maintenance is not only a red flag but a buyer repellant in most cases especially in a marketplace where lower maintenances are generally expected. <br /><br />There is a difference in several building rules such as sublet or pet policies, which ultimately affect them on resale. It&#039;s also NOT common for buyers to retain attorneys before there is an accepted offer or a contract, so having a broker familiar with the buildign and a skill set to do some due diligence to provide an opinion helps at least in the pre-screening stages. The attorneys always have the last say in NY anyway. A lot of information is public and we have complete data on 27 prime buildings on our site alone: <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/buildings/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/buildings/</a><br /><br />We put up more updates as we do deals or have to repull information on each individual building. We also had our partner in lending screen them for financing approval, and even though bank approvals have expiration dates, they look quite strong. <br /><br />What I would do if I were the buyer, I would select the section of Jackson Heights that I want to be in, draw a target parameter, identify the buildings in it and have them all researched, and then look for individual units in the pre-screened buildings. It will save A LOT of time and will ultimately raise buyer confidence. <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jacksonheightslistings.com</a>

					Comping in Jackson Heights can be tricky as there are units that on paper fit the profile but may differ in condition by a mile. Unless you get visuals with the data it&#039;s hard to see it as a true comp. If you are buying a renovated unit, it&#039;s important that you find renovated units to compare your purchase to, and be sure to make proper adjustments for the floor and monthly maintenance. Same goes for fixers (which can be tricky because boards may take issue with low sales price) - find similar fixers to compare them to. My partner and I specialize in renovated units, and go to great lengths to find comps in order to supply them to the appraiser later on...<br /><br />With every building that you get interested in find out who it&#039;s managed by, and call the management to get the list of recent sales - MANY OF THEM ARE NOT PROPERLY RECORDED IN PUBLIC RECORDS - don&#039;t ask me why, but it still helps to see public records on a building before you consider bidding on one. Management keeps completer records, and they will assist in giving you an idea as to what the range the unit can sell for (hopefully you&#039;ll get someone friendly <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />. <br /><br />Having a buyer broker always helps in this regard, and I agree with Aram that it&#039;s not always cost efficient, especially in a non-cooperative deal. But getting a deal to stick is at the best price is understanding exactly how much leverage you have in the negotiation and how far you can push the envelope not to upset the coop board. <br /><br />I say use every resource available, get as much information as you can to raise your comfort level, and proceed forward.<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jacksonheightslistings.com</a><br />

					Well said Aram!<br /><br />My business partner and I entered the Jackson Heights market several years ago and by staying true to our iron clad cooperation policy have gained tremendous momentum and the trust of the sellers. Along the way also met agents who share our philosophy, and we share our listings with all licensees who have been active in the neighborhood regardless of their cobroking practices. <br /><br />You can find great inventory by visiting our site: <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jacksonheightslistings.com</a> where we post our exclusives. We have several more coming on Monday, so feel free to get in touch.<br /><br />Warm regards,<br />Armen &amp; Armen<br />

					Even though my partner and I generally don&#039;t do many rentals, we recently took a coop rental listing, a 1 bedroom converted to 2 (JR 4) at $1995/mo, fully convinced we will be struggling against what we knew rental prices to be in the heights. In less than one month we got a full price offer after twelve showings. We also checked with some local small landlords for availability of 2 bedrooms, it appeared they started pricing above 2k. Calls are still coming in on the 2 bed we rented, so as the demand increases it&#039;s inevitable that the prices will rise. <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jacksonheightslistings.com</a>

					Hi all,<br /><br />I looked it up, the way I am reading this is that the building class and use must have been grandfathered in. The ZONING is R5 - Low Density RESIDENTIAL, building CLASS however is an O9 - Misc Office Use. One other thing that looks odd is that according to the current ZONING maximum FAR (the maximum building size) is capped at 1.25 but the actual size of the building is 1.38 - HIGHER than the zoning actually allows - the size may be grandfathered in as well. <br /><br />So if let&#039;s say a developer wanted to buy this building and build up they would have the difficult task of changing the zoning including the max FAR in order to build a larger structure. If someone were to rebuild a building on this property they would have to put up something even smaller according to the current zoning, and it would have to be something residential, not commercial without getting special permission from the city.<br /><br />If this is being priced for an investor interested in collecting rents, then the rent roll should produce a minimum 3% capitalization rate to make any sense to an investor. Now presuming that this is a 4 unit income producing property that has an annual rent roll of say $80,000 max and expenses of a minimum of 40,000 considering taxes alone are 23k annually. the max return per year on this property is $40,000 to 50,000 max. It won&#039;t yield more than 1.7-2%. This will be a tough sell to an investor in my opinion also. Even if they except the zoning issues, they would submit offers based strictly on the rent roll, most likely in the 1.8-1.9mm range at best. <br /><br />Considering this property was purchased for 1.6mm plus closing costs in 2005 (at the height of the market) I can see why the seller needs to price high. Then again, if the target is the commercial market listing price is arbitrary as it is always ignored by investors, and offers are made according to the math I listed in the above paragraph.<br /><br />In case you guys are interested in seeing the public records on this building, see below:<br /><br />Building Information<br />Building Class (View List)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O9<br />(MISC.

					Many of our clients often ask about home security systems, especially for windows facing the fire escape. I happen to know for a fact that Exit Realty has made a great effort to get discounted rates and free installation for our new and prospective clients by using the leverage of our 1700 offices in US and in Canada. I am curious to know if this is something that is needed in Jackson Heights and see if I can bring that deal Jackson Heights residents. <br /><br />Armen J.

					Hello everyone!<br /><br />I am a real estate broker, and as part of my job I read a multitude of publications. The one I like to read most in regards to coops (which are most of my business in Jackson Heights specifically) is called the Cooperator. It began as a print publication and is now available on line. I keep an archive of the articles that address common questions.<br /><br />Here is the article that specifically addresses this subject:<br /><br /><a href="http://cooperator.com/articles/1564/1/Rules-and-Problems/Page1.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://cooperator.com/articles/1564/1/Rules-and-Problems/Page1.html</a><br /><br />Warm regards,<br />Armen J.
