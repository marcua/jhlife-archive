			Hello! Iâ€™m Dr. Joel Pierson and I run NYCPianoDoctor - a music studio that connects aspiring students with myself and my team of teachers. We are currently accepting new students. Check us out! www.nycpianodoctor.com<br /><br />Music lessons with us are:<br />- Unique - We cater our teaching to the needs of our students, and make sure that students are playing pieces that want to play.<br />- Flexible - We offer both in-person or virtual lessons, and adapt our teaching methods to the strengths of our students. <br />- Fun - We use a method I have developed to help students focus on learning and not get bored in their lessons. We do not adhere to the &quot;just play it again&quot; style of teaching!<br /><br />I have a BA in Classical Piano, an MA in Jazz Piano, and a Ph.D. in Music Composition. My teachers all have advanced degrees in music, are active performers, and are adept at teaching both traditional and contemporary music. All teachers are fully vaccinated!<br /><br />Want to get in touch?&nbsp; Visit www.nycpianodoctor.com and send us a note!<br />
