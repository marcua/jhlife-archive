			Good morning everyone,<br /><br />We have been renting out art studios in Woodside since 2009. We kept the rent super reasonable all these years and some of our tenants have been with us since we have opened. Our studios are on the second floor of a commercial building, with 24/7 access, heat, and AC all year around. Woodside is developing rapidly with small businesses, eateries, and restaurants. We are conveniently located on 55th Street, close to the M and the R stop, 10 min by biking, and 15 min walking from Jackson Heights.<br /><br />We are now offering a few rentals and share opportunities:<br />&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp; One studio with skylight, 19&#039; x 12&#039;, ready to be occupied on January 1, 2020. All studios are completely private, have 24/7 access, skylights (no windows), heat, and AC all year around. <br /><br />2. My former, sunny studio (5 windows!!!), has been rented to a local artist who works in the mornings. If you are looking for a studio share in a lovely, sun-filled studio, and perhaps you work on weekends, afternoons, and evenings, this be the perfect spot for you!<br /><br />3. One-month half-price sublet, January 1-30th, at the new wing, as the tenant will be only moving in February. 1st.<br /><br /><br />For all inquiries, prices, and details please get in touch directly: deborahwasserman.art@gmail.com.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Happy holidays!!!<br /><br />Deb<br />
