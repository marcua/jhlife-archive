				Terrible news. First Starbucks on 75th &amp; Roosevelt now another Chipotle to go with Target. <br /><br />More chains coming to the area at a time when independent and mom and pop businesses are suffering.

				Chipotle stockholders have been significantly rewarded.&nbsp; In the past 52 weeks the stock has increased from $415.00 to $997.44 (a few minutes ago) an increase of 240%.&nbsp; Just two weeks ago it was $1,087.00.&nbsp; An amazing company.&nbsp;

				Omg what is UP with everyone in this neighborhood? Seriously the complaining is out of control. If Chipotle isn&#039;t your thing, don&#039;t go. They, along with Starbucks, will be hiring, likely locally, during a time when unemployment is rampant. Let&#039;s be positive about that. <br /><br />Given the line around the block at Starbucks on 37th Ave, I would venture to say that it&#039;s well-received here.

People are free to choose where to spend their $&#039;s. It appears that some would like to force others where to spend their $&#039;s.<br /><br />The customers in places like Chipotle and Starbucks are truly diverse. That&#039;s what I&#039;ve noticed. South Asian mixed with Asian mixed with Latinx etc&nbsp; in equal proportions. It&#039;s less integrated in other establishments.<br /><br />These chains appear to be the true melting pots of America.<br /><br />Simply an observation.
