					Its great when Senator Jose Peralta posts a random comment, because it really helps to see how ridiculous his positions are when they are in black or white.<br /><br />1) Senator, which one is it ? You tout that you helped deliver thousands of school seats in the last 13 years, yet you also said you abandoned the Democratic party because you couldn&#039;t get anything done and you needed to have a coalition with Republicans, so how did you pull that off being in the Democratic conference for the last 13 years.<br /><br />2) Senator, which one is it ? You attack the Democrats for proposing a budget that fully funds NYC schools because the Senate Republicans wont vote for it, but you said by joining the Republicans you could get them to vote for things they didn&#039;t want to vote for.<br /><br />3) Senator, which one is it ? You attack you&#039;re constituents who showed up to you&#039;re Town Hall and are now calling you out on education funding as being outsiders and agitators, but now you say its the Democratic conference thats actually behind all the criticism against you.<br /><br />4) Senator, which one is it ? You now say that there is no working Democratic majority so you joined the Republicans to make things happen for you&#039;re constituents, but the proposed budget has less funding for NYC schools than LI and upstate school, there is no Dream Act, no GENDA, no campaign finance reform, no rent protections, and no clarity on Raise the Age.<br /><br />Senator, which one is it ? Now we all know which on it is. You&#039;re a Republican. <br /><br />

Jose Peralta out of the Queens Democratic Party, saying his membership in a group of renegade Dems called the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) is thwarting progressive goals.<br /><br />Activists in Peralta’s district, centered in Jackson Heights, have been furious since he joined the IDC, which is allied to majority Republicans in the state Senate. They say the alliance is empowering Republicans to assist President Trump’s agenda on the state level, a charge they refute.<br /><br />“We want everyone to see what’s happening,” said Jackson Heights resident Susan Kang, 36, who signed a March 1 letter urging the Democratic Organization of Queens County to eject the lawmaker.<br /><br />

					BehrenNow: Nothing has changed. This is exactly the same thing that Republican John Flanagan said 3 months ago. He is open to doing something on Raise the Age. And they will do &quot;something&quot;, which wont be much. This is no victory for the IDC. Its a made up press strategy which some of us called out months ago. <br /><br />If the reporter was doing his job, he would be reporting on the Albany disappearing act. Which is how did Jose Peralta and the IDC make the following disappear: Dream Act, Women&#039;s Equality Act,&nbsp; Campaign Finance Reform, Single Payer Healthcare, full funding of NYC schools ?<br /><br />Oh yeah, next year. They will win the big half measure of Raise the Age and then we can all once again wait for next year. While they dine on perks, power and privileges granted to them by the Republicans. No one is falling for this routine again.

					Its nice to see Jose Peralta pointing to their own press releases as &quot;evidence.&quot; Here are some more independent sources:<br /><br />The most terrifying thing is the IDC has assisted the Republicans in moving money out of public schools and into charter schools.<br /><br />&quot;Although the preliminary budget forecast of charter school enrollment is lower than projected by IBO, the Department of Education’s (DOE) budget for charter school tuition in 2018 represents a $138 million increase over the current year’s figure. This increase reflects not only enrollment growth,<br />but an anticipated increase in the state-approved per-pupil tuition rate for charter schools.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/report-charter-schools-poised-to-take-a-much-bigger-bite-out-of-nycs-budget-9790408" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.villagevoice.com/news/report-charter-schools-poised-to-take-a-much-bigger-bite-out-of-nycs-budget-9790408</a>

					Another good Democrat elected to the Senate. Where is Jose Peralta ?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2017/03/benjamin-says-hell-join-mainline-conference/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2017/03/benjamin-says-hell-join-mainline-conference/</a><br /><br />&quot;Brian Benjamin, the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat vacated last month by Bill Perkins, pledged in a statement released Monday to join the mainline Democratic conference.&quot;

Their new ally is the &quot;IDC.&quot; If you got one of Jose Peralta&#039;s recent fliers, these are the people who paid for it. I hope the authorities investigate this.<br /><br />&quot;As of last year, the Independence Party has entered into a relationship with the Independent Democratic Conference, the eight-member group of breakaway Democrats that has aligned with Senate Republicans. The Independence Party is allowing the IDC to use its status as a statewide political party to give it access to a campaign account that can take six-figure donations and spend unlimited sums for its members, something the IDC could not otherwise do under election law.&quot;<br /><br />

Which is exactly how much credibility the people of New York should give Alcantara’s vicious and juvenile response.<br /><br />

					To be 100 percent clear because mis-information is being put out on this site:<br /><br />The Democratic budget resolution was BANNED from being introduced and no Senators were allowed to vote on it.<br /><br />This is unprecedented and against the Senate rules. Instead the Republicans introduced both their and the IDC bills up for a vote.<br /><br />So we understand what happened here, the IDC was complicit in preventing the Democratic bill from being put up to a vote and were part and parcel of a sham process that allowed them to &quot;vote&quot; for a watered down version of the &quot;Dream Act&quot; which was in the IDC budget resolution.<br /><br />That is Senator Jose Peralta&#039;s big &quot;seat at the table.&quot; Disgusting.

					Holy cow. I just noticed an earlier post by SD13. It does not even mention Jose Peralta. Its a press release that only mentions Jeff Klein. Wow, they have completely written off Jose Peralta. Now its only about saving Jeff Klein&#039;s reputation in the senate district.

					Sorry, but thats just empty words.<br /><br />The Democratic resolution wasn&#039;t even allowed to be voted on. The IDC said nothing. As for the IDC bill, it was a bad bill, why would they vote for it. Why didn&#039;t the IDC demand that the Democratic bill be allowed to be voted on ? Thats the bill they wanted to pass, right. So why didn&#039;t they use their relationship with the Republicans to let it be voted on ? Its all bunch of hocus pocus baloney. Everyone knows that now.<br /><br />Anyway, Peralta is totally oblivious or I assume they told him they would hire him when he loses. He really thinks that this silly debate of IDC versus mainline Democrats will help him ? Democrats will be won back with these silly maneuvers ? Hilarious. How many people are out there defending him who aren&#039;t on the IDC payroll ? Zero. Not one.<br /><br /><br />
