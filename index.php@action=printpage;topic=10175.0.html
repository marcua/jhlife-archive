				For anyone wanting to take a drive, the Queens County Farm Museum sells Christmas trees. A 5-6&#039; tree would cost you $40. You can also pick up some gifts (focused on local) in the gift shop, as well as their wine &amp; honey.&nbsp; Feed the goats... A little escape from the city, not too far away.<br /><br />More in their farm newsletter:<br />http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?ca=176b4f24-2ef4-4c69-a67a-e30d798aae3f&amp;c=12ab22a0-4645-11e3-917c-d4ae5292c4dd&amp;ch=147f9480-4645-11e3-921e-d4ae5292c4dd

				&nbsp;Merry Christmas and for those of you enjoying a real Christmas tree and want to see it go back to nature,<br />here is info on Mulchfest 2014. Once again it will be held in Jackson Heights at Travers Park. The trees<br />are put into a chipper and you can take a bag of chipped pine back home for personal use. Join in on <br />Jan 11-12, 2014. Last year JHSCRAPS took in a truck load of pine chips which were distributed locally<br />in tree pits and planting projects sponsored by the JHBeautification Group. Now there is local recycling!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">How to &#039;Chip In.&#039;<br />This year, MulchFest will take place on January 11 and 12, 2014. It’s easier than ever to chip in! There <br />are two ways you can help.<br /><br />Chipping Locations<br />You can bring your tree to a chipping location on January 11 and 12 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. We’ll <br />chip your tree, and give you your very own bag of mulch!<br /><br />Drop Off Locations<br />Or you can bring your tree to a drop-off site from Saturday, January 4 through Sunday, January 12. Leave<br />your tree with us, and we’ll recycle it for you later! The NYC Department of Sanitation will also be conducting<br />special curbside collections&nbsp; for mulching and recycling of Christmas trees from Monday, December 30, 2013 <br />through Wednesday, January 15, 2014.<br /><br />What to Bring<br />Please remember to remove all lights and ornaments before bringing the tree to a MulchFest site. Biodegradable <br />bags will be provided if you wish to take some free mulch home. Mulch is available at the sites marked with <br />an asterisk (*) below.<br /><br />Want to volunteer at MulchFest ? Register to join the GreenTeam and MillionTreesNYC volunteer group.<br /></span>
