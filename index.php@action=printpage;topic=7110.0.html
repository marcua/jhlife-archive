				Am not sure what the chronology of green groups is here in Jackson Heights. The group that I have long seen doing the most is JHBG- the beautification<br />group. And the Green Agenda, which I think grew out of or is annexed to Friends of Travers Park. What is Green Alliance and are they in co-operation or<br />in opposition to these others groups? And why would we need so many green groups here in the first place? It seems like a consolidation would make<br />more sense to reach more folks which is usually a problem here in JH. I saw a posting that Green Alliance is now seemingly running the Travers Park <br />redo. I am wondering if there is some undercurrent of discontent that should be disclosed or does this all make sense somehow?

				A quick explanation of JH&#039;s green groups.<br /><br />Friends of Travers Park is a committee of Jackson Heights Beautification Group, as is the Green Agenda for Jackson Heights. Under earlier leadership it did tremendous work to rescue the park from being a horrible mess in the late &#039;80s and early &#039;90s and worked with the city to create a number of green planting areas in the park during a major mid-1990s renovation. After I came to head Friends we did many additional plantings and fenced in the planting areas to improve the survival of plants.<br /><br />We brought the Green Market to the park in 2000 and in 2004 started Summer Sundays in the Park, our annual multi-cultural performance series. Depending on volunteers we have run story time in the park programs. Around this time started working with what was originally Jackson Heights Green to try to get more park space - first focusing on Queensboro Toyota, then the 78th Street Playstreet and the finally the Garden School playground.<br /><br />To help focus attention on the need for more park space and to address other local environmental issues, JHBG/Friends of Travers Park and Queens Community House collaborated on the Green Agenda for JH study that attracted more than 400 people to more than 15 meetings. Members of the Jackson Heights Green, which soon became the Jackson Heights Green Alliance participated in this effort.<br /><br />Since the GA4JH report came out in June 2010 we have been working primarily on the 1. green space issues - getting more park space and various tree-care and tree-planting efforts - and 2. green solutions for trash - we just received a permit from the state to operate a community composting center under the BQE near 35th Avenue.<br /><br />There is still a need for a robust Friends of Travers Park working actively there &nbsp;and on future nearby open spaces. We are in the process of putting together a team to do this, but clearly need more help if this is going to work. Please contact me at LenManiace@gmail.com if you are interested in this.<br /><br />While you might wonder if it&#039;s more efficient for everyone to work under one organization, we&#039;re all volunteers and volunteers should be able to work the way they chose as long as they are improving the neighborhood.<br /><br />Thanks for raising the issue, Taggie. Sometimes we don&#039;t always explain who we are and what we do. We probably should do more of this.<br /><br />And while we&#039;re talking about important JH groups, I need to get in a plug for the St. Joan of Arc Youth Council, probably the most important youth recreation program in JH. It serves many hundred kids with very affordable sports, art and chess programs and is open to people regardless of religion or school attended. <br /><br />-Len Maniace, vice president JHBG<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				Thanks for clarifying though I am still not exactly sure if the Green Agenda and the Green Alliance are one and the same? One group is holding some event<br />about the park space soon.

				The Green Agenda for Jackson Heights, which is part of JHBG, is different from Jackson Heights Green Alliance, which is hosting a meeting on the playstreet/pedestrian plaza. <br /><br />Not to make things more confusing, but GA4JH/JHBG is also participating at that March event at the Jewish Center.
