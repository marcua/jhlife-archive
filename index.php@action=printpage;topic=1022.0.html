				Does anyone remember a pet store on 37th Ave across the street from Trade Fare?&nbsp; When I moved in here in 1996, this store sold puppies and had them in the window playing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not sure what store is in its place now.

				Here&#039;s a place I&#039;ve shopped at that also maintains a nice variety of healthy pet foods and assorted pet products.&nbsp; Their website only seems to list a few of the brands they offer, but the walk-in store carries more variety.&nbsp; We use Canidae products, and this is one of the few places that does carry it.&nbsp; What&#039;s nice is that they also give you free samples with your purchase.&nbsp; It&#039;s right off Roosevelt Avenue, on 52nd Street -- across from La Flor.<br /><br />http://tpshnyc.com/index.php

				Thanks, I did try Rainbow and they mostly do dogs.&nbsp; (Thanks, btw, to you and others who posted on the pet supplies thread).&nbsp; It&#039;s a long shot, but I was hoping to find someone local who specializes in cats because, well, they can be resistant.&nbsp;

				Buddy, the store is located on the side street.&nbsp; I have to admit that it&#039;s been about 3 months since the last time I was there, so I hope they haven&#039;t called it quits.&nbsp; Like I said in my previous post, they carry a large selection of pet products, offer grooming services and have a very friendly and knowledgeable staff.&nbsp; Unfortunately, given the fact that they are located in Woodside, it obviously has curtailed my visits.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been purchasing online and will probably continue to do so until I&#039;m comfortable with a JH shop.

				One more long shot.&nbsp; I went into the Puppies R Us on 86th St just North of Northern Blvd.&nbsp; It&#039;s a small pet store (but they sell Wellness).&nbsp; It seems the place is mostly grooming animals. The gal there seems busy with animals every time I&#039;ve gone in.&nbsp; So I asked her about grooming cats.<br /><br />She said she bathes them, cleans their ears and trims their nails but she does not cut their fur.&nbsp; Now I&#039;ve never taken my dog to her just because, so far, I&#039;m happy at Rainbow.&nbsp; But you could always go talk to her and see what you think.&nbsp; I wish I could speak from personal experience but sometimes even that&#039;s different for everyone.&nbsp; Good luck.

				Thanks for scoping that out Buddy.&nbsp; I really appreciate it!&nbsp; I recently took in a Persian and cutting out some mats is my main concern, but ideally I&#039;d also like to find some instruction so I can groom him myself in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m finding a few &quot;well, maybe&quot; situations, and those who are willing to do it if the cat is tranquilized.&nbsp; I will keep making calls because I&#039;m holding out hope that eventually I will find someone good.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried Astoria yet.&nbsp; Worst case scenario I can prevail upon my vet to help (even they can&#039;t recommend an appropriate groomer, they are so scarce!) and in the meantime I&#039;m gingerly trying to chip away at the mats myself.<br /><br />Are you finding the Wellness cheaper than at Coral on Roosevelt?<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t gone to Coral because I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s &quot;scuzzy&quot;.&nbsp; I buy the large cans at 86th Street. They charge $1.79.&nbsp; Rainbow, if I remember, charges about $1.95.&nbsp; So that&#039;s that.&nbsp; Re: your persian. if she lets you pet her, have a scissor in one hand and as you slowly stroke her, gently cut out the mats.&nbsp; It may not be the prettiest hair cut but you may be able to make her coat better.&nbsp; If I weren&#039;t so darn allergic to cats, I&#039;d try.&nbsp; I&#039;m a hair stylist and I groom my dog between visits to Rainbow because it&#039;s fun to do.&nbsp; Good luck.

				A year after the massive pet food recall, there remain many unanswered questions on what has been done to safeguard our pets from tainted food supplies.&nbsp; According to a report on the pet food safety issue, recent legislation aimed at addressing the problem may not be enough, as this legislation relies heavily on voluntary recalls from manufacturers.<br /><br />More info here:<br /><br />http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23505218/<br /><br />There&#039;s a link to an accompanying video under the kitty&#039;s picture.

				The FDA has completely halted all suspect ingredients coming in from China, a move almost unprecedented from the FDA.<br /><br />The items on their list of currently halted shipments include: <br />Amino Acids<br />Corn Gluten<br />Corn Gluten Meal<br />Corn By-Products<br />Mung Bean Gluten <br />Mung Bean Protein <br />Protein Hydrosylates<br />Rice Gluten<br />Rice Protein<br />Rice Protein Concentrate<br />Rice Milled Products <br />Soy Bean Meal<br />Soy Bean Powder<br />Soy Bean Gluten<br />Soy Bean Protein Isolate <br />Soy Protein<br />Soy Protein Powder<br />Soy Gluten <br />Wheat Gluten <br />Wheat Flour Gluten<br />Wheat Protein <br /><br />Please check your pet food labels for any of the above ingredients. If it contains ANY of them, just throw it out and look for another brand. If you need to, take this list with you to the grocery or pet storeâ€”or better yetâ€”shop leisurely online where you can read ingredients (without a magnifying glass) and ask the manufacturer your questions about unlisted ingredients and place of manufacture.<br /><br />I was very lucky during last year&#039;s pet food crisis. I had never used any of the recalled&nbsp; tainted foods. Please remember that most grocery and pet store brands are not the most nutritious or the healthiest for your pet. <br /><br />I learned about this family-owned and packaged brand from a Weimaraner breeder at the 1993 Westminster. My children, dogs and cars always got the best stuff I could afford. Now, I drive my car into the ground; my children are all grown and able to take care of themselves . . . so my dogs are the sole beneficiary of my generosity! <br /><br />I cook healthy, meat-based foods for my dogs, but I also use <strong><span class="bbc_u">Evanger&#039;s Dog and Cat Food Company</span></strong> (http://www.evangersdogfood.com/about/press.html) canned and dry dog foods. The company takes advantage of its small size by processing its own pet food and controlling the quality of its products. They use no grains or fillers in their pet food.

I am boycotting all brands that were involved in the recall. They ALL waited too long and NONE of them have accepted the full responsibility that their quality control left a good deal to be desired. Shame on all of them. We are never going to know the exact figures of how many pets were killed by the pet food manufacturers&#039; incompetence. I know that the dog show world was decimated by so many deaths. Some breeding programs have been halted because prized bitches and otherwise very healthy studs were killed by what we all thought of as good sources of nutritious dog food. <br /><br />I will grant y&#039;all that I am totally neurotic about the health of my dogs. So what if I brush their teeth every day? I also give them USDA dehydrated/freeze dried chicken breast, pigs&#039; ears and bull pizzles to chew on which also helps them keep their teeth tartar-free. It&#039;s certainly less expensive than getting their teeth done under anesthesia by a vet once a year! I also never feed them the same food 2 days in a row. From when they are puppies, I get them used to different things so that they don&#039;t have to deal with upset tummies, vomiting and loose stools. <br /><br />When I cook for them, this is what I make.<br /><br /><strong>HOMEMADE DOG FOOD</strong><br /><em>Grocery List:</em><br />4 Chicken Thighs (with skin on)<br />2â€“4 Boned Chicken Breasts (with skin on)<br />25â€“30 Baby Carrots<br />1/2 cup Enriched Pastina or Brown Rice<br />Filtered Water<br />Apple Cider Vinegar<br />1 tsp (per serving) Calcium Powder (optional)<br />1 tsp (per serving) Omega-3 Fatty Acid Powder (optional)<br />Low-Fat Vanilla-Flavored Yogurt<br />Part Skim Ricotta Cheese<br />Sardines in Olive Oil<br /><br /><em>To Prepare:</em><br />In a large saucepan add the chicken thighs, chicken breasts, sliced baby carrots, pastina or rice, water to cover and 1 capful apple cider vinegar. Cook covered on low flame until chicken falls off bone easily. Allow to cool slightly, drain any excess liquid and remove thigh bones. Shred all chicken pieces into chunks and stir mixture to evenly distribute. You may double and triple this recipeâ€”it freezes very well either in bulk or in individual portions.<br /><br /><em>To Serve:</em><br />Take out what you will need to mix the foodâ€”some of each of the ingredientsâ€”add 1 tsp calcium powder, 1 tsp omega-3 fatty acid powder and enough of either yogurt or ricotta to blend all together, and mix. Heat in microwave for 1 minute (or until you have removed the chill, but do not make it hot) mix with a handful of dry dog food. If the dog finishes it right away make a little more. If it sits for more than 2 hours, throw it away.<br /><br />You can also mix the dry food with yogurt or ricotta for a meal; you can also give a chopped hard-boiled egg with either the yogurt or ricotta mixed into the dry food; you can mix 1 sardine with the hard boiled egg and some dry dog food for a meal; actually, you can mix any combination of any of the above for a healthy, nutritious meal. I also liberally serve non-spicy table scraps with any of the above, especially the salads and the vegetables. When I take home a doggy bag, it really is for the doggies!

				This article is a MUST read for all dog owners:<br />http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2008/04/pet_food_recalls93.html<br /><br />Do you remember their response from last summer?<br />http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/08/pet_food_recalls69.html<br /><br />They also manufacture MAX, Natural Choice, and Ultra besides their flagship brand, Nutro.<br /><br />Please, G-d, when will this stuff stop?

				In light of Wal-Mart&#039;s recent decision to aggressively pursue and expand its pet products market, including its home brand dog food Ol&#039; Roy :buck2:, I thought I&#039;d post a link to Natura Pet&#039;s website that offers a helpful pet food comparison tool.&nbsp; Alarmingly, the Wal-Mart article states that Ol&#039; Roy is the #1 dog food in the nation!&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br /><strong>The Wal-Mart article:</strong><br /><br />http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/13/news/companies/walmart_petsrecession/?postversion=2008051314<br /><br /><strong>Natura Pets Comparison Tool:</strong><br /><br />http://www.naturapet.com/tools/comparison.asp

				$20+ for travel or tote bags is a great price.&nbsp; I already have everything but it&#039;s still tempting.&nbsp; I just hate going into the City for anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s too bad the sale didn&#039;t start Sunday since I was on 14th St. any way.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; How many outfits does one dog need?!?

				Buddy, I thought you had posted about Super Doggy Wonder Kitty, but I didn&#039;t find it on a search.&nbsp; This shop carries most better brands of pet foods, is well stocked, clean and nicely organized.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember the hours, but I went on a Sunday evening at approximately 6:30 and they were still open.&nbsp; Their business card says that they also offer grooming services by appointment.<br /><br />Super Doggy Wonder Kitty<br />43-04 43rd Street<br />Sunnyside<br />Phone:&nbsp; (718) 786-5117

				I&#039;m moving to a new place in Woodside (67th Street &amp; 41st Ave) and am excited that my new place allows small pets.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be adopting a pet rabbit or a pair of rabbits once I settle in.&nbsp; Of course, I will be needing to feed them.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a good pet supply store?&nbsp; I used to go to a place (but this was upstate NY) that sold Nutrena rabbit pellets in bulk (like 35 cents a pound).&nbsp; All I&#039;d really need to get from this store on a regular basis would be pellets and hay.&nbsp; I plan to buy big bags of woodstove pellets for the litterbox at home depot.
