				I use Warby Parker and am pleased. You can have up to 5 sample pairs sent to you or visit one of their stores to try on different styles. <br /><br />I don&#039;t wear bifocals/progressives, so not sure how they do with that.

				I have purchased progressive lenses from Eyebuydirect and was very pleased with the result and the price. Just be careful with whatever add-ons you select, a the price can go up substantially.&nbsp; I think I paid about $80 for progressive trifocals.

				JH Resident:&nbsp; The price at eyebuydirect is extra thin progressive lens $79.95, Tinting $4.95 &amp; Metal Square Frame $9 = $93.90.&nbsp; At FIRMOO extra thin progressive lens $69.95, Tinting $9.95 &amp; Metal Square Frame $19.99 for a total of $99.89.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went to an eyeglass store on 37th Avenue yesterday and received a price for lens only since I have frames.&nbsp; Progressive lens $250.00 plus they recommend tinting for $100.00 for a total of $350.00.&nbsp; However, if I made an immediate purchase and paid half immediately the price would be just $300.00.&nbsp; No thank you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just out of curiosity, I plan to get price quotes from others on 37th Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				that price (local) seems in line with the two i&#039;ve used. Olivos, where the doctors are very accomodating, and the one up near 81st, where i went once many years ago. i think they count on people using vision insurance, so the prices are fairly high.<br /><br />lately, i&#039;ve been using BonLook for glasses, online.

				39DollarGlasses.com will re-lens frames for you, and are based in Long Island.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also used Eyewear Insight, Goggles4U, Firmoo, Zenni, Optical4Less and EyeBuyDirect. Never had a problem with the prescription at any place I&#039;ve ordered from.<br /><br />Look at the return policy. For example, Zenni only gives you 50% back, where EyeBuyDirect gives a complete refund (but you pay shipping).<br /><br />
