				I&#039;m kind of shocked.&nbsp; I always thought that his best chance would be to get a jury--or even just a few jurors--that would look past the obvious holes in his story and find a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Instead, he gets a judge who has said, on the record, that the video of the incident&#039;s aftermath makes the &quot;blood boil&quot; (the judge had such a negative reaction to the video that he refused to release it to the media because he thought it would poison the jury pool). <br /><br />Despite the fact this judge is a former Legal Aid lawyer,he has a terrible reputation with the defense bar when it comes to domestic violence cases.&nbsp; He&#039;s seen as a hanging judge.&nbsp; This is a real roll of the dice on Monserrate&#039;s part.

				I think that Monserrate is afraid of public opinion of his recent wonderful performance in Albany. <br />If he just read some of the posts on this site (and some were mine) then he would be fearful of the public opinion. <br />And I thought he didn&#039;t think we really mattered!&nbsp; :tickedoff:

Hiram Monserrate delivered a slap in the face to his Queens constituents yesterday as he went on trial for allegedly slashing his girlfriend with a jagged piece of glass.<br /><br />Monserrate chose to have a judge decide guilt or innocence, rather than put his fate in the hands of a jury. So much for having faith in the ability of his constituents to mull the evidence fairly. <br /><br />While he was within rights to avoid having his conduct reviewed by peers, it must be noted that the senator successfully objected to the release of key video evidence on the ground that the tape would prejudice potential jurors. <br /><br />According to prosecutors, the tape shows Monserrate manhandling his girlfriend in a stairwell in the hours before the alleged slashing. Monserrate&#039;s judge, who viewed the video, says &quot;it causes the blood to boil.&quot; <br /><br />Bottom line: Monserrate manipulated the proceedings with a claim that he would never be able to get an impartial jury if the tape came out, and then fled from standing before the citizenry when forced to trial. <br /><br />Par for the course with this guy.<br /><br />

				The judge is reputedly very tough on domestic violence cases and has already said that the video he has seen &quot;makes the blood boil&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;m not quite sure what Monseratte&#039;s strategy is in this whole situation, any one care to hazard a guess ?

				Title: <strong>Womenâ€™s Group Presses Judge in Monserrate Trial</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>francis</strong> on <strong>September 19, 2009, 06:58:36 PM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/monserrate-judge/<br />The National Organization for Women in New York State is calling on the judge trying State Senator Hiram Monserrate on domestic violence charges to give him â€œthe maximum sentence allowable by law.â€<br /><br />But Mr. Monserrate has not yet gone on trial on charges that he slashed his companionâ€™s face during an argument on Dec. 19 â€” that starts on Monday in State Supreme Court in Queens. And he certainly has not been convicted.<br /><br />To the outrage of his lawyers, the womenâ€™s group is asking its supporters to reach out to the jurist who is hearing the case as judge and jury. Mr. Monserrate decided this week to have his guilt or innocence decided by a judge in a bench trial rather than by a 12-member jury of his peers.<br /><br />â€œCall or write the Honorable William M. Erlbaum,â€ the womenâ€™s organization told supporters in e-mail messages this week. â€œSend a message that violence against women must be stopped and perpetrators must be brought to justice.â€ <br /><br />It included a template for sending a message to Justice Erlbaum that concluded: â€œI implore you to do the right thing by punishing Senator Monserrate, giving him the maximum sentence allowable by law. By doing so, you will be sending a very important message and that is that violence against women is a serious crime.â€<br /><br />Joseph Tacopina, Mr. Monserrateâ€™s lead lawyer, who was alerted to the campaign by one of the senatorâ€™s constituents who had received the appeal, called it â€œinappropriate, improper and offensiveâ€ and said he would offer a legal objection when the case opens on Monday.<br /><br />â€œTheyâ€™re trying to improperly persuade the fact finder,â€ Mr. Tacopina said in an interview. â€œItâ€™s akin to writing a letter to a juror.â€<br /><br />Marcia Pappas, the president of the womenâ€™s organization in New York State, acknowledged the campaign to influence Justice Erlbaum, saying in an interview, â€œWeâ€™re imploring him to do the right thing.â€<br /><br />She said the campaign was nothing unusual for what she called â€œan activist organizationâ€ that has often written to family court judges in child custody cases.<br /><br />â€œIâ€™m sure the judge knows what he needs to do, so his position is not compromised,â€ Ms. Pappas said.<br /><br />Asked for comment, Justice Erlbaum said through a clerk that it would be inappropriate to respond.<br /><br />David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the stateâ€™s Office of Court Administration, called the matter â€œan intriguing question,â€ but he said contacting a judge about a case did not carry the same strictures as contacting a juror. <br /><br />â€œJudges who are conducting bench trials use the same guidance they give juries, which is not to be influenced by any external factors but to consider only the evidence before them,â€ Mr. Bookstaver said. â€œWhile it is improper for anyone to contact a sitting juror, judges are in fact public officials with public addresses. There is no way to prevent members of the public or concerned groups from attempting to contact them.â€<br /><br />In accepting Mr. Monserrateâ€™s application last Monday for a nonjury trial, Justice Erlbaum warned the senator that â€œin a bench trial, I wear two hats: I get to see all the evidence, even impermissible evidence.â€ He said he would seek to separate his legal responsibilities as judge and jury, â€œbut the same corporeal human being has seen and heard all the evidence.â€<br /><br />Mr. Monserrate, 42, was charged with three counts of felony assault and three counts of misdemeanor assault for what prosecutors said was his slicing of the face of his companion, Karla Giraldo, 30, with a broken drinking glass after he found another manâ€™s card in her purse. He has pleaded not guilty, and he and Ms. Giraldo have called the injury, requiring 20 stitches, an accident that happened when Mr. Monserrate tripped as he carried her a glass of water. <br /><br />Scenes of an apparent argument were caught on videotape at Mr. Monserrateâ€™s Jackson Heights apartment. Ms. Giraldo made conflicting statements to hospital workers suggesting in part that the injury was not accidental, prosecutors said. <br /><br />If he finds Mr. Monserrate guilty of felony assault, Justice Erlbaum could sentence him to up to seven years in prison. He could also find him guilty on lesser misdemeanor counts or acquit him.<br /><br />The womenâ€™s organization has previously called on the State Senate to oust Mr. Monserrate, a Democrat whose defection to the Republicans with a fellow Democrat last June handed control briefly to the Republicans and threw Albany into gridlock. <br />

				I think the second part of the video, in the vestibule, is disturbing.&nbsp; She screams, and then tries to hold onto the door frame as he&#039;s pulling her out of the building.&nbsp; When the door closes on her hand, she finally lets go as he drags her out the door.&nbsp; The first part of the video, when she apparently knocks on a neighbor&#039;s door, will have to be considered in conjunction with the neighbor&#039;s testimony.&nbsp; According to the prosecution, the alleged victim was banging on the door and screaming for help.<br /><br />What I find interesting is that Monserrate&#039;s attorney will supposedly argue that what you see on the video is not some abuser dragging his screaming victim away before someone can call the police.&nbsp; No, it&#039;s a concerned lover trying to get his bleeding girlfriend help as quickly as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, if speed was of the essence, then why not go to Elmhurst hospital, which is only a few blocks away.&nbsp; Why not call 911?&nbsp; Instead, just moments after dragging her out the door he suddenly decides he has time to jump on the LIE and drive to the Nassau border to get medical assistance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Common sense leads me to believe that the reason he didn&#039;t go to Elmhurst hospital, or call 911, which would have resulted in the victim being taken to Elmhurst, is because he is well known in the community and didn&#039;t want to be recognized.&nbsp; Moreover, I haven&#039;t seen the first part of the video where the two of them are allegedly arguing in the hallway over something he found in her purse.&nbsp; That would seem to set the stage for a violent escalation of matters later that evening.&nbsp; Or maybe she just fell into the lip of a water glass and did this to herself.

				The relative steadiness of her gait, even though she is being forced to walk in&nbsp; the direction that Hiram chose, belies his lawyer&#039;s explanation that she &quot;so intoxicated&quot; she needed Mr. Monserrate&#039;s support.

Monseratte can not afford to admit that, especially not at this point. Even if it meant keeping his seat in Albany it would be an issue that would dog him in future races, especially ones where he&#039;d have to go beyond the base he&#039;s built in JH, E.Elmhurst, Corona, etc. Though he&#039;s done a good job at shooting him self in the foot without the whole felony assault charges, so it really is any one&#039;s guess as to what&#039;s going through his head.

				I was watching some news coverage this morning, both Hiram Monserrate and Karla Giraldo surround themselves with quite interesting people.<br /><br />As a resident of Jackson Heights, I know them all by face and reputation.<br /><br />Firstly, Hiram is being supported by Ramon Baez, who for many years published a newspaper that was negative to all candidates that were not Hiram Monserrate, much like Resumen, which is run by Karla Giraldo&#039;s relatives.<br /><br />The bigger issue I find is Karla Giraldo, walk hand in hand with Miriam Mercedez Hernandez.<br /><br />If no one has ever heard of her, she is currently facing charges from Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&#039;s office for scamming immigrants, by taking money to file INS forms, and pocketing the money.<br /><br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/05/13/2009-05-13_queens_businesswoman_.html (http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/05/13/2009-05-13_queens_businesswoman_.html)<br /><br /><br />No big surprise, that shady people, follow other shady people.<br /><br />Also, very interesting to see that Mr. Monserrate&#039;s lawyer is trying to claim that the ER doctor did not understand Ms. Giraldo, yet the doctor is bilingual and of hispanic heritage.<br /><br />First, he claims that Ms. Giraldo was drunk, now he claims she is incoherant, what line of b/s is next?

				I have two questions for those who might be more knowledgeable about our state&#039;s election laws:<br /><br />1. If Monseratte should somehow come through this trial without being convicted of a felony and retain his state senate seat, can we as the electorate do anything to remove him from office before his term expires, such as circulating a petition asking for a recall election?<br /><br />2. If Monseratte is convicted and loses his state senate seat, how will his replacement be selected? Will a special election need to be held or will someone have the power to appoint his replacement in the interim?

				I was recently discussing this issue with a friend, and he brought up the subject of reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Do you think it exists in this case?<br /><br />The last I read on the case involved a doctor&#039;s testimony stating that Ms. Giraldo kept changing her story in the emergency room.&nbsp; I also read that she kept screaming something like, &quot;I can&#039;t believe he cut my face&quot;, or something along those lines.&nbsp; In my opinion, this doesn&#039;t help his case.

He was pulling me for my own good, and thanks to him Iâ€™m all right and my face is all right.â€<br /><br />The prosecution, which had been under pressure to call Ms. Giraldo as the supposed victim, carefully avoided asking her just how her face came to be cut, at the risk of giving her answer legal credibility. Lawyers may not present a witness whose testimony they believe to be false. <br /><br />â€œItâ€™s not the prosecution position,â€ an assistant district attorney, Scott Kessler, said of her assertions of an accident. â€œNor did I believe Iâ€™d be offering truthful testimony to the court,â€ he told Justice William M. Erlbaum, who is hearing the case without a jury in State Supreme Court in Queens. <br /><br />In a dramatic day replete with unusual twists, Ms. Giraldo, 30, broke down once, when asked to view the video showing her holding a towel to her bleeding face as she and Mr. Monserrate rushed out of his Jackson Heights apartment after the prosecution says he slashed her face with a broken glass in a jealous rage.<br /><br />Putting a hand to her face, she began to sob. â€œI canâ€™t go on,â€ she blurted and was allowed out to compose herself. <br /><br />Click link above for rest of article.

				a letter to the editor in today&#039;s daily news asks an interesting question. i am repeating it here -- and wonder what folks here might say?<br /><br />Glass alibi<br /><br />Jackson Heights: I was wondering why, if state Sen. Hiram Monserrate did slip and accidentally smash a glass against his girlfriend&#039;s face, why did he not have any cuts on his hand. I would think that if the glass broke in his hand as it hit his girlfriend&#039;s face with such force that she needed 30 or 40 stitches, he, too, would have suffered some cuts from the broken glass.<br /><br />Emily Butler<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/letters/index.html#ixzz0Sn2WDaMh<br />

				I thought that there was testimony that Monserrate did have some small cuts on his fingers.&nbsp; Of course, I&#039;m not sure what that proves.&nbsp; The prosecution claims that he broke the glass with his hand and slashed the victim.&nbsp; The defense claims that he broke the glass by accident.&nbsp; Either way, he could very well have cuts on his fingers.

				From the Times:<br /><br />The two counts were dismissed by Justice William M. Erlbaum in State Supreme Court in Queens after arguments by a defense lawyer, Chad Siegel.

				This is far from a &quot;bombshell&quot; as the Queens Courier reported.&nbsp; In fact, it&#039;s quite routine.&nbsp; Judges often dismiss charges before the case goes to the trier of fact, usually a jury,but in this case the judge.&nbsp; Plus, as the Times indicates, under New York law you cannot be convicted of committing the same act recklessly <em>and</em> intentionally.&nbsp; It&#039;s either one or the other.&nbsp; Nothing in this case indicated that this was a reckless act on Monserrate&#039;s part.&nbsp; It&#039;s always been about whether he intentionally cut her with the glass or whether it was an accident as he claims.&nbsp; This is really no big deal.

				from <strong>The New York Times </strong> :<br /><br />State Senator Hiram Monserrate, a freshman Democrat and former police officer and city councilman, was found guilty on Thursday of misdemeanor assault, but escaped a felony conviction for slicing his companionâ€™s face during a bitter argument in his Queens apartment on Dec. 19.<br /><br />Justice William M. Erlbaum, who tried the case without a jury in State Supreme Court in Queens, found Mr. Monserrate guilty of recklessly causing physical injury to his companion, Karla Giraldo, by dragging her though his lobby after she was cut. <br /><br />The judge found him not guilty of two felony counts of causing her serious injury, one citing the glass as â€œa dangerous weapon.â€ He also acquitted Mr. Monserrate of a misdemeanor charge of intending to cause physical injury to Ms. Giraldo by cutting her with a drinking glass. <br /><br /><em>note - a misdemeanor would not force Monserrate out of the Senate</em><br /><br />

				Frankly, I&#039;m not surprised by the outcome here. Justice Erlbaum clearly followed a kind of plausible (if offensive) reading of the law and the facts (as presented) in the case. I think another outcome might have been had if the judge had been from another jurisdiction, since I think that this is also a political decision rendered by a judge who, by all accounts, sees himself as part of the community. That we&#039;re stuck with a dead baby (a disgraced, impotent, State Senator) is some measure of the price we pay for this very political decision. If he is not guilty of attacking his girlfriend with a broken glass, but only of dragging her down the stairs and out the door of his building, then I&#039;m sure he will be increasing his support for victims of domestic abuse and for programs to educate young men on how to handle their emotions. &quot;Happens all the time&quot; my students say of domestic abuse. &nbsp;&quot;Happens all the time?&quot; We cannot allow this to seem normal or natural.<br /><br />I wish Karla Giraldo could be prosecuted for perjuring herself on the stand. I hope she never has to experience such a brutal assault again, and I also hope that no young women saw what she did as a possible path for themselves. &nbsp;I know that as an educator in the public university system, I vow to make this topic a central concern of my practice for the duration of my career. In the meantime, I&#039;ll be out on the streets urging for an alternative to Hiram Monserrate for State Senate. <br /><br />

				The question is, perhaps, not so much who will run against him, but who will continue to back him now that he&#039;s been spared automatic ejection via felony? I for one will be keeping a scorecard of Queens County Democrats who a) line up behind him, or b) remain silent.&nbsp; Hopefully, none of our other elected officials will be hiding in the bushes until the anger subsides.&nbsp; I know the Albany folks need him--but we don&#039;t have to play along with that.

				Yes, seems like the democrats need to find a way to get rid of him and replace him with a democrat otherwise the Republicans will with a Republican.<br /><br />Jackson Heights does not need a Senator who rips off the police department for disability, steals from charities and &quot;misdemeanor&quot; assaults his girlfriend. Enough is enough.&nbsp; I hope that the people who supported him in the past now finally realize that he is only out for himself.&nbsp; <br /><br />If he had any class at all he would step down so we can have a real Senator work for our neighborhood.&nbsp; However, I would be shocked if he did such a thing.&nbsp;

Domestic violence is a scourge on our society, and an issue which I believe requires us to speak out.&nbsp; Only through speaking out can we work to prevent more violence, support survivors, end the stigma and fear that victims deal with, and advocate for stronger penalties for those who believe they are above the law and violate another human being.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Senate is exploring our institutional legal options now that the Courts have ruled, but haven&#039;t yet issued a sentence. For me, the length of the sentence does not matter - domestic violence is domestic violence, guilt is guilt.&nbsp; Therefore, I believe Hiram Monserrate should not remain in the Senate.&quot;<br />

				It&#039;s a step up for him, larger district, greater reach in to the community to expand what he has done as an assemblyman and if he has higher aspirations it&#039;s a good place to be, despite the dysfunctional senate. Besides, the assembly ain&#039;t that much better. I&#039;d also rather have a Senator with experience in the state capital, and someone who has proven to be a good elected official in that seat than not.

				It&#039;s being said by legal experts that Monserrate is unlikely to serve time in jail for a first offense.&nbsp; If he doesn&#039;t get expelled from the senate, every time he shows his smug, chubby cheeks in the neighborhood for some publicity event, I think we should all picket.

				What a long, strange, and very unfortunate tale.&nbsp; Here are some details of Mr. Monserrate&#039;s career prior to the Democratic Organization of Queens County anointing him State Senator:<br /><br />- As part of a Latino officers organization, successfully sued the city for discrimination and won a large cash settlement.<br />- Retired from the police department due to mental health issues.<br />- Enters public political life and reputedly engages in very rough fund raising and election tactics.&nbsp; <br />- On primary eve 2001, has an altercation with a tow truck driver who is attempting to repossess&nbsp; his car.&nbsp; He hits the driver with his car.&nbsp; This is lost in the tragedy of 9-11.<br />-&nbsp; Ponders running for Congress against incumbent congressman and leader of Queens County Democrats, Joe Crowley.<br />-&nbsp; Is an instrumental player with the non profit organization LIBRE.&nbsp; $400,000 of city grant money subsequently can&#039;t be accounted for.<br />- In what proves to be very foretelling, Monserrate attends a fundraiser for Republican State Senator Joe Bruno.<br /><br />Which brings us to the State Senate primary election in the summer of 2008.&nbsp; Make no mistake about this:&nbsp; The elected political establishment was very, very aware of Mr. Monserrate&#039;s dubious record.&nbsp; Not one of the District Leaders actually cares for Mr. Monserrate.&nbsp; They know full well what he is all about.&nbsp; Their political calculus was based on fear.&nbsp; From Crowley down to every district leader. <br /><br />So in what will likely go down as one of the grandest blunders in local political history, party leaders decide attempt to placate Mr. Monserrate by clearing the road for him to become a state senator.&nbsp; <br /><br />And so the district leaders set about savaging John Sabini.&nbsp; And voila, we have Senator Monserrate.&nbsp; So what has happened since becoming Senator?<br /><br />- Mr. Monserrate is in Albany for about fifteen minutes before he starts up with the Gang-of-Four business.<br />- The sordid and awful domestic violence event.<br />- And of course, the great Senate coup of 2009.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now that Mr. Monserrate has seemingly imploded enough not to be a threat, Rep. Crowley green lights the coup-de-grace with the following statement:<br /><br />â€œMr. Monserrate&#039;s conviction for recklessly injuring his girlfriend leaves too many questions about his judgment and ability to lead,â€ Crowley said in a statement. â€œHis violent behavior was not befitting a public official, and Queens residents deserve the opportunity to elect a new representative. He should close this troubling chapter by immediately resigning his office.â€<br /><br />As the saying goes, &quot;Politics, it ain&#039;t bean bag.&quot;

				Sadly, I agree Mr. Monserrate isn&#039;t going anywhere soon.&nbsp; He is going to go, but it is going to take a little time to play out.<br /><br />He is not the kind of guy to bow to pressure.&nbsp; And from his perspective, why should he go?&nbsp; There are few careers that can quench a politician&#039;s thirst for power like public office.&nbsp; If he quits, what is he going to do, be a has been lobbyist? I think he will try to ride it out.<br /><br />There is also a big Albany component here.&nbsp; Democrats need all hands on deck to control the senate.&nbsp; Politically, Democrats have to pick their poison.&nbsp; Live with Monserrate through the next election cycle (when he presumably gets defeated) or somehow expel/force-out Monserrate and deal with a dead locked senate until the seat can be filled.&nbsp; It is a problem.<br /><br />As for who will run against Mr. Monserrate, I would wager that has been settled upon.&nbsp; County leader Crowley would never call for someone to step aside without knowing who they were going to put forward for the vacancy.&nbsp; Now, county&#039;s preference may or may not work out, but rest assured they have an idea how they want this to go.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				There are two different questions here.<br /><br />1) Will Monseratte survive and not have to step down from his senate seat ?<br /><br />2) If, Monserate does not step down, and decides to run for re-election will he win ?<br /><br />My opinion:<br /><br />1) Sadly, at the moment I think there&#039;s a 50/50 chance that Monserate will lose his seat. If there is no provision in the law that governs such things for him to be removed because of his conduct then he&#039;ll have to step down voluntarily, which he most certainly will not do.&nbsp; If the public outcry is loud enough he may just step down, but so far and in my humble opinion I have yet to see a serious response beyond what one would expect (elcteds issuing statements, constituents signing petitions etc.) He would have to be dogged day an night by very loud very visible protests and be bullied in to stepping down. <br /><br />2) I sure hope not, and I do believe if a viable challenger runs against him he could be voted out o office, it may be by a slim margin as he does have a strong base that apparently isn&#039;t bothered by domestic abuse and political antics.

				Two items on the ongoing Monserrate drama: Today&#039;s Daily News and a blog.&nbsp; Interesting read<br />#1<br />Albany pols should not be the ones to judge Hiram Monserrate<br />ERROL LOUIS <br />Thursday, November 12th 2009, 4:00 AM<br /><br />Don&#039;t be fooled by the moral posturing going on in Albany, where a &quot;special committee of inquiry&quot; of senators has begun investigating the domestic violence case of their colleague, Sen. Hiram Monserrate.<br />The panel is nothing more than a political kangaroo court, one that typifies the arrogance and conflicts of interest that are standard operating procedure in the state capital.<br />Don&#039;t get me wrong: Like most people, I get queasy thinking about Monserrate&#039;s slashing of his girlfriend last December (accidentally, both parties swear) and his manhandling of her to get her to the hospital. I&#039;d be perfectly happy if he resigned from office.<br />I also suspect that Monserrate got a lucky break when a Queens court found him not guilty of felony assault. If found guilty of the felony, Monserrate would have been immediately removed from the Senate.<br />But that&#039;s not what happened. &quot;Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is lacking,&quot; concluded Justice William Erlbaum.<br />Monserrate was convicted of misdemeanor assault and could spend up to a year in jail when he&#039;s sentenced next month. That should be the last word on the case, one that would give Queens voters something to think about when Monserrate stands for reelection in 2010.<br />Unfortunately, the Senate leadership is not content to let the court system and elections function as designed. Instead, they have cobbled together an inquiry process, which could lead to a vote to censure Monserrate or remove him from the Senate.<br />Every pol involved in this farce should be ashamed of themselves, particularly the senators who are lawyers. <br />Start with the fact that the whole ugly incident took place before Monserrate was sworn in as a state senator, raising the question of why the Senate has any jurisdiction over the matter at all.<br />Instead of activating the mostly dormant Senate Ethics Committee, or the Legislative Ethics Commission, the Senate concocted a new panel, one with no set rules of what evidence can be admitted and what procedures will be followed.<br />Unlike a court of law, there will be no neutral judge supervising the proceedings to make sure all constitutional rights are protected.<br />Instead, the Senate has hired attorney Dan Alonso to serve as special counsel to the committee. That creates a conflict for Alonso, who doubles as a member of the state&#039;s Commission on Public Integrity.<br />As a member of the integrity commission, Alonso oversees ethics rules surrounding lobbyists and campaign donors. Questions have been raised about Monserrate&#039;s legal defense fund, which may include money given by lobbyists and campaign donors.<br />So the man instructing the Senate&#039;s quasi-prosecution of Monserrate could very well end up investigating Monserrate&#039;s financial backers.<br />Several of the senators sitting in judgment over Monserrate have conflicts as well. One member of the committee, Sen. Toby Ann Stavisky, is the mother (and client) of Evan Stavisky, whose Parkside Group political consulting firm is working for Assemblyman JosÃ© Peralta, the pol running against Monserrate.<br />Another senator, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, has told the press that calls for Monserrate to resign were &quot;appropriate,&quot; suggesting she&#039;s already made up her mind.<br />&quot;It&#039;s breathtakingly stupid for these members to get involved in this kind of conflict of interest,&quot; says David Grandeau, a consultant who spent 13 years as top ethics watchdog as chairman of the Temporary Commission on Lobbying. <br />&quot;This is all about perception; it&#039;s all about what they want it to look like,&quot; says Grandeau. &quot;Anyone who thinks there&#039;s a watchdog looking out for ethics in New York should wake up. There&#039;s no one there.&quot;<br />Even worse than the shaky legal and ethics basis of the Monserrate committee is the precedent that would be set if pols start removing colleagues - in effect, canceling the will of the voters - simply because they don&#039;t like a particular person.<br />The ill-advised Senate committee should hold only one meeting, for the purpose of disbanding. Leave this matter to the court that tried Monserrate and to the voters who sent him to the state Senate.<br />#2<br />http://momandpopnyc.blogspot.com/2009/11/judge-not.html

As everyone is well aware, Jackson Heights has the largest gay population outside of Greenwich village.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that he no longer has constituents here, only people who want him out of public office asap.

				True indeed, but his district extends beyond Jackson Heights to Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, and parts of Corona. Monserrate is attempting to appeal to the more conservative congregations and churchgoers out side of JH. He&#039;s ceded JH to Peralta. His vote against marriage equality may go carry him further with the more religious voters.

The committee expects to complete its work by the end of the year. <br /><br />But a growing number of lawmakers say they have already made up their minds, and plan to move forward early next year with a vote to expel Monserrate regardless of the committeeâ€™s findings. <br /><br />Sen. Brian Foley of Suffolk, one of the first members of the chamber to call for Monserrateâ€™s removal, has already told colleagues he plans to initiate expulsion proceedings even if the committee recommends a less severe sanction, Foleyâ€™s office confirmed. Senate officials say they expect such a measure to have broad support among both Republicans and Democrats in the chamber. <br /><br />â€œSenator Foley will come out and renew his call for Senator Monserrateâ€™s expulsion even if a panel recommends otherwise,â€ said Ibrahim Kahn, a spokesman for Foley. â€œHe doesnâ€™t foresee how an objective panel can come out with any recommendation other than expulsion.â€ <br /><br />Another prominent Senate Democrat with knowledge of the committeeâ€™s work, who did not want to jeopardize the legality of the review process, put it more bluntly: â€œItâ€™s a done deal.â€ <br /><br />Foley and his allies have been unusually assertive in their campaign to oust Monserrate, hoping to sideline the dissident Democratsâ€”known as the â€œAmigosâ€â€”who have stood by the embattled Queens senator and diminish their bargaining power. In the days following Monserrateâ€™s conviction, Foley called publicly for Monserrateâ€™s removal despite private attempts by the Democratic conference leader, John Sampson, to quiet the uprising. <br /><br />Foley has won support for his effort from some of the chamberâ€™s most prominent members, including Sen. Liz Krueger of Manhattan, who said in an interview that she has seen enough evidence to vote for expulsion as soon as possible. <br /><br />â€œI personally believe that from what I know of the caseâ€”but most important, the review and findings of the committee and evidence that they will give usâ€”there will be grounds to vote for expulsion,â€ she said. â€œAnd pending evidence other than what I know so far, I believe that I will be able to vote for expulsion.â€ <br /><br />Krueger added that if the committee does not recommend expelling Monserrate, Foley and others could seek to remove him from the Senate through other means. <br /><br />â€œBrian Foley could come up with other models that met the constitutional standard and ultimately came to a recommendation of a vote on the floor of the senate,â€ she said. â€œBrian is saying, if the committee process that weâ€™ve already undertaken does not lead to a vote for expulsion, he wants to go forward with other options.â€ <br /><br />Monserrateâ€™s supporters liken the plan to â€œdouble jeopardy,â€ and warn that pre-empting the review process authorized by Senate leaders earlier this year could prompt a protracted legal battle. <br /><br />â€œItâ€™s a little disconcerting that there are certain senators out there that would be inclined to expel him without hearing what recommendations, factually and legally, are to be made by the Senate panel,â€ said Chad Siegel, one of Monserrateâ€™s lawyers. â€œSenator Monserrate has no desire to just roll over and accept the finding that he should be expelled.â€ <br /><br />Siegel added: â€œItâ€™s something that we would contest.â€ <br /><br />Monserrate, who initially said he would cooperate fully with the Senateâ€™s investigation, has not participated in the committeeâ€™s fact-finding process. Lawyers for the Senate panel have sought his testimony, but he and his counselâ€”as well as his girlfriend, Karla Giraldoâ€”have declined. <br /><br />Meanwhile, he and his supporters have begun to move politically against Monserrateâ€™s declared primary challenger, Assemblyman Jose Peralta. Peraltaâ€™s supporters accuse Monserrate of planting a story in the Daily News earlier this month that accused Peralta of steering hundreds of thousands of dollars in earmarks toward a non-profit that does not exist. â€œThis has Monserrateâ€™s fingerprints all over it,â€ one Peralta supporter said. <br /><br />Otherwise, Monserrateâ€™s camp has remained uncharacteristically quiet through the Senateâ€™s review process, negotiating privately behind closed doors to secure the senatorâ€™s fate while anticipating several more months of legal wrangling. <br /><br />When asked if he would oppose efforts by his colleagues to expel Monserrate regardless of the committeeâ€™s recommendations, Sen. Ruben Diaz, Sr., an outspoken ally of Monserrate, said simply, â€œI wish them good luck.â€

				I wish he would just quit. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars this is going to take of our money just to get rid of him. too bad after he is expelled, he will probably have a lawsuit against the state ensuring that he will never have to wrory about money again. this whole thing is a mistake. I wish he was still a crooked cop.

Hiram Monserrate is unfit to serve in Albany and that he should be expelled or censured. <br /><br />The video of Monserrate dragging his bleeding girlfriend out of his apartment building was disturbing, but senators who probed his misdemeanor assault conviction said his actions convinced them he is unfit to be a lawmaker. <br /><br />&quot;His conduct during and after has brought significant shame to the New York State Senate,&quot; said Sen. Diane Savino, D-Staten Island. <br /><br />One bombshell charge is that hours after girlfriend Carla Giraldo was hospitalized with deep facial cuts from a broken glass, Sen. <strong>Monserrate&#039;s staffers tried to get her to change her story to let him off the hook</strong>. <br /><br /><strong>&quot;They sought her out and they got her to write and affidavit and they submitted that to the district attorney,&quot; Savino said. &quot;Within hours she changed her story.&quot; </strong> <br />Lawmakers asked the entire Senate to vote a &quot;severe sanction&quot; for his actions -- either expulsion or censure with loss of privileges. <br /><br />&quot;Senator Monserrate&#039;s misconduct damages the integrity and the reputation of the New York State Senate and demonstrates a lack of fitness to serve in this body,&quot; the committee concluded. <br /><br />&quot;I am very troubled by the facts and circumstances surrounding Sen. Monserrate&#039;s conduct,&quot; said Sen. Andrew Lanza, R-Staten Island. <br /><br />Team Monserrate said the Senate has no authority to do anything to him, and he won&#039;t recognize their actions. <br /><br />&quot;If they vote to expel him he will still be a state senator and he&#039;ll be in chamber and he&#039;ll do all the things that he&#039;s doing for the people that he serves,&quot; attorney Joseph Tacopina said.<br /><br />For his part, Monserrate appears confident.<br /><br />&quot;The voters of this community in this next election will be those who determine who shall represent them and who shall not. And their decision is the one that will ultimately decide my fate,&quot; Monserrate said.<br /><br />Even if the Senate does punish him, and their actions are upheld in court, Monserrate still has the right to run for the seat again in November. <br /><br />If he wins he can serve.

				I&#039;m pretty sure, with his oversized ego, that Hiram will have to be dragged kicking and screaming from public office, much in the same way as Ms. Giraldo had to be dragged from his apartment building against her will.<br /><br />On a separate note - &quot;Earbears&quot; - what happened to your old kitty photo, the one with the rabbit ears?&nbsp; It&#039;s my favorite in the whole world!

				According to the following article, Monserrate does plan to put up a fight to retain his seat.<br /><br /><strong>CityHallNews.com</strong><br />Monserrate Vows To Run In Special Election For Own Seat (http://www.cityhallnews.com/newyork/article-1098-monserrate-vows-to-run-in-special-election-for-own-seat.html)<br />Accuses Senate of using explulsion to improve its public image<br />By Sal Gentile<br /><br />If expelled by his colleagues, embattled Queens Sen. Hiram Monserrate will run in a special election to regain the seat he now holds, he said in an exclusive interview with City Hall on Thursday.<br /><br />A special committee charged with mulling Monserrate&#039;s fate recommended on Thursday that the full Senate vote on a resolution to oust him, which Senate officials believe will have broad support among Republicans and Democrats in the chamber.<br /><br />In an interview in the basement of his East Elmhurst district office later that afternoon, Monserrate made clear that lawmakers hoping to put the episode behind them would have to contend with him in at least one, if not two more elections, as well as a potentially drawn-out legal battle.<br /><br />â€œI fully expect to be running and to put my record of accomplishment to the voters of this district and move forward,â€ Monserrate said in the interview. â€œSo Iâ€™m prepared to challenge, to debate intelligently, based on the facts and not hysteria, my record and my role as a public servant with anyone.â€ <br /><br />Monserrate would not say if that included a potential special election, which Gov. David Paterson would have the option to call if the Senate votes to expel Monserrate. But a source close to the embattled Queens lawmakers later confirmed that he would run in either a special election or the general election in the fall, saying: â€œWhatever it is, weâ€™re running.â€<br /><br />If the Senate does remove Monserrate, the governor would have to issue a proclamation calling for a special election to fill the seat. The Queens Democratic Party will likely nominate Monserrate&#039;s declared opponent, Assembly Member Jose Peralta, meaning Monserrate would have to petition independently onto the ballot.<br /><br />State election law does not mandate a time frame for a special election, but Senate Democrats are likely to ask the governor to move quickly in order to fill the seat and provide them with a crucial 32nd vote.<br /><br /><strong>Senate Democrats had already begun moving to expel Monserrate even before the Special Committee of Inquiry released its report on Thursday, out of fear that as an incumbent in a Democratic primary he would be able to fend off a challenge from Peralta.</strong><br /><br />Sen. Brian Foley, of Suffolk, had already promised in December to introduce a resolution calling for Monserrateâ€™s removal regardless of the committeeâ€™s findings.<br /><br />Monserrate said that those actions proved that the effort to remove him had more to do with the Senateâ€™s poor public imageâ€”resulting, in part, from a month-long coup Monserrate helped instigate in Juneâ€”than with the facts of his assault case. <br /><br /><strong>[Follow above link for complete article]</strong><br /><br />My thoughts on the highlighted section in red:&nbsp; After all the controversy Monserrate has been involved in... really?&nbsp; This is scary!!!

				Censure, expulsion or no action at all... Are we really any closer to a resolution on Monserrate?&nbsp; Now they&#039;re talking that an expulsion of Monserrate may set precedent due to his acquittal on the felony charge.&nbsp; According to the NY Times article below state law reserves expulsions for legislators convicted of felonies, and Monserrate&#039;s conviction was for misdemeanor.&nbsp; And to delay things even more, some dems are hesitating on an expulsion because it may inflame racial tensions.<br /><br /><strong>The New York Times</strong><br />Push to Force Monserrate Expulsion Vote in the Senate (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/nyregion/08hiram.html)<br />By JEREMY W. PETERS<br />Published: February 7, 2010<br /><br />A group of Senate Democrats, concerned about efforts within their party to block the removal of a senator convicted of domestic violence, say they will attempt to force a vote to expel him this week even if they cannot win the support of State Senate leaders. <br /><br />The senators are trying to head off an effort by other Democrats who are pushing for a vote to censure, but not expel, Hiram Monserrate, the Queens Democrat who was found guilty last fall of assaulting his companion.<br /><br />Over the weekend, Gov. David A. Paterson added to the momentum to remove Mr. Monserrate from office, signaling that he would immediately call a special election if Mr. Monserrate is expelled. An administration official said Sunday that Mr. Paterson would set the date of the election for 30 days after Mr. Monserrateâ€™s removal.<br /><br />Some Democrats opposed to ousting Mr. Monserrate have expressed concern that his expulsion would temporarily destabilize the narrow balance of power in the Senate. Action on most legislation and procedural matters requires 32 votes. If Mr. Monserrate is removed, the Senate would have 31 Democrats and 30 Republicans.<br /><br />Though a number of outcomes are possible in the ever-unpredictable Senate, including censure, expulsion or no action at all, a consensus is emerging that Mr. Monserrate will face a vote on his fate by the full Senate by Tuesday. The motion the Senate will vote on, however, remains unclear.<br /><br />While removal appears to have the broadest support among both parties, expelling Mr. Monserrate is a fractious issue. No one has been removed from office in the Legislature since the 1920s, and state law reserves automatic expulsion for state legislators who have been convicted of felonies. Mr. Monserrate was convicted of misdemeanor assault but acquitted of a felony charge after being involved in a fight that left his companion, Karla Giraldo, with deep cuts on her face. His staff did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.<br /><br /><strong>[Follow above link for complete article]</strong><br />

Brian Foley, were: Monserrate, Ruben Diaz Sr., Majority Leader Pedro Espada Jr., Carl Kruger, Eric Adams, Kevin Parker, Martin Malave Dilan and Conference Leader John Sampson. Sen. Tom Morahan was excused. <br />The vote was taken by a show of hands, as requested by Sen. Tom Libous. There was very little debate. <br />No one who voted in favor of expelling Monserrate rose to defend their decision. Diaz and Espada both explained their votes, with Diaz condemning the entire chamber as hypocrites and Espada going out of his way to praise Sampson, but also saying he believed Monserrate had been denied due process. <br />Diaz also insisted the vote was being taken in retribution for Monserrate&#039;s participation in the June 8 coup. <br />Monserrate entered the chamber with Espada after the vote was taken. He then delivered a 16 minute speech, first noting that he was being punished for something he did before he even took office. (He was technically still a councilman in December 2008 and also a senator-elect). <br /><br /><br />Click here for more....<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />New York Senate Expels Monserrate Over Assault<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />By JEREMY W. PETERS<br />The New York Times<br />Published: February 9, 2010<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />ALBANY - The State Senate on Tuesday expelled a senator convicted of domestic assault, the first time in nearly a century that the Legislature has forced a member from office. <br /><br /><br />The Senate voted 53-to-8 to immediately oust the senator, Hiram Monserrate, a Queens Democrat convicted last fall of a misdemeanor for dragging his companion down the hallway of his apartment building. <br />The expulsion leaves the fragile balance of power in the Senate divided between 31 Democrats and 30 Republicans. Because legislation requires 32 votes to pass, Democrats will be unable to approve bills with just the support of their own conference. In an effort to minimize the disruption, Gov. David A. Paterson late Tuesday called a special election for March 16. <br /><br />But rather than bringing the issue to a close, the expulsion vote could be the beginning of a lengthy legal fight that could create further instability in Albany&#039;s volatile political atmosphere. Mr. Monserrate said on Tuesday that he planned to run in the special election. <br /><br /><br />Click here to view complete article...........<br />&nbsp;<br />State Senate votes to boot Sen.

Hiram Monserrate was ousted from his seat Tuesday night by colleagues who say his conviction for misdemeanor assault against his girlfriend brought shame on the chamber.<br /><br />Disgusted Democrats and Republicans joined together 53-8 to make Monserrate the fourth sitting state lawmaker ever expelled - and the first since 1861.<br /><br />&quot;Sen. Monserrate&#039;s abusive and unlawful conduct damages the integrity of the New York state Senate and demonstrates a lack of fitness to serve in this body,&quot; Sen.

				Hiram Monserrate and his attorney, Norman Siegel, were supposed to appear at Manhattan Federal Court today to file papers to prevent the special election scheduled for March 16th, and also to fight the Senate&#039;s decision of expulsion. &nbsp;According to Siegel, Monserrate was not given due process of the law, and the Senate has no constitutional right to expel him. &nbsp;They&#039;re saying that only Monserrate&#039;s constituents have the right to not re-elect him. &nbsp;Apparently, current state laws allow for expulsion based on felony convictions, not misdemeanors. &nbsp;Wasn&#039;t it Espada that recently proposed some type of legislation to include misdemeanors also? &nbsp;Unfortunately, if that were to take effect, it wouldn&#039;t be retroactive, thereby excluding Monserrate. &nbsp;Hmmm...politicking at its best. &nbsp; Norman Siegel is a high profile civil rights attorney. &nbsp;If anyone can fight this fight for Monserrate, it will be Siegel.

				Hello,<br /><br />I worked for years with a Constitutional Law Professor, Leon Friedman, who did a lot of work with Normal Siegel on various cases regarding First Amendment, Constitutional and Civil Rights Law. &nbsp;Mr. Siegel may have taken Monserrate&#039;s case as pro bono. &nbsp;<br /><br />This may be helpful:<br /><br />&quot;Pro bono legal counsel may assist an individual or group on a legal case by filing government applications or petitions. A judge may occasionally determine that the loser should compensate a winning pro bono counsel.<br /><br />Lawyers in the United States are recommended under American Bar Association (ABA) ethical rules to contribute at least fifty hours of pro bono service per year.&quot;<br /><br />Best, &nbsp; :smiley6600:<br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t vote for monserrate, but I don&#039;t like how the senators are above the law. Shouldn&#039;t he pay his court given penalty and that be it? He&#039;s only supposed to be removed b/c of a felony, I believe. So are these senators smarter than the ones who wrote the laws? or is this an exception? What he was convicted of seems like an excuse to get him removed. Keep in mind, that he was acquited of most of the charges. <br />If anything, there should be a vote to have him removed by his constituents. <br /><br />personally, I think Gary Ackerman&#039;s business dealings are more of a reason for expulsion from his position than this. And I like(d) ackerman.

				Jeff, I see your point.&nbsp; The only thing I can theorize is that somehow there was a felony charge, that may have been plead or a ltered to a misdeameanor, or some similar sort of wiggle room that allowed the vote to take place.&nbsp; (Admittedly I have not been following this as closely as many here and on jhfamilies ...)<br /><br />That said, I was one of the many on this poll that voted &quot;yes&quot; to him out, and &quot;no&quot; to him re-running.&nbsp; I have little tolerance for domestic violence, and besides, some of his decisions were not the finest IMHO.

				Having quickly read through the PDF of the judge&#039;s decision, his reasoning seems sound and I think it should hold up to Monserrate&#039;s appeal... <br />Now let&#039;s all go to the polls on March 16th and make sure we get a new state senator who&#039;ll do the right thing for our community! <br /><br />:rockon:<br />

				THIS IS FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO DREAMED WITH HIRAM&#039;S VICTORY ONCE UPON A TIME...!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:2funny:<br /><br /><br />Judge Declines to Reverse Monserrateâ€™s Expulsion From the State Senate<br />By JEREMY W. PETERS<br />Published: February 19, 2010<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Sign in to Recommend<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Twitter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Sign In to E-Mail<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Print<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reprints<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * ShareClose<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o Linkedin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o Digg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o Facebook<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o Mixx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o MySpace<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o Yahoo! Buzz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o Permalink<br />o<br /><br />A federal judge on Friday refused to reinstate former Senator Hiram Monserrate, the first member of the New York State Legislature removed from office since the 1920s, rejecting Mr. Monserrateâ€™s claims that his expulsion was unconstitutional.<br /><br />Writing that a legislative bodyâ€™s power to expel its members is â€œembedded in American Democracy,â€ Judge William H. Pauley of United States District Court in Manhattan denied Mr. Monserrateâ€™s request to have his removal blocked and the special election to replace him halted.<br /><br />The decision about who should represent Mr. Monserrateâ€™s former district in Queens should be left to the voters and not to the courts, Judge Pauley said.<br /><br />The ruling marked the first decision in what could be a lengthy appeals process for Mr. Monserrate. Judge Pauleyâ€™s order applied only to Mr. Monserrateâ€™s most immediate request to the court: to block his expulsion so he could return to the Senate when it reconvenes on Monday.<br /><br />The case is expected to proceed in Judge Pauleyâ€™s court, though lawyers for Mr. Monserrate said they were strongly considering an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.<br /><br />Norman Siegel, one of Mr. Monserrateâ€™s lawyers, said the judgeâ€™s ruling â€œopens the door to arbitrary and unfettered decisions that violate the rights of duly elected officials and their constituents.â€<br /><br />But Judge Pauley rejected Mr. Monserrateâ€™s argument that the people of his district were disenfranchised, writing that the impediment to voting rights was â€œgossamer.â€<br /><br />â€œThe burden here,â€ Judge Pauley wrote, â€œis no greater than the occasional vacancies due to death or resignation.â€<br /><br />Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, whose office is defending the Senate in the case, said he was gratified by the decision. â€œThe time for changing the culture of Albany is long past due,â€ Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. â€œTodayâ€™s ruling is a step in that direction.â€<br /><br />The ruling raised numerous questions about the merits of Mr. Monserrateâ€™s legal claims and indicated that the court would ultimately decide against him if he pressed on with the case. Judge Pauley was especially skeptical of the arguments that Mr. Monserrateâ€™s rights were violated under the 1st and 14th Amendments.<br /><br />His lawyers alleged that the expulsion process was not only unfair and unconstitutional, but was also political payback for Mr. Monserrateâ€™s role in a leadership coup last summer and his critical public comments about the Senateâ€™s investigation into his conduct.<br /><br />Mr. Monserrateâ€™s lawyers said his ouster was an unlawful coup, a choice of words the judge said he found to be â€œan ironic twist.â€<br /><br />Judge Pauley was also not persuaded by Mr. Monserrateâ€™s claims that he was denied due process by the special Senate committee that recommended his expulsion. The judge noted that the former senator refused to testify before the committee or present evidence in his favor.<br /><br />Mr. Monserrateâ€™s lawyers also argued that the provision of state law the Senate relied on to expel him was too vague. But the judge was not persuaded.<br /><br />The law, he wrote, is a â€œshort and plainâ€ statement that is â€œneither standardless nor so unclear that a person of reasonable intelligence could not understand its meaning and application.â€<br /><br />The Senate removed Mr. Monserrate by a vote of 53 to 8, citing his conduct in a violent confrontation in 2008 that left his female companion with a deep gash on her face. A judge acquitted him of felony assault charges but convicted him of a misdemeanor for dragging her down a hallway â€” an act caught on videotape.<br /><br />State law provides for the automatic expulsion of any legislator convicted of a felony, but it is silent with regard to misdemeanors. The judge said that simply because the law did not spell out every circumstance under which a legislator might be expelled â€œdoes not make the statute vague or overbroad.â€<br />A version of this article appeared in print on February 20, 2010, on page A11 of the New York edition.<br />

				THIS IS ONE OF THE PETTY ATTACKS HE&#039;S USING AGAINST OUR NEXT SENATOR. IT SHOWS THE LACK OF REASONING HE&#039;S USING TO WIN THE RACE. <br /><br /><br />Monserrateâ€™s questions why Peralta silent on the paterson scandal: http://thebuffalopuertoricanpress.wordpress.com/<br /><br />Former Senator Hiram Monserrate new line of defense isâ€Peraltaâ€™s lack of public comment on whether he supports Gov. David Paterson,â€ reported in the City Hall news on Tuesday.<br /><br />In talking with reporters Monserrate said, â€œIâ€™ve had disagreements with him on policyâ€”the Senate most certainly has at different timesâ€”but I believe that he can continue to do the basic job of being governor until the next election, which is a few months away.â€<br /><br />Hm? Whatever happened to accusations Governor Paterson issued about Monserrate when he issued a statement to the press that he got off too easy, a slap in the wrist in his own case of domestic violence earlier that catapulted his ouster from the Senate.<br /><br />In fact in the NY Daily News article on February 13, the governor , â€œâ€¦unloaded on the Queens Democrat, saying the deposed legislator was lucky he didnâ€™t get slapped with felony charges for pressuring girlfriend Karla Giraldo to change her story about the night her face was sliced with a broken glass.â€<br /><br />While Assembly Peralta responded to Mr. Monserrate rightfully by saying, â€œThe accusations against Governor Paterson are deeply troubling,â€&nbsp; ( and)&nbsp; â€œDomestic violence is a serious issue and any attempt to intimidate or manipulate a victim of domestic violence is a grave matter. I am confident that Attorney General Cuomo will investigate this matter fully and quickly so that the voters of the State of New York can know all of the facts.â€<br /><br />Although, the ouster&nbsp; of Monserrate was wrongful more so in the wake of the governorâ€™s own domestic violence scandal, its disappointing that he is vocal about a governor few are rallying around any longer while using Peraltaâ€™s silence as a campaign issue.&nbsp; Assemblyman Peralta is correct in issuing the statement about the governor and Monserrateâ€™s position is a very troubling one.<br />
