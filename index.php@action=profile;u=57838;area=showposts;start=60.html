The people I know who are younger, dating and going out, are all doing it in Astoria, LIC and Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn. To be young in JH seems to mean being on the train a lot going to these centers of gravity where all your friends are. This is a neighborhood for people who go home to their families after dinner, or for ... whoever goes to those bars on Roosevelt, always a mystery to me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bars are not a mystery. Jackson Heights is the Lantinx Gay center of NYC. And young. Who&#039;s to say that OP isn&#039;t Gay and Latinx? We live in the Latinx Gay Hells Kitchen of Queens!

You&#039;ll see...it&#039;s a hoot pretty much 7 nights a week...<br /><br />I am beginning to think that folks don&#039;t really know the neighborhood they are living in?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, the IT analyst from Long Island is gonna have a hoot of a time frequenting the massage prostitutes of Roosevelt Avenue. A hoot and a half! Then straight to the overcrowded Filipino nightclubs until 7am! Eat your heart out Williamsburg!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />what&#039;s with the anti-Filipino bigotry?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Who said anything anti? Who even said it&#039;s wrong to be overcrowded? That&#039;s a party. And lest we talk of assumptions, maybe I&#039;ve been to these places, and maybe I love &#039;em. But I&#039;m not an IT analyst from Long Island looking for an apartment in Jackson Heights. Curious what OP thinks of this amazing forum and if their questions have been answered! Which national background and sexual orientation will be represented by the club they will be frequenting upon a move to our historic and diverse neighborhood? I think that&#039;s really at the heart of their post. I know it started with a simple question about affordability and moving, but since it pivoted quickly to Latinx Gay representation and the bar scene of said cohort, how about we just stick to the latter?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great. You can organize a tour of these bars for the folks on this forum who haven&#039;t been.<br /><br />Those who think Jackson Heights is only for bickering about 34th Ave and family life. And seem to want to minimize the nightlife in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />You can open their eyes to the many true wonders of our neighborhood. <br /><br />Those which are hiding in plain sight but some folks seem not to have discovered. <br /><br />This forum is absolutely the right place for this information. Because some of us have not ignored that side of Jackson Heights...which is huge and vibrant...&nbsp; practiced our Spanish and learned all about it and think it&#039;s pretty awesome. And fun.<br /><br />And to assume otherwise simply reveals the narrow and limited mindset of those who do the assuming.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The draw of that world is a true asset here in JH though it seems more subdued over the years we&#039;ve been here. My spider sense is that is not their arena. Also varies tremendously with male/female identities and size particularly when it comes to Roosevelt Ave, transit and later nights. Still think it&#039;s a better plan to wait, make more $ and circle back around. Northern Blvd seems more plausible for newer entertainment and venues, as stated. East Elmhurst might have easier routes to purchasing than JH co-ops which can be very demanding even for some much more established applicants.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Assumptions about folks are most likely wrong<br /><br />So many assumptions have been made about me.<br />And I always find them hilarious.<br />And always wrong. <br /><br />Psychologically, assumptions reveal the mindset of those assuming.<br /><br />And not the person to whom the assumption is being directed.

					Welcome to the neighborhood OP!<br /><br />If you can afford it...GO FOR IT!<br /><br />Only you know your own financials...maybe you have made $s or inherited $s? Good for u!<br /><br />As a base for having fun...Jackson Heights works IMO. It certainly has in my case. <br /><br />

					The above is pretty spot on<br /><br />But if you don&#039;t have a car...and are near Roosevelt Ave...public transport is great and you can get anywhere in NYC. So not having a car becomes a positive.

					Itsit loves being contrary. It&#039;s a hobby for Itsit.<br /><br />The OP is looking for somewhere to buy. In truth anywhere hipper is far more expensive to buy into. <br /><br />Living in NYC is always a compromise.<br /><br />Maybe in the olden days everyone young lived in the same neighborhood. But my experience of New York is that my friends live where they can afford. That means from Forest Hills to Crown Heights or Bushwick to Inwood/Washington Heights etc.<br /><br />And I travel often to those neighborhoods to meet them.<br /><br />And transport is great from here.<br /><br />So Jackson Heights works out ok.<br /><br />If instead of investing in crypto or NFTs a person wants to invest in their apartment...then Jackson Heights is one of the few places in NY where apartments are more affordable.<br /><br />The prices are approx equal to Inwood. But the location and transport options are better in Jackson Hts IMO.<br /><br />So the OP has few options in truth when it comes to affordable buying in NYC.<br /><br />Midwood, Brooklyn? Inwood/Washington Hts, Manhattan? The Bronx? Jackson Hts?<br /><br />Since the OP is from Long Island...Forest Hills could also be a possible solution for them price-wise.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					Lots of younger folks are moving to Jackson Hts if they want to buy.<br /><br />I did and it turned out great.<br /><br />Transport to Sunnyside and Astoria is easy...or even bike...<br />Getting to Brooklyn is do-able ...with the E to the G... especially compared with pals who are in Washington Hts and Inwood. <br /><br />The F gets you to the LES no problem.<br /><br />I have found that the transport options from Roosevelt Ave to get anywhere in NYC where you need to meet friends is a real plus. <br /><br />Your pals will come only once or twice a year...from hipper neighborhoods...but they will always have a fun time when they get here...with the diverse food etc. (They even marvel at how lucky we are to have the Open Street of 34th Ave.)<br /><br />If you are financially minded...it&#039;s an investment. That works out ok.<br /><br />Otherwise you can rent in Brooklyn or LES etc of course. Like most younger folks. It&#039;s harder to buy there unless you have $&#039;s. Lots of $&#039;s. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

					My advice (and experience) is that it is worth doing if you can.<br /><br />Prices in Jax Hts are still less than many other locations in NYC. (Not the Bronx which is quite a bit less expensive)<br /><br />If you really doin&#039;t have a huge amount of $&#039;s look at smaller apartments which are cheaper here. (Under 200K)<br /><br />Or buildings like Southridge ( a little further) or Roosevelt Tce (25% flip tax on profit when sold)...these are not as pricey due to the mentioned&nbsp; reasons.
