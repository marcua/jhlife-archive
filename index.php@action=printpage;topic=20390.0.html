				This YouTuber went to JH and made what I think is a very informative video of JH that I thought the community would like:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWNCGx7uU_4&amp;t=21s<br /><br />

				Thanks for sharing.&nbsp; Although he briefly mentions the garden apartments Jackson Heights is known for, I am struck by the fact that he pretty much neglects the beauty inherent in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Namely, the architecture and landscaping in the historic district which makes this neighborhood much nicer than so many others.&nbsp; Perhaps he&#039;s never been here in spring, summer or fall when the beauty of Jackson Heights truly shines.&nbsp;

				This is a great video of the neighborhood.<br />And highlights what makes Jackson Heights unique in NYC...and maybe the world...<br /><br />1930&#039;s garden apartments are pretty common in Sunnyside, Forest Hills, Kew Gdns, Forest Park, Riverdale, other neighborhoods of The Bronx, Los Angeles, London,&nbsp; etc, etc. They are not what makes Jackson Heights different.<br /><br />What&#039;s in the video is the reason for Jackson Height&#039;s distinction. It&#039;s a diverse immigrant melting pot.<br /><br />Probably the 21st century equivalent of the LES of the 1900&#039;s. <br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;It&#039;s almost a given that Jackson Heights features are on 74th Street or Roosevelt Ave. It would be fine by me if it was Northern Blvd which has more locals but my point is the commercial district may not be truly reflective of the neighborhood. Diversity Plaza looked awful here, in my opinion. It feels like they were going for known specialty places rather than what the residents here might really do in an ordinary day. It might take a real JH resident to be able to access various indoor spaces that are not commercial so it&#039;s all working the perimeter and not in any way the version of the JH neighborhood our friends and family see when visiting. I do understand this is a tourist type thing on Youtube but still. He did seem to have read his history though...and it certainly could&#039;ve been worse.

In the video.<br /><br />(Fifth avenue, it ain&#039;t.) <br /><br />Roosevelt Ave etc is the most interesting part if you&#039;re visiting as a day tourist. <br /><br />No-one can see the interior gardens, they&#039;re completely hidden, so that&#039;s not interesting. All touristy folks can see from the side streets is exterior walls of 5 story 1920&#039;s/30&#039;s red brick buildings. Common in every borough of NYC.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Personally, I find a whole lot more charm in Jackson Heights than I do in most of the rest of the city.&nbsp;

				Jackson Heights is great...for its diversity...<br /><br />But let&#039;s face it, parts of Forest Hills Gdns, Kew Gdns, Sunnyside Gdns, Forest Park, Brooklyn Hts, Riverdale, Park Slope, Inwood etc, etc (many more)... are very attractive, charming neighborhoods.<br /><br />IMO just because a person lives somewhere they like...doesn&#039;t mean they have to be blind to the beauty of the rest of the city.&nbsp;

				Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill, Forest Hills Gardens, Park Slope, Ditmas Park are all very nice and I almost named them in my previous post.&nbsp; That said, the youtube video focussed on the ugly side of Jackson Heights, completely neglecting the charming side of the neighborhood.&nbsp; And that&#039;s my beef.&nbsp;
