				Looking for a deli that makes bacon, egg &amp; cheese, chopped cheese and other deli sandwiches in the Jackson Heights area that is not K&amp;L. Looking for a typical NYC bodega sandwich, not a fancy one. <br /><br />Thanks in advance

Now, it has started migrating from grill tops to restaurant menus, from the lyrics of rappers onto the pages of food blogs.<br /><br />But this wider recognition has come with a side of controversy.<br /><br />In June, a video made by a 20-year-old man from Harlem as a retort to a segment about the sandwich went viral, igniting a discussion about culture and privilege. The news that a new restaurant on the Upper West Side would feature a version costing more than $10 provoked another round of criticism.

				It&#039;s possible that the info online is outdated, but the 8001 Gourmet Deli on Northern Blvd seems to have a lot of traditional deli menu items.<br /><br />https://www.ubereats.com/new-york/food-delivery/8001-gourmet-deli/n8_35nIGQJ6YWmAy_bg91Q

When I lived in Brooklyn, there were many bodegas with cheap sandwiches (along with nicer delis like K&amp;L). I was just wondering if that existed here but I don’t think it really does. Maybe in Astoria

				Best bacon egg n cheese I have ever had is at Delicias Calenas, the colombian bakery on 73rd and 37th. They make their own bread (I think), and they fry the bacon. SOooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good!

				If you&#039;re going to Astoria, try Sorriso on 30th Ave. Killer sandwiches, great homemade salami, and they know how to properly slice prosciutto di parma.

				dssjh:&nbsp; Shah uses a Halal Turkey Ham for their egg sandwiches.&nbsp; I don&#039;t order their egg sandwich but I do purchase the Turkey Ham which is exceptional and worth $9 lb.&nbsp; &nbsp;I prefer making my own egg sandwiches at home using &quot;Bread Alone 9 Grain&quot;, from Lemon Farm.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Turkey Ham is made from the turkey thigh with spices and it looks and tastes like ham.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avoid Jenny&#039;s Turkey Ham sold at Food Dynasty and other stores that&#039;s horrible.&nbsp; <br /><br />
