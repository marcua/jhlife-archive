				Title: <strong>Holiday Decorations at PS 69</strong><br />

				When I went in to vote today at PS 69 I was met with the the traditional Thanksgiving holiday decorations - turkeys, cornucopias, leaves, and the like.&nbsp; Along with these decorations was a stylized image of an Indian holding a basket of corn and wearing a headband with a feather - right next to the images of the turkey, etc.&nbsp; I looked around and couldn&#039;t find anyone from the school to talk with so I took down the picture and brought it over to the security guard in the foyer and asked to speak with someone from the school.&nbsp; Nobody was available so I left a note explaining that the context of this image is offensive and it should not be on display.<br /><br />A few minutes later (as I was getting my ballot, no less) a woman who worked at the school rushed over to me, screaming, demanding to know why I took down the holiday decoration.&nbsp; I calmly explained that this image should NOT be used in a holiday display and that I find it offensive.&nbsp; This woman (I didn&#039;t get her name, unfortunately) said that I had no place to remove the image and that I have no say in what happens in the school because I don&#039;t work there and don&#039;t have a child in the school.&nbsp; I explained that I&#039;m a community member and I DO certainly have the right (and responsibility, IMO) to take part in ensuring that the children of our community are educated in a responsible, respectful manner.&nbsp; This woman (wish I had her name!) said that they do teach about Indians as part of history and stormed off.<br /><br />There are quite a few things that I found troubling in this exchange.<br />1) A stylized image of a nameless Native American should NOT be part of a holiday display which also includes images of a roasted turkey.<br />2) Teaching about Native Americans in the context of Thanksgiving - as part of history, a culture that existed only in the past - perpetuates the line of thinking that Native Americans are a historical, extinct culture which is not present in NYC.&nbsp; <br />3) The principal/school leaders/PTA/etc. should welcome the participation of ALL members of the community (particularly since they are a publicly-funded institution).<br />4) The woman who yelled at me did so WHILE I WAS VOTING and caused quite a dramatic scene in front of other voters and poll workers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I doubt that the people who hung up these decorations intended to offend anyone; however, for an educator NOT to recognize why this image is offensive (or, seek to enter a discussion about WHY this image may be perceived as offensive) is very troubling.&nbsp;

				Hey everyone, I&#039;m looking into buying in the area and trying to figure out which buildings are which -- there&#039;s a lot!<br /><br />So I guess I&#039;m trying to figure out which ones are more desirable, which I should be wary of, etc....<br />I have in mind that pre-war buildings are best, but is that true? I want to live close to 74th Street, but are those buildings lesser buildings? <br /><br />I do have Daniel Karatzas book, but I want to know the not-fit-for-print opinions on the buildings. Got anything???

				Title: <strong>Empty space on Northern Blvd for a health club?</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>dotley</strong> on <strong>March 05, 2013, 07:12:01 AM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I noticed that Blockbusters, on Northern Blvd, is going out of business.&nbsp; That space combined with the empty former Mandy&#039;s would make a perfect spot for a health club.&nbsp; Who does one talk to or how does one go about recruiting businesses to this area?&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; I think this area could support both a high end health club like NY Sports Club and a less expensive one like Planet Fitness.

				There is a greenmarket on Tuesdays located behind Elmhurst Hospital.&nbsp; Meredith&#039;s Bread has a booth there.&nbsp; In addition to breads, muffins and cookies he has a large selection of gluten free items.&nbsp; I inquired about adding this vendor to the Jackson Heights greenmarket and was told there was no room.&nbsp; Perhaps a few more voices would help &quot;create a space&quot;? The vendor is interested.<br />
