					Opposition to illegal immigration and resentment of immigrants who don&#039;t go through legal channels to apply for citizenship does not equate to support for Trump or his immigration policies.&nbsp; I like a few of the things the Trump administration has done, like criminal justice reforms. I still think he&#039;s a dangerous, incompetent liar and would-be autocrat, and I&#039;d prefer any of the Dem candidates to him.&nbsp; Why assume legal immigrants in Jackson Heights who support his immigration policies also support him?

					&quot;If the bill passed both houses of the NYS legislators before the election then it is not improper to sign it into law. It lets people’s vote count regardless of minor irregularities. I think that is fair&quot;<br /><br />Uh, I&#039;m sorry.&nbsp; That does not seem &quot;fair&quot; at all. We&#039;re in the middle of a recount based on existing rules.&nbsp; Changing the rules to favor one candidate or the other, regardless of who ends up getting an advantage, would be legislative interference. How is that different from selectively invalidating Democratic votes in the Deep South because poll stations stayed open a little late?&nbsp; &nbsp;Voters are clearly divided here.&nbsp; As a party, Dems need to accept that reality, work with the rules as they exist and do their best to prevent yet another intra-party circular firing squad from hampering the chance for reforms both candidates claim to favor.

					You might be blocked by a paywall, but an article from <a href="http://the Washington Post magazine" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">the Washington Post magazine</a> about AOC&#039;s Chief of Staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, is revealing and, to me, a little disturbing.&nbsp; He clearly considers himself the chief of staff of a &quot;movement,&quot; not just a Congressional office.&nbsp; Leaving aside his recent unfortunate tweet accusing moderate Dems of racism,&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any indication that he or AOC see themselves as responsible to the people in their District. The comments here about the lack of constituent services reflect this problem. Are they actually in touch with people in District 14, other than a small core of activists? Do they have a mechanism to hear from ordinary folk who need their help?&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy for someone to explain that the answer is yes, but it doesn&#039;t seem that way...<br /><br />Here is the URL again:<br /><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/07/10/feature/how-saikat-chakrabarti-became-aocs-chief-of-change/?utm_term=.da3fd4f42e98" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/07/10/feature/how-saikat-chakrabarti-became-aocs-chief-of-change/?utm_term=.da3fd4f42e98</a>

					Crowley&#039;s District Office always responded. Maybe not right away, but somebody always got back to me.&nbsp; Not true in this case. I&#039;m rooting for AOC and admire how she&#039;s introduced topics into the national conversation that ought to be discussed, like the Green New Deal. But I don&#039;t see any signs that her office is able to handle rudimentary constituent services.<br />

					I&#039;m in one of the garden co-ops that changed the rules and gradually allowed kids more freedom. Lately a bunch of new young families have moved in and sometimes it is a real problem. Some residents (like me) often want to sit and enjoy a quiet conversation or read but there are times when a swath of the property is covered with screaming kids with no adult supervision. I understand kids want to play and yell, but it&#039;s wrong to criticize &quot;old folks&quot; (and other folks) for wanting peace in a shared space that is an amenity they are paying for...Finding a balance has been very difficult.<br />

					The bill to decriminalize sex work makes it illegal to punish customers, not just sex workers&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s why it is opposed by some feminists, who rallied against it not long ago, as noted here: <a href="https://carolynmaloney.com/the-feminist-divide-over-decriminalizing-sex-work/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://carolynmaloney.com/the-feminist-divide-over-decriminalizing-sex-work/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It is difficult for me to envision how the bill Ramos is supporting will stop the sex trade in JH. If anything, it will make the street scene after midnight more sleazy.&nbsp; It&#039;s been widely acknowledged that creating the Red Light district in Amsterdam, where prostitution is legal and regulated by the government, was a well-intentioned mistake and it is going to be abolished.&nbsp;

					Well, with 98% of the District reporting, he got about 11,700 or so votes and she got 15,000 plus. It&#039;s true that he took the race for granted until the 11th hour. But if he hadn&#039;t, would he have been able to generate a lot more voters, more enthusiasm? That&#039;s a sincere question. I have no idea...

					Well, my family and I have been there twice and while I love the vibe, and its been great to sit near neighbors I know and to meet new friends (in the section where tables are very close to each other), I would have to say the actual menu is...a work in progress. The swordfish (not on the menu last night), fusilli, fluke and leek salad were delicious.But last night several of us had the scallops and they were drenched in too much pepper.&nbsp; That marred what would have otherwise been a tasty apple/corn sauce (don&#039;t remember the exact ingredients, forgive me foodies!).&nbsp; The first time, I had the roast chicken and I must say it was serviceable but underwhelming, nothing special. This is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and we are thrilled to have it around and are rooting for it, so I hope honest feedback will help.

					Re: &quot;weird posts.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Uh, you might be right that Crowley&#039;s vote against a key provision of Dodd-Frank was motivated in part by campaign contributions. He is, by no means, perfect.&nbsp; Here was his explanation in the NY Times, for what it&#039;s worth: &quot;<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">&quot;Mr. Crowley, in a statement, said his vote in favor of the bill was not related to Wall Street donations, but a desire to fund other important government programs. “I do not support jamming controversial provisions in at the last minute that are completely unrelated to the business of funding the government,” the statement said.&quot;</div><br />The comment about New Visions was in response to earlier posts noting their vote to endorse Crowley. I was just trying to give some background.&nbsp; I am glad Dromm and her campaign are not feuding now. Waste of energy.

					At the New Visions meeting, Danny Dromm spoke out against her because early on, she and her people treated it as part of the staid old Democratic machine, as opposed to a relatively independent progressive club. They actually threatened to picket one of the meetings. She sent out some nasty tweets about him.&nbsp; Apparently some of this is very personal and I&#039;m sure she has explanations, but it does show she has not been very smart about local politics. You&#039;re not going to find a more progressive City Council Member than Danny Dromm...She snubbed him.

					I don&#039;t know what people are expecting one Member of Congress to &quot;deliver&quot; locally. He was and is on the right side of the most important issues.&nbsp; At the debate, he pointed out that he actively resisted Obama&#039;s immigrant detention policies that, for awhile, were odious to the progressive left (and to me!). He said he favored single payer health insurance and elsewhere has supported Medicare for All. Yes, he gets funded by corporations and banks, but he pushed hard for Dodd-Frank. This is a national emergency. He might be the next Speaker of the House which would give this District a concrete chance to do something about that emergency. Among other things, it would mean all the energies now being dedicated to defeating him could be dedicated to keeping him honest and true to his values once he is elected. But this is precisely the wrong time to bring in an untested newcomer
