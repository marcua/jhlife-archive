				I have wondered this ever since I moved here and heard the rent on the Beauty Supply place on 84th St. and 37th Ave. is or was $17,000 per month.<br /><br />Now someone mentions in another thread that the shoe repair place on 37th Ave between 84th and 85th is not going to renew their lease because the rent is supposed to triple (though I don&#039;t know the dollar amount on the current rent so don&#039;t know how outrageous the new rent will be).<br /><br />How do all the luggage/cheap gift places (etc.) stay alive or even manage to open in the first place?&nbsp; Are they really doing that much business?

				They probably get small business loans as incentives to start up a local business and depending on the type of store get a large customer rate.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;d be surprised how popular cheap luggage is!

				Raw rent numbers don&#039;t tell us a thing. We cannot form an opinion about rents on 37th avenue without doing a comparative analysis. According to the previous post, the former Greenpoint space on 37th Avenue is 300,000k for 3,400sf - which is about $88/sf a year (I&#039;m not sure given the information whether this includes basement space. If it does, the rent is less than $88/sf)<br /><br />Consider this - on some major commercial strips in Manhattan rents are almost $300/sf a year on average. The average for all of Manhattan, both major and minor corridors, was about $100/sf a year. See the attached article: http://www.huliq.com/2530/manhattan-retail-rents-continue-to-surge<br /><br />I also read another article where asking rents on Austin Street in Forest Hills (which supports a healthy mix of national and local retailers) is about $150/sf. Frankly, for some businesses $88/sf might be a good deal. The only thing that keeps a retailer from paying these rents is whether they make enough profit from customers to do so. Clearly, many of them can and do if they provide the right mix of goods, at the right price, with the right level of service. If they donâ€™t, they go out of business. Thatâ€™s not something that any of us can change with discussion on a listserve. Thatâ€™s economics. <br /><br />I should add that the one thing that may skew these rents is money laundering and drug dealing. Getting police involved may be necessary to ensure that these illegal activities do not cause average rents to rise. Legitimate businesses cannot compete against illegal businesses, and they shouldnâ€™t have to. <br />

				Smok, your post makes a lot of sense from an economic standpoint, thereby leading me to believe that several of the businesses located along 37th Avenue may be dubious in nature.&nbsp; One perfect example of this is the beauty product shop located in the low 80s that occupies a rather large space on 37th.&nbsp; The shop always seems empty, yet it continues to open its doors every day.&nbsp; I concede that it may have a few customers on a daily basis, but certainly not enough to successfully sustain a business of its size for the length of time that the shop has been in business.<br /><br />

				As noted earlier, another important factor is that today&#039;s asking rents may be quite different from the rents that existing businesses are paying.&nbsp; An established business may have a lease with a rent low enough to survive despite low sales.

				I was just reading this article from the Real Deal from this past September, and it sounds like the commercial rents in Park Slope - even the most expensive parts -- are only as high as $60 to $65 per square foot.&nbsp; Admittedly I don&#039;t know much about starting a business, but common sense would tell me that if I could have a space in Jackson Heights for $88/sq foot versus $60 in Park Slope, I would open in Park Slope unless my business served a certain local population (like the Indian groceries and Columbian clothing stores would clearly not do as well in Park Slope as they do in JH).<br /><br />http://beta.therealdeal.com/articles/5617<br /><br />&quot;Lawrence Sarn, director of sales for Massey Knakal, specializing in the South Slope and Windsor Terrace, said commercial rents along Fifth Avenue start at about $35 a square foot near Sunset Park to the south and run to $50 near 15th Street. Commercial rents along Seventh Avenue in this area are about $60 to 65 a square foot.<br /><br />Neil Dolgin, executive vice president of Kalmon Dolgin Affiliates, calculated commercial rents slightly higher. He&#039;s seeing $55 to $60 a square foot on Fifth Avenue and $60 to $75 on Seventh, compared to $25 to $35 a few years ago. Stores are about 1,000 to 2,000 square feet, though corner stores are often larger.<br /><br />&quot;There is still a bit of hesitance on the Fifth Avenue corridor to go too far south, but surprisingly new businesses are popping up,&quot; said Walston Bobb-Semple, Jr., principal broker at Urban View Realty in Park Slope. &quot;We rented a space recently on Fifth Avenue at 15th Street that will house a new Bikram Yoga studio. The rent was in the $4,000-per-month range.&quot;<br />

				Todd, I&#039;m almost sure that the beauty shop I refer to in my previous post has been in business for less than 5 years in the neighborhood.&nbsp; They may have entered into a long-term lease, but I have to question whether the rents on commercial spaces on 37th Avenue have substantially increased within the past 5 years.&nbsp; Unlike a verifiable business like Newman Jewelers that has been in existence for the past 30 years and may be&nbsp; renting under a long-term lease, the beauty products shop simply has not been around long enough to have witnessed significantly lower rents.

				&quot;What we really need here is commercial rent regulation so that the little guy still stays in business. Remember...greed is one of the seven deadly sins&quot;<br /><br />Having government (especially the inept New York City council) step in and mandate a commercial rent regulation would be the worst possible thing anyone could do.&nbsp; The end result would be that landlords would simply stop renting to businesses, since government would set rents so low that landlords wouldn&#039;t be able to make any money.&nbsp; Witness the shortage in housing in New York due to rent control laws.&nbsp; <br /><br />Price controls didn&#039;t work in the old Soviet Union, they don&#039;t work in Cuba nor North Korea, and they won&#039;t work in New York City either.&nbsp; Even the North Koreans know this, as they have relaxed price controls recently and allowed limited free markets to operate.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in favor of commercial rent regulations, maybe a move to Cuba or North Korea might be in order.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that North Korean winters are simply marvelous, and according to Michael Moore, Cuba is at the forefront of all the latest medical developments, not those evil capitalist companies such as Pfizer and Bristol Myers!&nbsp; <br /><br />As for greed being one of the seven deadly sins, I&#039;ll allow Gordon Gecko the last word on that:<br /><br />&quot;The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that: Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right; greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms, greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge â€” has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed, you mark my words â€” will not only save Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA.&quot; <br />

				It&#039;s an interesting phenomenon that landlords will keep raising the rent until the tenant can&#039;t afford to pay. Here&#039;s why: the landlords (real estate speculation companies) are taking out loans against the value of their property. The only way the lenders can assess the value of the property is by looking at what is the current rent. Landlords, just like homeowners, are looking to extract the value of their property so that they can invest in other things, such as more properties to jack up the rent on.<br />In my old neighborhood, this happened about ten years ago, and virtually all of the small businesses were replaced by banks and starbucks. That&#039;s why I moved here. For some reason, banks are willing to pay the high rents. As a result, we will soon have very good access to our money, but nothing to spend it on because all of the little restaurants and shops will be gone!<br />The only thing we can do to stop this is to not patronize banks. Put all your money into an online bank that has no retail outlets, such as ING Direct. Also, when you buy coffee, try to find the little bakeries that sell it for less than a dollar, because a successful starbucks may spawn two or three more.<br />Mike

				Here&#039;s a recent article from Crain&#039;s New York Business about hard times on 74th Street...<br /><br />Crain&#039;s New York Business<br />January 14, 2008<br />Enduring popularity might be Little India&#039;s undoing;<br />Established retailers pinched by rents in Jackson Heights commercial district<br />BY: Doaa Elkady<br /><br />Thirty-five years ago, Subhash Kapadia opened the Sam and Raj appliance store on 74th Street in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Mr. Kapadia&#039;s business catered to Indians looking for small appliances that ran on 220 volts that they could take back to their native country. The only shop of its kind in the neighborhood, Sam and Raj was a hit almost immediately. Mr. Kapadia&#039;s accomplishment inspired other Indian-Americans to set up businesses in Jackson Heights; within 10 years, 74th Street was home to a number of Indian-owned eateries, clothing stores and an Indian grocery.<br /><br />``That&#039;s how Little India was born,&#039;&#039; Mr. Kapadia says.<br /><br />The Jackson Heights retail center is still one of the most well-known ethnic shopping strips in New York. But like other popular retail areas in the city, it is becoming a victim of its own success. Competitors are rushing in, driving up rents and displacing longtime merchants like Mr. Kapadia.<br /><br />Now, the Little India that Mr. Kapadia helped build includes more than 250 businesses, according to the Jackson Heights Merchants Association. Visitors are inundated with the flash of colorful saris, the glitter of Indian jewelry and the robust smells of South Asian cooking. The streets are never empty. Parking is difficult. Stores are open late.<br /><br />The strip&#039;s popularity and reputation have made Jackson Heights one of the choice locations for Indian-Americans to live and do business. But that has proved a double-edged sword for Little India&#039;s merchants, who have benefited from the phenomenon but who now face competitive pressures.<br /><br />``For decades, business was so good we didn&#039;t know what to do,&#039;&#039; Mr. Kapadia says. ``But today, many of the businesses are struggling to stay open.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Declining demand<br /><br />Mr. Kapadia has suffered from increased competition, higher rents and declining demand among Indian-Americans for 220-volt appliances. ``It is a different age,&#039;&#039; he says. ``Most of what I sell is available in India now.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Last year, Mr. Kapadia was forced to move into a 1,330-square-foot store from 2,300 square feet.<br /><br />Across the street from Mr. Kapadia&#039;s store, Rajbhog Sweets is also hurting. Owner Nirval Shah&#039;s family opened the dessert shop in 1977.<br /><br />``Business has been down since 9/11, but the pressure really began two years ago,&#039;&#039; Mr. Shah says. Profits fell 10% in both 2005 and 2006. He blames the downturn in part on a 50% jump in ingredient costs.<br /><br />``Rents have always increased, but now we can&#039;t keep up with them,&#039;&#039; Mr. Shah says. ``You can&#039;t charge customers more just because it&#039;s more expensive to make food. This puts us at a loss.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />In the last five years, Mr. Shah has watched 15 to 20 eateries close; some of them had been in Little India for as long as 20 years. ``If things don&#039;t change, we may have to downsize or shut down,&#039;&#039; he says.<br /><br />Niche is better<br /><br />Some merchants, like Harshad Patel, manager of Patel Brothers grocery, say landlords are turning a blind eye to their plight.<br /><br />``I pay $35,000 a month in rent,&#039;&#039; Mr. Patel says. ``I tell my landlord, `Profit is down; costs are up,&#039; but he says, `It&#039;s not my business.&#039; &#039;&#039;<br /><br />Not everyone is complaining, though. Niche retailers face less competition. Armaan Kumar, who sells traditional Indian wedding apparel at Armaan&#039;s Bridal, says serving a limited market helps him remain profitable.<br /><br />``People will never stop getting married,&#039;&#039; Mr. Kumar says. ``When the economy&#039;s down, you have to be smart about what you&#039;re selling.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />There&#039;s no evidence that the district is in jeopardy, says Swain Weiner, senior director of sales at Massey Knakal Realty Services.<br /><br />``Retailers are facing difficulties, but Little India has suffered less than places in Elmhurst or Corona,&#039;&#039; Mr. Weiner says. ``There are no vacant stores. If a space opens up, lots of people bid on it. Turnover is very small. That says things are still healthy.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />That&#039;s little consolation to struggling business owners, who are now seeking rent protection. The City Council last introduced a commercial rent control bill in 1987. It fell one vote short of passing because of fears that it would discourage economic growth. Efforts to revive interest in such a law have been unsuccessful so far.<br />

				Hi Brian, as the person who originally posted this topic, I just wanted to say that this thread is about the high cost of commercial rent in the neighborhood (and especially on 37th Avenue), not about the keeping the streets clean on 74th St.&nbsp; It would be great if we could keep this thread on topic so it&#039;s easier to follow.&nbsp; I know you have brought up the issue of street conditions on 74th St in other threads, so perhaps you could add to those other already existing threads if you have more to say on that issue.

				While commercial rents in the historic district may be high, they&#039;re not necessarily as high in surrounding areas.&nbsp; We&#039;re seeing a lot of new and innovative businesses open up on Roosevelt (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=382.0), Broadway (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=347.0), the Waldbaum&#039;s Plaza (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=180.0), and Northern Blvd (http://search.cityguide.aol.com/newyork/restaurants/jardi/v-304870).&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps we should be looking to these types of less charismatic, less expensive, and less central commercial strips for future innovation.&nbsp; At least that&#039;s the argument made in a recent post on this topic over at Queens Central Blog: Why we need the hideous mini-mall (http://www.queenscentral.com/2008/01/27/why-we-need-the-hideous-mini-mall/).&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a thought.

				The commercial rents may be getting too high in prime Park Slope, too, according to this http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2008/01/second-street-cafe-closing-followup.html<br /><br />Some of the blog posters are predicting that there will be more spillover from 7th Ave to 5th Ave and to areas like Prospect Heights, where commercial rents are cheaper than the prime 7th Ave in Park Slope.

				I saw a &quot;for rent&quot; sign up in a storefront on the north-side of 37th Avenue between 80th &amp; 81st. I called the number and spoke with the broker. She told me that the space was already leased to a bakery. <br /><br />I asked her, out of curiosity, what the space rented for. She quoted the rent at $4,200 per month. I am not sure about the exact square footage of the space, but it is comparable to its neighbor Yogurberry. I guess that gives us some idea of what commercial rent is on 37th Avenue right now.&nbsp;

				The rise in real estate costs and general operating expenses have negatively impacted larger businesses like supermarkets, Met Foods on 37th Avenue included.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s a telling excerpt from an article from The Queens Courier:<br /><br /><strong>The Queens Courier</strong><br />Struggling supermarkets seek support (http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2009/04/15/news/top_stories/doc49e62b666ac8f957247129.txt)<br />BY CLAUDIA CRUZ<br />Wednesday, April 15, 2009 4:26 PM EDT<br /><br /><em>Jason Ferreira, a manager at the Met Foodmarkets at 76-10 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights, doesnâ€™t want to get priced out either. His family has leased their commercial space for the last 13 years and though he has a good relationship with their landlord â€“ he wonâ€™t reveal his lease terms â€“ Ferreira said that he has seen rents almost triple since the 1990s.<br /><br />â€œIn the 1990s in Queens, the average square foot ranged between $8 and $12. Nowadays it can range from $24 to $50 per square foot,â€ said Ferreira. â€œNo matter how good business is for me, I canâ€™t pay an unrealistic rent.â€<br /><br />Since the supermarket opened in 1996, Ferreira has noticed that, instead of growing, his profit margin has shrunk. From 1996 until 2008, the yearly insurance rate increased from $20,000 to almost $70,000, taxes have gone up 20 to 30 percent and electricity bolted from 6 cents to 18 cents a kilowatt hour.<br /><br />To stay competitive, however, Ferreira must keep food reasonably priced.<br /><br />â€œYou used to make $1 profit for a sale of a $4.99 [sack of rice], but now you sell at $9.99 and still only make $1 off the sack of rice because you need to remain competitive,â€ said Ferreira. â€œThe percentage of what you make is less now.â€</em><br /><br /><strong><em>[Click on above link for complete article.]</em></strong>

				<strong>37Th Ave, Roosevelt Ave, side streets...You name it, the rents are horrendous.&nbsp; The smaller shops are even worse.&nbsp; I have been searching for a small store front in high population density areas.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care if it was Jackson Heights, Forest Hills, Rego Park and even Corona or Kew Gardens.&nbsp; Since I am planing on branching into resales and short sales soon (I exclusively sell sponsor owned units at this time) and I will be hiring a trainee once I locate a reasonably priced shop.&nbsp; The prices for store fronts are ridiculous in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I see tons of desk for rents and tiny 100 to 150 sq feet office within other offices being rented for $600 to $1500 per month.&nbsp; Business are sharing spaces, renting desks and there are plenty of offices available but the landlords wont budge.<br /><br /><br />Now that the market is down Real Estate are closing their big fancy &quot;over the top&quot; offices and are rethinking their overhead approach.&nbsp; I know a couple of attorneys doing the same as well as a ton of house builders.&nbsp; The only way rents will go down will be when vacancies don&#039;t get filled.&nbsp; LIC and Astoria are a prime example of this.&nbsp; Some of the least expensive square feet can be found in those places.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be fooled by the two main strips in Astoria...look it up.

				Madalyn,<br /><br />Perhaps money laundering <em>is</em> a big problem in the area. Certainly many people on this forum have speculated as much. And perhaps it&#039;s for this reason that so few &quot;really fine eating establishments&quot; have opened in the area. But then are we to believe that money laundering is unique to Jackson Heights? Why don&#039;t Astoria, Sunnyside, and Forest Hills, which all boast equally exorbitant commercial rents, seem to suffer from this problem?<br /><br />If it&#039;s true that many of the businesses in the area are fronts, then an investigation is demanded. But I have another theory. I suspect that the lack of trendier restaurants in JH reflects the neighborhood&#039;s lack of trendier, i.e., less affluent, upwardly-mobile, demographics in the area. This isn&#039;t to say there hasn&#039;t been an influx of professionals moving into the area. But Jackson Heights is a largely cooperative neighborhood, meaning long-time residents can&#039;t simply be priced out of their homes. And these long-time residents might like their Columbian and Mexican and south-east Asian restaurants. Enough, perhaps, to keep them operating legitimately.<br /><br />Or is there concrete evidence of serious mischief?<br />

				I disagree with the demographics theory.&nbsp; All types of people from all social strata recognize and patronize establishments that serve delicious, high quality food.&nbsp; Have you been to Cannelle Patisserie?&nbsp; There is definitely a market here for good quality eating and shopping establishments.&nbsp; If I had venture capital, I would be the first one to open a place and prove my point.<br /><br />Over the years, I have been doing my own little investigation about businesses around here.&nbsp; I am not going to name any particular establishments because I have no proof, but I see several businesses, even right outside my window, that hardly have any customers - ever - and whose proprietors don&#039;t seem much interested in increasing the prospects of improving traffic into their little stores.&nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re not difficult to find, you just have to pay attention. <br /><br />Now why this problem should be more prevalent here in Jackson Heights is the great mystery that many of us are wondering about.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not denying the possibility of widespread money laundering by proprietors and landlords in the area. And I am the first one to argue against the idea that only affluent whites benefit and appreciate fine fare, bookstores, and well-stitched garments. I was only coming up with a theory as to why certain restaurants can keep from shuttering when it would seem unfathomable in any other neighborhood.

				a book store would be awesome. <br /><br />as far as the rest, try to take an honest look around. when you eliminate 90 percent of the neighbors as potential clients, it&#039;s hard to make a living off half of the remaining 10 percent. i doubt that many south indian families, latin teenagers, eastern european ladies or elderly new yorkers would spend much time in a trendy wine and cheese bar.<br /><br />this board is not representative of jackson heights. i have lived here for 15 years and while i would go to one of those from time to time, the vast -- VAST -- majority of my friends in the neighborhood would not and the rent, as we discussed here, is so so high that trying to do so on a major thoroughfare would make it silly to sink big bucks into one.<br /><br />i lived in greenpoint in the mid 80s and saw attempts to get all fancy and -- in the vernacular of the time -- yuppie fail miserably. same thing in ditmas park circa 1989. the thing that&#039;s different here is that jackson hts is solidly middle class and the residents cannot be thrown out as easily as they were in those neighborhoods, making it harder to homogenize it into some sort of little piece of a monochromatic nyc where everyone is the same.<br /><br />sorry to go off, but it really strikes me that so so so so so many people move into this neighborhood for what it is, then set about trying to make it what it is not --- namely the neighborhood they just got priced out of by habitues of trendy wine and cheese bars.

				I know man..I know!&nbsp; You made a great point.&nbsp; However, that&#039;s just my wish list.&nbsp; <br />I lived here on and off for the past 30 years and saw all sorts of changes. I just moverd back two years ago and I guess my hopes would be that one day I would see less JUNKY stores and more QUALITY stores. A book store would be fantastic! Maybe a Strands&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Thanks for the reply - Have a great day!<br /><br />AN

				Part of the problem is that the buildings are owned by different owners and therefore they are trying to maximize tenant/rent for one space at a time.<br /><br />At a good retail mall the management understands you need a mix of tenants you can&#039;t have five jewelry stores and therefore the mall will offer lower rents to attract book stores and other lower margin retailers.<br /><br />Look at 82nd Street today we have lost retail balance we have to many banks but as a owner I would want a bank tenant because they have good credit and sign long term leases.

				&nbsp;Alot of these landlords lease month to month w/o contract, allowing the tenant to &quot;renovate&quot; the space for them for free, then jack the rent up after a few months when the tenant has invested so much time and money.&nbsp; The tenant tries to hold on as long as they can, they get kicked out and the landlord finds their next mark.&nbsp; It&#039;s a dirty little game.

				Why do we view landlords as &quot;dirty&quot;?<br /><br />They buy commercial real estate to make money, just like buying stocks or bonds.<br />A lot of real estate is owned by families that are good members of community and are willing to give back (like the Rudin Family http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bill+Rudin+to+speak+on+long-term+real+estate+investing.%28Brief+Article%29-a062026986) <br /><br />Normally retail leases are for 10 years a month to month lease normally is just interim use of the space until a better tenant comes along.&nbsp;

				because we tend to generalize. <br /><br />the vast majority of landlords are fine people and treat their tenants well. a few are so insanely over the top evil that they cast a huge shadow.<br /><br />it&#039;s like any other group that someone can find a reason to demonize (usually incorrectly). ethnic minorities, lawyers, the homeless, those with different sexual orientations. <br /><br />sad but true.

				I was wondering if the city had ever tried to control commercial rents in order to prevent these kinds of situations where there is plenty of retail space in a neighborhood but the rents are so high that potential business owners can&#039;t afford to take the risk.<br /><br />I googled and found out that there was recently a proposal for this kind of commercial rent control, but it failed. <br /><br />http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/commercial-rent-control-bill-introduced-by-council-member-robert-jackson-stalls-in-city-council

				of course they can do whatever they want. and so can we. as in refusing to patronize the new establishments and returning the storefronts to their vacant status. i like empty storefronts just fine if they mean a usurious landlord is squirming and suffering.

				I think we have to distinguish between greedy landlord who suddenly doubles the rent and the new tenant.&nbsp; The party that eventually rents the space is not at fault and boycotting their business to get back at the landlord does not accomplish that goal and doesn&#039;t really make sense.

				when i lived on the lower east side in the mid 80s, a beloved fixture restaurant called the orchidia was forced out by a greedy new landlord after about 50 years in the same location. we were horrified. it was replaced by an outpost of steve&#039;s ice cream -- a flash in the pan overpriced chain -- that agreed to pay eight times what the lovely old folks did. we boycotted steve&#039;s actively. it went out of business after six months. the landlord had an empty storefront for ages. it made sense to me then, and makes sense to me now. no offense intended towards your viewpoint.

				Yeah, let&#039;s look at this from the renters POV.&nbsp; Maybe he&#039;s a beloved renter of a bigger place elsewhere who had his/her own following who had to downsize andw as lucky to get one of the neighborhood vacated spots.<br /><br />Like the people we will miss from M&amp;V, Flagship, the Cavalier, and the many stores before them going back years (Luigi&#039;s, Budd&#039;s, Discount Books, etc.) all have the right to rent without being discriminated against because of their landlord.<br /><br />Besides if a small business is bankrupted, that person is hurt more than the landlord.&nbsp; Heck the landlord may even benefit .. he gets his money, even if he uses collection agencies, right.<br /><br />That all said, I don&#039;t really know what can be done to stop greedy landlords ... this is why I don&#039;t work corporate I guess ..
