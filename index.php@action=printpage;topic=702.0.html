				I&#039;m wondering if any of you who are runners or joggers have figured out a local route that doesn&#039;t require stopping at every block to watch for traffic.&nbsp; To avoid traffic, I run in Central Park which is always amazing, but it&#039;s so time consuming getting there and back I&#039;m unable to run nearly as much as I&#039;d like to.&nbsp; Any suggestions for routes that start in Jackson Heights, don&#039;t entail getting on a subway, and allow for a non-stop run?&nbsp; My ideal run for now is about 6 miles.

				what about Flushing Meadow Park?&nbsp; It&#039;s huge, closed to cars. You can run around the lake etc.&nbsp; You just have to run to 111th to get into the park.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a car person, there&#039;s a great path along the water in Bayside.&nbsp; Not sure but I think it&#039;s about 4 miles in each direction from end to end.

				Thanks!&nbsp; I have no car...but I like the Flushing Meadows Park idea, if it really just entails running up to 111th St that seems quite feasible.&nbsp; I&#039;ll take a look at a map.&nbsp; I&#039;m grateful for the suggestion, as if this works it will make a huge difference for me.

				there&#039;s a running/bike path on 34th Ave.&nbsp; u&#039;ll still have to occasionally stop at intersections but at least there&#039;s a path designated.&nbsp; Turn right on 111th and after crossing Roosevelt Ave. you&#039;ll see the entrance to the park thru a parking lot in a couple more blocks. sorry I don&#039;t remember the exact street but you can&#039;t miss it.&nbsp; once u go thru the parking lot into the park, it&#039;s huge and gorgeous.&nbsp; Beats going into the city for a change.

				I just started running in the neighborhood as well, and I am up to about 6 miles. I have looked into running in both Flushing Meadow and in the opposite direction to Astoria Park.&nbsp; From 82nd street and 35th av it is just under 3 miles to both parks according to google maps.&nbsp; As I extend my mileage I am hoping both parks with provide a nice retreat from the streets.&nbsp; Flushing meadow has the lake and Astoria park, though smaller, has the river and a track.&nbsp;

				I try to start my run at 6 a.m. The streets are almost deserted at that time and I rarely have to stop. And on the occasion when I do have to wait for traffic, it is generally one to two cars. The parks are just not convenient for me as part of my regular run.

				Since I was at Astoria Park today for the first time in ages, I wanted to add that although Flushing Meadow is so much bigger and a bit closer to JHs, the path along the water by Astoria Park is empty and seems great.&nbsp; You just have to get to the park from here.&nbsp; I think Astoria Park is about 3 1/2 miles away (def. not under 3 miles) although Flushing Meadows may be a little under 3 miles away. So I kinda agree with JD since just running round trip is already your six miles.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know bus schedules at all but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a bus along Ditmars that would go to Astoria Park. I used to ride a bike so getting to and from the park was a different experience than running.

				I just went for a run up 30th and 31st Avenues towards 100th Street. It&#039;s very peaceful over there with not too many cars and much less exhaust to inhale than on 34th Avenue. Also, there is a handy web site I use to track my mileage: www.runningmap.com

				I&#039;d recommend 34th to Flushing Meadows and go around the water. Astoria park also has a track if you don&#039;t mind laps but if you&#039;re taking the subway I&#039;d probably opt for Central Park.<br /><br />Has anyone been running or bicycling in the parks east of Flushing Meadow?

				The only other place I&#039;ve biked, roller bladed or jogged was along the water in Bayside and the board walks in Long Beach Island and Jones Beach.&nbsp; As far as parks go, I&#039;ve always gone to either Central Park or Flushing Meadow.&nbsp; After living in Queens for about 25 years, I just went to Astoria Park for the first time!&nbsp; I&#039;m a creature of habit, I guess.&nbsp; Wait, I just remembered the bike path along the water from Chelsea to Battery Park.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done that, too. I&#039;ve never done it up on the North end which I guess would go along side Riverside Drive. I am curious about the other parks.

				<br />I have had pretty good luck on 32nd ave. where there are mostly stop signs and not traffic lights, so every car has to stop at the intersection.&nbsp; I find 34th to be too much start and stop.&nbsp; I&#039;m only doing 3 miles though.<br /><br />Also great biking to flushing meadow and it gets even better when you ride all the way to Alley Pond park on almost all car free bike trails.

				Hey Lex, <br />do you mean biking is good on 32nd Ave too? <br />I moved here from Prospect Heights in Brooklyn, near the park, so running here compared to that totally sucks. <br />I agree that there is too much stop and start on 34th Ave. Also, too much exhaust from the cars.

				Hello all,<br /><br />I enjoy recreational running and occasionally like joining road races every now and then. Since I just moved here, does anyone else here also run? If you do, please give me some suggestions for some nice running routes. I usually cover like 4-6 miles each time and don&#039;t mind any uphills or sharp turns or surfaces.<br /><br />Thanks

				I&#039;m not sure where your starting point is, but I&#039;ve found that the streets north of Northern Blvd (particularly on or around 30th Ave and 25th Ave) in East Elmhurst are pretty convenient for running, given the tree cover and relative lack of traffic. As an added bonus, on hot days you can run through the frog sprinklers in Gorman Park on 30th Ave and 84th St if there aren&#039;t too many kids around.<br /><br />I also like to head down the 34th Ave bike lane and follow it through Woodside and Sunnyside over the Queensboro bridge, finishing at Lexington and 63rd and taking the F train back home. The run works out to be between 5 and 5.5 miles, depending on where your starting point is in JH.

				I&#039;ll second that - the streets north of northern are great for running - very little auto or pedestrian traffic most of the time. (Just make sure you keep running past the patisserie, not into it)<br /><br />I usually like to finish my run with a cool-down walk along 35th avenue - the red brick and green gardens always makes me feel relaxed at the end of a run.

				My short route is as follows: Start in front of 35-35 75th Street (home); go North to 35th Avenue; turn left; go straight (and downhill - a most desirable start) until you pass under the BQE. Turn left and go up the hill, cross Broadway and continue a few blocks until you pass Roosevelt, veering to the left at the V. Go up the hill and cross Woodside Avenue. Then go down the hill to Queens Boulevard. <br /><br />Turn left at Queens Boulevard. Run past the BQE exit, asserting pedestrian rights (i.e., let those cars know that we own the streets, it&#039;s OK to accidentally bump a car), but don&#039;t get killed. Continue East on Queens Boulevard going under the railroad overpass. At the next city street (don&#039;t go on the BQE) make a left. Go up the hill for a block and 1/2 noting the tiny park on the left - WITH A WATER FOUNTAIN. Stop for a drink. Before drinking, use your finger to partially block the exit nozzle and direct the water to give the small fern tree a spritz. Take a drink.<br /><br />Continue up the hill and across the street - crossing Woodside Avenue here is the most dangerous crossing - and running through the small park at Woodside and 69th Street. Continue North on 69th for one block, making a right at the next corner. Continue for a block or three and make a left to Roosevelt. Let the traffic guide you across Roosevelt and through Little India. Stop running on 73rd Street 1/2 block North of 37th Road and take in the world.<br /><br />Takes me about 25 minutes. &nbsp;Barely meets my minimum but the up and down requires some effort. <br /><br />

				I usually go from my home on 35th down to 70th street, take a right and go up to 31st street. Right again to 100th street. Right again to 34th or 35th and head home through the historic district. That&#039;s about 4 miles. To add more miles...it&#039;s almost a perfect mile to go from 35th ave to 31st avenue and back...so add as many zigzags as you need for more miles. <br /><br />Map route: here (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=40.750703,-73.893957&amp;daddr=70th+St+to:70th+St+to:31st+Ave+to:31st+Ave+to:31st+Ave+to:100th+St+to:34th+Ave+to:35th+Ave&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3BFW7PbQIdLHCY-w%3BFUzfbQIdQm2Y-w%3BFUrrbQIdL2yY-w%3BFfXybQIdRrWY-w%3BFZ_2bQId8deY-w%3BFcnibQIdP9yY-w%3BFYrdbQIdTLuY-w%3BFfLObQIdiHiY-w&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=0&amp;sz=15&amp;via=1,2,3,4,5,6,7&amp;dirflg=w&amp;sll=40.754474,-73.883872&amp;sspn=0.024837,0.039697&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=15)

				Wow thanks for all the suggestions. I never knew there was a bike path that led to Manhattan until I got the responses to this post.<br /><br />With all the runners that seem to live in or around here, is there a running specialty shops in Jackson Heights or nearby? Footlocker and Athletes Foot does not count as running specialty stores.<br /><br />Oh and if anyone wants to know, I have a pleasant 4 mile course that begins on 90th St. Elmhurst Ave/Roosevelt Ave and goes up till Broadway, then make a left turn on Queens Blvd and you continue along Queens Blvd till you turn on 63rd Dr and hit Junction Blvd. Turn on Junction Blvd and go down Junction Blvd till it connects to Roosevelt Avenue again and follow Roosevelt back to 90th St. This is nice and hilly route.
