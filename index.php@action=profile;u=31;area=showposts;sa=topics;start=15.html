The heating system malfunctions in the winter, forcing students to sit through lessons wearing coats, scarves and hats.<br /><br />In the main building at P.S. 19, there are monitors to keep order in the lines that form outside the bathrooms, and studentsâ€™ trips are timed. The wait can be too long for some of the younger students.<br /><br />Lourdes Castillo said her 6-year-old son came home at least once every week with his pants wet. Bertha Trix said her 5-year-old daughter told her she had to choose between eating or using the bathroom during lunchtime because there was no time for both.<br /><br />â€œOn most days,â€ Ms. Trix said, â€œshe comes home hungry.â€<br /><br />Parents in well-to-do neighborhoods of Manhattan and in Park Slope, Brooklyn, have become accustomed to kindergarten waiting lists and congested classrooms, problems that may become worse if the city carries out its proposal to lay off 4,100 teachers. But nowhere in the city has crowding been as acute and as intractable as in Corona.<br /><br />As immigrant families have flooded into Corona in recent years, their children have poured into the neighborhoodâ€™s schools. Crowding has been an issue for at least two decades, but it has become especially severe since 2005; in District 24, which encompasses Corona and six other neighborhoods in western Queens, student enrollment has gone up 12 percent in that time, while citywide, it has remained flat.<br /><br />Continue reading at:<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/nyregion/in-corona-queens-a-legacy-of-crowded-schools.html?hp" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/nyregion/in-corona-queens-a-legacy-of-crowded-schools.html?hp</a>

					<strong>NY1 Story:</strong><br /><a href="http://ny1.com/ 8-queens- news-content/ top_stories/ 110596/queens- station-prime- for-retail- -leaders- say?ap=1&amp;Flash" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://ny1.com/ 8-queens- news-content/ top_stories/ 110596/queens- station-prime- for-retail- -leaders- say?ap=1&amp;Flash</a><br /><br />JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY, December 16, 2009 -- Despite the city&#039;s economic crisis, the MTA has failed to lease valuable commercial space at the 74th Street/Roosevelt Avenue station in Jackson Heights, Queens. After the station was renovated with millions of dollars of taxpayer money, the MTA has missed out on significant income by not leasing these properties.<br /><br />Yet the MTA is currently trying to close a nearly $400 million budget gap by planning dramatic cuts to bus and subway service. Also on the chopping block are the free MetroCards that half a million of New York Cityâ€™s students use to get to school. City Council Member-elect Daniel Dromm along with Assemblyman Jose Peralta, Assemblyman Michael DenDekker and many community leaders, demanded that the MTA pursue leasing these commercial properties to generate revenue to prevent drastic service cuts at a press conference held in front of the Roosevelt Avenue station.<br /><br />â€œIt is absolutely shameful that the MTA is considering throwing students under the bus before pursuing revenue from these valuable propertiesâ€ said City Council Member-elect Daniel Dromm. &quot;The MTA has neglected the Jackson Heights community by failing to lease these properties. The MTA must focus on all revenue opportunities before they talk about any service cuts or massive fare increases for students.&quot;<br /><br />â€œThe MTA needs to review their operational policy every time they feel they need to make cuts, because it is not working. If itâ€™s not the hard working men and women of this State that is usually affected, then it is our senior population. Now, they turn their darts on our students, making it much more difficult for them to get to and from school,â€ stated Assemblyman Jose R. Peralta. â€œThe MTA needs to look deep into their reserve fund and find appropriate sources of funding. The funding situation turns even more confusing when suitable funding sources -like the ones at the 74 Street Station- are available yet they are not included in the financial equation.â€<br /><br />Assemblyman Michael DenDekker said, &quot;Before the MTA starts to implement any service cuts at all, it should check all available financial resources such as the leasing of MTA property and all other revenue sources they have.&quot;<br /><br />The impact of these abandoned-looking storefronts on the community is also a main concern. These vacant storefronts have been a blight to the neighborhood with a boarded-up streetscape that promotes vandalism, graffiti, crime, and sanitation problems. The MTA&#039;s failure to maintain this property has negatively impacted the surrounding small businesses and residential community.<br /><br />Meanwhile, transit hubs like the Fulton Street station are anything but neglected. According to the New York Times, the Fulton Street station enjoys 20,000 square feet of retail space after its recent renovation, and is reported to command about $150 a square foot annually. Why the MTA hasnâ€™t been able to take advantage of its own commercial space at Roosevelt Ave station isnâ€™t exactly clear.<br /><br />Located at 74th Street, Broadway, and Roosevelt Ave in Jackson Heights, Queens, the transit hub benefited from a $132 million renovation in 2005. The main objective of the overhaul was to ease movement within the facility, one of the few in the system that allows transfers between an underground stop and an elevated line. As one of the only dual bus and subway stations in the city, it is the second busiest in Queens, with over 42,000 people using the station daily.

In children, lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain damage and <br />can impair mental functioning. It can retard mental and physical development and <br />reduce attention span. It can also retard fetal development even at extremely low <br />levels of lead. In adults, it can cause irritability, poor muscle coordination, and nerve <br />damage to the sense organs and nerves controlling the body. Lead poisoning may <br />also cause problems with reproduction (such as a decreased sperm count). It may <br />also increase blood pressure. Thus, young children, fetuses, infants, and adults <br />with high blood pressure are the most vulnerable to the effects of lead. <br /><em><br />Learn more at the Dept of Health website</em>: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/lead/lead.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/lead/lead.shtml</a><br /><br /><em>Also here is a link to a Lead Test Kit for Households</em>. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.leadcheck.com/LeadCheckSwabHU.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.leadcheck.com/LeadCheckSwabHU.shtml</a><br /><br /><br />

					<strong><em>If you are concerned about</em>:<br />- Walking across Roosevelt Ave safely<br />- Traffic Congestion on 37th Avenue and side streets<br />- Noise from idling trucks<br />- Speeding cars on residential streets<br />- Slow buses<br />- Pollution from trucks and airplanes<br />- Horn honking !!!<br />- and many other transportation-related concerns<br /><br />You can do something about it.<br /></strong><br />I wanted everyone to know about a very important community workshop<br />coming up that will have a huge impact on transportation in Jackson Heights .<br />The Dept of Transportation is beginning a major $1.5 million study of<br />transportation in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />The first phase of the study will focus on the area of east-west<br />(69th Street-82nd Street) and north-south (Northern Blvd- Broadway).<br />A key focus of the study is to improve pedestrian access<br />to the mass transit hub at 74th/Roosevelt.<br />The study will include the implementation of short-term and long-term<br />transportation solutions.<br /><br />The first Community Workshop for the study will be held on Thursday,<br />July 16th at 6:30pm at the White Castle Headquarters 69-01 34th Avenue<br />in Jackson Heights. Please attend. I think it is critical that we have the local<br />community participate in the discussion.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Mark your calendars</span>:<br /><strong>Thursday, July 16th 6:30pm</strong><br />Jackson Heights Neighborhood Transportation Study<br />Community Workshop<br />White Castle Headquarters<br /><strong>69-01 34th Avenue</strong>, Jackson Heights<br /><br />I hope to see you there.

Unidos pudimos!&#039;&quot; the statement read, referring to the Barack Obama-inspired name of the line on which Ferreras had decided to run in the nonpartisan special election.<br /><br />According to Alex Navarro-McKay, a former operative for the Working Families Party (a big Ferreras backer) who now works for BerlinRosen, which handled press for the campaign, Ferreras led her nearest competitor, Francisco Moya, by 1,034 votes with 92 percent of precincts reporting.<br /><br />Ferreras&#039; (unofficial) victory is historic. She&#039;s the first Latina to represent the borough on the Council. But it also marks the rise of what her ally, Assemblyman Jose Peralta, called &quot;the new Three Amigos.&quot;<br /><br />The victory of Ferreras - Monserrate&#039;s former chief of staff - with an assist from Peralta, a former ally of ex-Sen. John Sabini, the man Monserrate forced out of last year&#039;s Senate Democratic primary, is sure to send a frisson up the spine of the Queens Democratic establishment. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;This is an opportunity for the three of us to really send a message,&quot; Peralta said. &quot;It&#039;s a big victory not only for Latinos, but for all of Northern Queens; it&#039;s very positive for out community, which has been underrepresented for many years.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The new Three Amigos are coming together and setting a new agenda for Northern Queens,&quot; the assemblyman continued. &quot;...It&#039;s not a threat to anyone. Now we have more of a voice at the table, that&#039;s all we wanted.&quot;<br /><br />Peralta did suggest, however, that &quot;county&quot; should sit up and take notice.<br /><br />Officially speaking, the party organization remained neutral in this race. But, in Peralta&#039;s view, there was a tactic understanding that it was OK for people to back Moya, a former aide to Gov. David Paterson (in his Senate minority leader days).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;There was a lot of passion in this race; there was a lot of mudslinging and fear that didn&#039;t have to take place,&quot; Peralta said.<br /><br />During a brief phone interview from Ferreras&#039; victory party, Monserrate, who has a long history of making trouble for the party and its chairman, rep. Joe Crowley, refused to discuss whether the organization should see this new threesome as a threat.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;This is a very good thing for the borough of Queens, and we did it at the grassroots level,&quot; said Monserrate. &quot;It&#039;s a beautiful day...Jose Peralta is my brother, and he is my ally, and he is part of what we did and what we put together to make history in the borough. The Latino leadership in this borough is unified.&quot;<br /><br />When pressed on whether the Queens Democratic Party should consider him worrisome, Monserrate replied: &quot;That&#039;s a question I guess you should ask them; we want to work with everybody.&quot;<br /><br />Then Ferreras got on the phone and praised the Working Families Party for doing an &quot;incredible job,&quot; and adding: &quot;I have to work with those who stood with me; I&#039;m honored to do that. I can&#039;t really tell you what else it means right now.&quot;

I don&#039;t have the time to keep the neighborhood clean.&#039; &quot;<br /><br />Suparna Chakrabortti, who lives in Queens but visits her family on West End Avenue almost every day, says the Upper West Side has gone to the dogs.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s on every block every day,&quot; she said. &quot;In the past couple months, it&#039;s gotten much worse. I don&#039;t remember it being this bad.&quot;<br /><br />While those Upper West Side streets have the highest concentration of complaints in Manhattan, the prize for the crappiest borough goes to The Bronx, which with 354 violations accounts for over a third of the summonses issued citywide, the Sanitation Department said. The two worst locations are on Mosholu Parkway and Hunts Point Avenue.<br /><br />Brooklyn pet owners, who live in the second-worst borough for doggy doo, have been slapped with 224 fines in 2008, up 47 percent from the year before. Sunset Park, Park Slope and Brownsville are the three top Fido-fouled areas.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Watch your step in Jackson Heights - it topped the list twice in the top three worst dog-dung locations in Queens, which was nipped with 168 violations in 2008.</span></strong> Trendy Queens neighborhood Astoria also topped the list.<br /><br />Staten Island residents were up to their neck in doggy doo - hit with a 120 percent increase in the number of fines issued, from 24 in 2007 to 53 last year.<br /><br />The Department of Sanitation hopes to combat inconsiderate pet owners after raising the fine from $50 to $250 this past November.<br /><br />Sanitation officers issued 909 pooper-scooper violations citywide from July 2007 to June 2008, up 16 percent from 783 for the same period the previous year.<br />

					An article in the New York Times about one man&#039;s quest to get a broken streetlight fixed <br />reminded me of how frustrating calling 311 can be. <br />I wonder if there is support to start an effort here on JHLife to track 311 complaints. <br />A simple log of 311 calls which would include basic information like:<br /><br /><strong>Time/Date of Call<br />Subject of Call<br />Tracking Number from 311 Operator<br />Date of Response or Resolution of Problem</strong><br /><br />What does everyone think? <br />This might be a way for us all to become aware of how responsive city agencies are to neighborhood problems <br />and also it will chronicle which issues and concerns are important to people on this site. <br /><br /><em>Here is a link to the New York Times article</em>:<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/nyregion/07light.html?hp" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/nyregion/07light.html?hp</a><br /><br /><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/02/07/nyregion/07light.xlarge1.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
