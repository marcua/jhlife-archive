				Last night at seven PM, our neighborhood trumpet player started his pandemic playlist, as he&#039;s done every night since the celebration/thank you thing has been going on. for the first time, a hate-filled person started yelling at him to stop because &quot;i want peace and quiet.&quot; <br /><br />the horn dude let him go on for a bit, waited for a pause, and started a chorus of &quot;Hit the Road Jack,&quot; which the outside crowd picked up.&nbsp; Jack tried to scream for a minute, then hit the road. <br /><br />solidarity!

				I love this guy as well. I think he has improved over the months and his performances have grown from about 5 minutes to about 20 minutes each night. <br /><br />Whoever you are, THANK YOU!

				I agree! I&#039;ve run into so many neighbors that I have not seen in years over the past few months on 34th and elsewhere. There are so many amazing people here in JH.

				I got to experience the trumpet guy a few weeks ago for the first time! Actually, it was when the Naked Cowboy also stopped by!?&nbsp; I&#039;m so glad he&#039;s still going strong; I&#039;ll have to walk down and hang out on the corner again soon!<br /><br />I am also LOVING the 34th Ave closure, and every day it looks like HUNDREDS are also enjoying it. Runners, walkers, bikers, kids - being outside and moving, playing, socially distant interacting - it&#039;s healthy for us all! I would really love to see what this community could do to permanently close the Avenue, although I&#039;m sure that&#039;s a long shot.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;We still have next to nothing in the lower 70&#039;s for the clapping at 7:00. Even so often you hear some kind of effort but nowhere near like others are reporting. It just didn&#039;t take here. Also want to note for those who are afraid of the density and lack of masks on 34th Ave., try 32nd Ave which is nearly empty almost all times of day. The sidewalks are a better bet now for safe distancing actually. It&#039;s great to see people outside with kids but scary for alot of people who are recovering or very concerned about the spread. Let&#039;s see when playgrounds, gyms, beaches and parks reopen what interest and use level remains for the open streets.<br /><br />&nbsp;There are also a number of night walkers now who find the cooler temps and fewer people much more conducive to a good walk.

				If I was hearing trumpet man, maybe I would have different views.&nbsp; But all I hear are pots and pans, car horns, and inane clapping, and I hate it.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait for it to end.

				I was wondering why it&#039;s been getting quieter on 78th Street this week. Then I saw a crowd on 34th Avenue tonight cheering for the trumpeter playing &quot;Tequila&quot;. Coincidence?

				he&#039;s done different instruments (i think there may have even been a clarinet at one point).<br /><br />today&#039;s additions to the repertoire included &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (a really good, not too sweet version) and &quot;Arthur&#039;s Theme&quot; (the crowd seemed to dig it)

				34th and 35th Avenues are normally fairly quiet and that&#039;s the beauty of a planned community. However, we&#039;re talking here about a time when our neighborhood and the surrounding areas have been hard hit by Covid 19. <br /><br />Trumpet man is bringing people together (yes I see social social distancing and masks - don&#039;t start) in a time when people need to feel community and support. A little appreciation for the folks who kept us going during this pandemic is a great thing. It also gives us an opportunity to see each other and know that our neighbors are there and doing well, especially when folks would otherwise be hiding inside. A little exercise to get up and dressed to go out for some fresh air and see him might do some slugs a little good.<br /><br />For any of the haters - GET OVER IT! It&#039;s 7PM not midnight, and it doesn&#039;t go on for that long. Try some community spirit. If it bothers you that much shut your window, pull the drapes so you don&#039;t have to see, and get yourself a set of ear plugs. <br /><br /><br /><br />
