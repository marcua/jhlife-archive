				While getting my hair colored at 82nd and Northern, I learned the next door shop being renovated now will be a laundromat sharing space with a Cannelle takeout! Yay for a closer Cannelle&#039;s.

				That&#039;s going to be a dangerous block, calorie wise. Los Amigos pizza (the best pizza in the neighborhood IMO) is across the street at 82nd and Northern as well.

				The last we heard about this, the bakery was going to be opened by the owners of Seba Seba (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=18044.0).&nbsp; Are you sure your source has it right?

				I grabbed these pics from Parva&#039;s Instagram account. The first two pics are a retro &#039;before&#039;, and a modern day &#039;after&#039; of the work they&#039;re doing to build Parva Coffee. The third one is the account for Aquarelo Laundromat, a laundry service they also seem to be opening, but on the 82nd Street side. Hope this is not confusing.&nbsp; ::) I can&#039;t imagine that Cannelle would be sharing a space with the laundromat. Perhaps there&#039;s an additional smaller storefront also being constructed?<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/y9x8GWA.jpg)

				I like the look of what they&#039;re doing. Seems a <em>little</em> weird to have a laundromat/bakery combo, but I guess 1. the bills gotta be paid and 2. hopefully there will be separate entrances so it feels like separate businesses? Weird to order a croissant while someone&#039;s dirty laundry is on the spin cycle...

				Perfect for having a coffee/patisserie while you wait for your laundry wash cycle.<br /><br />Love the inventive combination.

				it seems like a cool idea to me. there are combo laundromat/bar (with food) combos all over the place. i&#039;d partake.

				Talked to Parva on IG. It&#039;s the kids of Seba Seba. They are having the bakery/coffee shop in front of the laundromat. Seems cool.
