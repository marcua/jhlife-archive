Whether the neighbors are friendly or not depends on which floor you live on since there are few apartments per floor. <br /><br />There is Fios. The service is good but Verizon will try to cheat you. <br /><br />The basement is safe.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hear that the side streets 73rd and 74th are noisy. 35th avenue has more traffic because of the closing of 34th avenue but it is not bad. Queens has bad planning. They do one thing without thinking of the ramifications.<br /><br />The subway is quick to Manhattan. The apps would be accurate as to timing. You might get a seat on the subway. <br /><br />The renovations of the co-ops has been going on for YEARS. I am now listening to BANGING from some construction that has been going on for days (weeks?). It may stop some years into the future. <br /><br />The water is filthy, and there are bugs. <br /><br />The people get argumentative in the laundry room. Everyone is an expert, and they will tell you why. <br /><br />The residents usually wear masks. <br /><br />I will open a can of worms, but, the newer residents have a great deal of attitude. The building was calmer and more pleasant before it became co-ops.

				The neighborhood is phenomenal! The buildings vary -- some are very well run, and people are friendly; others aren&#039;t. I live in a small coop that&#039;s part of a larger complex, and there&#039;s a fantastic sense of community. <br />Good luck.

				Thank you everyone for your responses.&nbsp; jh35, it&#039;s hard to know what to make of &quot;it&#039;s a very nice building&quot; along with &quot;the water is filthy.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe due to the ongoing construction?&nbsp;

The water is intermittently bad. About every few weeks coffee starts coming out of the faucets.&nbsp; I think they put in cheap small filters (that need to be cleaned periodically) when they changed the pipes.&nbsp; Generally, the people in the building are nice and pleasant.&nbsp; The management company is decent.&nbsp; There are no major problems.&nbsp;

				lived here for 4+ years now. I&#039;d say i&#039;ve for sure experienced the water thing, but it&#039;s nothing i&#039;d have remembered to complain about here. if it was as bad as jh35 says i&#039;d just talk to the super to get it sorted, he&#039;s very on top of things despite it being a huge co-op.<br /><br />that laundry thing is funny. in my experience a lot of the older residents do antiquated things to the machines (which just got replaced with new units btw) such as flush them with a ton of water, or use powdered detergent (i don&#039;t get this at this point) also do things like put those new sprinkled fabric softeners in the top compartments instead of directly in the unit where they belong, leaving the product there to stink up the next persons load with a terrible perfumed smell. it&#039;s maddening and although i&#039;ve never gotten into it w anyone i could see why someone might.<br /><br />ppl are fine, friendly if you are for the most part. it&#039;s still nyc, i wouldn&#039;t expect pleasantville.<br />&nbsp;<br />

				This is a followup to my original post.&nbsp; I did eventually move to Washinton Plaza, and I love it.&nbsp; The place is well maintained, people are generally friendly, the garden is lovely, and it&#039;s the perfect distance from the train station (quick walk, but away from the noise).&nbsp; So far, I haven&#039;t encountered any water problems.&nbsp;
