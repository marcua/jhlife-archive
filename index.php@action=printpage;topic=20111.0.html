				Hi All! I moved to JH in October and I&#039;ve been so surpised that no supermarkets really sell whole bean coffee. I&#039;ve usually been lucky at Downtown Natural Market but the selection is way more limited lately with very little to no whole bean coffee available or the only ones being 15+ for a 10 oz bag. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

				Lemon Farms at 37th and 78th has a decent variety, and Espresso 77 sells its beans (i forget which local roaster they use).

				The Illy brand coffee at Lemon Farms comes as whole beans and it is very good. I would avoid the bins of beans they also sell there--because who knows how fresh those would be. At times Lemon Farms has also carried a brand that I think is called Joe&#039;s, which is also good. E77 has great beans as well. And of course you can always order beans from various places as well. We found a brand we like called Saccuzzo--a roaster in Connecticut. We drank their coffee at a restaurant in Connecticut, and inquired where it was from. We order from them and also buy from E77 and Lemon Farm. Like them all.

				It&#039;s not local to Jackson Heights, but if you want superb beans perfectly roasted with lightning fast free shipping and great customer service, La Colombe is a solid choice. They ship orders over $30 for free and they epitomize what a coffee retailer should be.

				Foodtown has whole bean coffee in the coffee aisle. I&#039;m guessing they&#039;re all under $15/pound.

				Porto Rico coffee in Manhattan is the best!&nbsp; Since 1907!&nbsp; Their coffee is fresh and reasonably priced.&nbsp; They have tea as well.&nbsp; I like going to the store - they have 3 locations, my favorite is on Bleecker, but they have free shipping with a $75 order.

				Espresso 77 sells Gimmie coffee beans. You can also find whole bean commercial brands (Starbucks, etc.) at Foodtown. Is there something specific you had in mind that you can&#039;t find?

				I order Starbucks ground coffee from Walmart.&nbsp; They also have whole bean and the price is a bargain at $11.99 for 20 oz versus Foodtown price of $11.99 for 10 oz.&nbsp; They ship free and have next day delivery if you order early in the day.&nbsp; They ship from New Jersey.&nbsp;

				We used to get coffee from Native Roasters in Astoria and also Oslo in Brooklyn, but for the last couple-few years we&#039;ve been ordering online from a small roaster my wife found in PA, Black &amp; Brass.

				Buying local-- Espresso 77 and Cafe de Colombia have great beans-- is definitely awesome if you can swing it. Especially vital at a time like this. Sweet Leaf (in Queens and Brooklyn) also has great beans and very fast shipping if you order online.

				Lemon Farm has selection of whole beans. They will also grind the beans on request.<br /><br />The Colombian supreme is great. Seems popular and reasonably freshly roasted.

				Porto Rico Importing is my favorite roaster in the city. Very fair price for the quality but their $75 threshold for free shipping is a bit high for us.<br /><br />I also order from Pintail, a Long Island roaster, which sells $6 12-oz bags of great regional blends and has a $30 threshold for free shipping.<br /><br />Parva is quite good but $9 for 11 oz still feels steep no matter the quality.<br /><br />When all else fails, I always have a brick of Bustelo in the back of the closet
