				My old landlord used to go nuts (no pun intended) because the squirrels would dig up her plants all the time. she would just fix it and the squirrels would continue to wreck them. It was like road runner vs coyote. :)

				Ive been having trouble with the little creatures eating through the air conditioning side pieces. I got some &#039;Animal B-Gone&#039; and sprayed it through the gaps they made. No effect. Then I stuffed paper towels in the holes and saturated it with AB-G. That works very well. My friend has contented him/herself with eating the foam insulation under the air conditioner now.<br /><br />Nature, gotta love it.

				Oh my gosh. Had the same problem in my last JH place. They&#039;d chew thru, stick their heads in and chirp. Used this hot pepper spray on towels which worked :)

				I had the same problem as well. I taped folded aluminum containers from the dollar store on the sides and it has kept them away.<br />

				I&#039;ve had squirrels eat through the aluminum siding below my windows.&nbsp; The things will eat anything just to spite people.&nbsp; then they act all cute and innocent.&nbsp; evil beings.

				JHlobo,<br />I like that idea. I’ve got to find a big container cause the tree is about a foot in diameter. They must be out there though. Thank you!<br />@Chingwa -I couldn’t have said it better!

This relatively cool summer has provided us with gorgeous and lasting plants and flowers. I&#039;ve been strolling along JH streets and have found some urban farming, the most interesting being the seven foot corn growing on 89th Street btw 35th and 37th.&nbsp; The peach tree on the same street is abundant with perfect looking fruit, but the house has no willing or able farmer and the ones that drop don&#039;t survive the fall. How could anyone possibly get up there? On the other end of town, near Cannelle, across from what looks to be a Muslim community space, the homeowner is growing grapes.<br /><br />This is, of course, stuff that can be seen from the sidewalk.

				Props to Ada, who is the magic behind the McIntosh (spelling?) Community Garden in what I guess is elmhurst (or corona), about 100th Street north of Astoria Blvd. Pretty amazing place. She gave me a tour. McIntosh is growing organic pumpkin, watermelon, peaches, grapes, figs, toms, cukes, aubergines, zuchini, carrots, sweet potatoes, herbs, flowers, and more. <br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting this is becuz Ada tells me some folks from JH help in, and therefore reap the rewards of, the garden.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anybody on here know about this place or know Ada?<br /><br />There was a happy squirrel in the garden. Ada didn&#039;t appear one bit concerned.
