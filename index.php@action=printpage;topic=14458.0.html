				This week&#039;s roundup by Sweeten Blog includes a 2 BR in Linden Court for $399k:<br /><br />http://blog.sweeten.com/on-the-market/top-five-fixer-uppers-on-the-market-in-nyc-8/<br /><br />Says Sweeten Blog:<br /><br />&quot;What we love: Historic, landmarked building, over ten feet of south-facing windows in living/dining, generously-sized rooms, great character.<br /><br />What we’d do: $20k is a good starting point for a basic kitchen renovation in New York City. A gut kitchen renovation would add significant value to this home. Some owners might be tempted to update the bathroom but we love the West Coast vibe with those mod teal tiles!&quot;<br /><br />Listing at NY Times Real Estate:<br />http://www.nytimes.com/real-estate/usa/ny/queens/jackson-heights/homes-for-sale/37-18-85th-street/857-55D8512F1FF93<br /><br />I have to agree about the renovations — kitchen is a must but those bathroom tiles look fine to me and I like the unusual color.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always admired the windows in Linden Court. This is a lovely home.

				It does have a nice lofty feel to it.<br /><br />Is nearly $1400/mo in maintenance a little on the high side for a 2b/1bath?

Linden court apartment looks spacious and nice, but why is the maintenance almost $1400? Seems high for a two bedroom/ one bath apartment? I saw a three bedroom/ two baths Chateau on 81st Street and that maintenance was only $1080.

				Its my guess that that $1,400 includes a temporary assessment to cover the renovation the building has undertaken over the past few months.&nbsp; 2 bedroom maintenances usually run half that in Linden Court, given the no elevator and garage/rental income streams.<br /><br />I guess the NY Times article and the blog did something, as it is in contract after almost 5 months!

Like 400 for a 1 bed and 600-700 for a 2 bedroom.<br /><br />I guess it went up, but DOUBLE? They must have had to do extensive work on the building. I guess that&#039;s one of the dangers in buying in a very old building, eventually they need a lot of work.<br /><br />I checked and checked and nowhere does it say it&#039;s an assessment though, does anyone know if the maintenance increase is permanent? That would be tough to swallow for older residents there if it&#039;s permanent, not to mention it lowers the value of the apartments considerably. The building must be in bad financial shape if they had to go ahead with such a dramatic increase, usually that would be an absolute last resort.

				This 2 bdr Linden Court apartment sold in 2012 and listed a $578 maintenance.&nbsp; http://www.ottonielsenrealty.com/listingLINDENCOURT3728_42_2BR1BA.html<br /><br />This 2 bedroom in Linden Court sold in 2008, and at that time the maintenance was $780.&nbsp; http://www.jacksonheightsproperties.com/agent/listings2.php?listing=8c941e983fdd1ff9410869adafa2d5c4&amp;username=vsimkhov<br /><br />Seems like the maintenance costs are all over the place.&nbsp; Maybe the cost also depends on the floor, especially since it&#039;s a walkup.<br /><br />

				The apartment for sale in 2008 Shelby referenced is the same one featured by the OP, so talk about a perfect example.<br /><br />$780 a month maintenance back then was pretty high, so perhaps there is a large, underlying mortgage the building had to take out and we are still seeing the effects of it?<br /><br />Of the 10 Linden Court co-ops, the middle 6 each have an apartment that they can rent out to help keep the maintenance down.&nbsp; The corner 4, however, do not, so that can explain some of it (the said co-op is in a corner).&nbsp; That the land is already owned helps keep it down as well.&nbsp; Also, the corner co-ops only have 12 units, as opposed to the middle 6, which have 16.&nbsp; This puts renovations more heavily on the fewer units.

I recently saw another two bed apt that needs work from the Linden Court and the maint was only $650. It was listed at 325k and went into contract within few weeks after it was listed. Thats a huge difference between these maint from building to building.<br /><br />http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3727-84th-Street-32-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372/2100197945_zpid/<br /><br />http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3727-84th-Street-32-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372/2100197945_zpid/
