			Deshi Biryani has been through a number of incarnations in recent years -- as a Bangladeshi restaurant called Grameen, then a place promising everything from Indian to Thai food, then a pretty good steam table-type place.&nbsp; Its latest edition, back to a Bangladeshi restaurant with no more steam tables, shouldn&#039;t be missed.&nbsp; It&#039;s getting great reviews on Chowhound.&nbsp; And here&#039;s another blogger who declares it &quot;yes another reason to get out of Manhattan&quot;<br /><br />I noticed this weekend that they finally have take-out menus available.&nbsp; And, perhaps taking a cue from Espresso 77, they also offer free wifi.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a review from the Village Voice last fall.<br /><br />Anybody have a favorite dish to order there?

			I happen to Desi Biryani, through all it&#039;s incarnations. I went there recently with a co-worker, who is from Manhattan, and it was better than ever. This was about a month ago.

			I have been a couple of times and have been unimpressed.&nbsp; A lot of their dishes are not very specific--like &quot;Chicken curry.&quot;&nbsp; I could see a generic dish like that in another hood, but here?!&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had the Biryani though, and maybe that&#039;s better.&nbsp; Also the service was pretty bad and they shortchanged me.

			We went to Deshi Biryani and were unimpressed.&nbsp; My wife ordered the house specialty and it was only so-so; as was my biryani.

			I&#039;ve tried this place and didn&#039;t really think much of it either - especially the fact that if you pick up the food to go, it&#039;s given to you ice cold.&nbsp; Now isn&#039;t that illegal/unsanitary - you&#039;re supposed to hold hot food in a steam table at 145 degrees.&nbsp; Desi Biryani does this, Kebab Cafe does it, and I won&#039;t go back to them because of that. Anyone have any secrets as to how these places aren&#039;t making tons of people sick?
