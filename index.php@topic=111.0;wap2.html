			Hi,<br />I am selling my Heywood-Wakefield Butterfly Dining Room Table.&nbsp; List price is $1,795 but I am selling my table for $1,250.&nbsp; I will include 6 chairs with this purchase.&nbsp; One of the chairs has a different upholstery. I&#039;ve had this table for 3 years and is in excellent condition. Cash/money order and pick-up only<br /><br />Here is a description and photo of the table from the website:&nbsp; <br />http://www.heywood-wakefield.com/detail.cgi?m197g?dining<br /><br /><br />Description: A little-known fact about this table is that the â€œbutterflyâ€ in the name refers to the small swing-away piece used to support the drop-leaf. Designed in 1949 -originally without the butterfly - this table is perhaps the most instantly-recognized item in the entire line of solid birch wood Heywood-Wakefield furniture. The table comes with two removable 18&quot; extensions.<br /><br />Dimensions: Top is 40&quot; x 26&quot; closed, 40&quot; x 58&quot; with drop leaves up, 40&quot; x 94&quot; with leaves up and extension leaves in place. Height is 29&quot;.

			The chairs are I believe mahogany. They are not Heywood chairs but they match perfectly with the table. If you would like to see the table, email me off list.<br /><br />Aya
