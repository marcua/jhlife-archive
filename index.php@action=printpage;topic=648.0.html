				I&#039;m sure this won&#039;t be the last word in this thread, but it might be the last word on &quot;The Last Word&quot; (from dictionary.com):<br /><br /><div align="center">What is the absolute last word in any dictionary?<br /><br />Zyxt is listed as the last word in the online Oxford English Dictionary, an obsolete Kentish word that is the second singular indicative present form of the verb see. The next-to-last is zyxst, an obsolete word meaning &#039;sixth&#039;. Several online dictionaries list the word zyzzyva, a tropical American weevil, as the last word in the letter Z.</div><br />Hmm, actually, I suppose the next logical question is what&#039;s the absolute last word in any dictionary IN ANY LANGUAGE!<br />

Yeah, like as soon as anyone else has the nerve to try to post the last word, your script would keep me, errr, ummm, someone posting right after them so that that someone would never have to post here again. See?<br /><br />If it&#039;s really easy fer ya, just let someone know how much you want. And don&#039;t talk money, Mr. Foobah, talk about something wonderful like home cooked meals, or car washings. Ya see? <br /><br />Instead of Last Word, let&#039;s play Let&#039;s Make A Deal.<br /><br />Just think on it for a little while, okay, Mr. Foobah?<br /><br />Sincerely yours,<br />NYCMacUser<br />known elsewhere as MamaMac

				You folks are so lucky to have such big kitchens. I&#039;ve got one of those kitchens, that when you&#039;re pregnant, you have to go out of the kitchen and come back in just to turn around!<br /><br />But it sure is easy to keep clean. I redid mine in 2001. I replaced everything including the cabinets, the floor, the sink, refrigerator, self-cleaning ovens, and the washer. I got so crazy doing it I even replaced a perfectly good microwave and toaster to match the decor! I wouldn&#039;t go through that again if you paid me . . . well . . . maybe . . . if you paid me enough!<br /><br />Good Night and Good Luck.

The law states:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.&quot;<br /><br />Godwin&#039;s Law is often cited in online discussions as a caution against the use of inflammatory rhetoric or exaggerated comparisons, and is often conflated with fallacious arguments of the reductio ad Hitlerum form.<br /><br />The rule does not make any statement whether any particular reference or comparison to Hitler or the Nazis might be appropriate, but only asserts that one arising is increasingly probable. It is precisely because such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate, Godwin has argued that overuse of Nazi and Hitler comparisons should be avoided, because it robs the valid comparisons of their impact. Although in one of its early forms Godwin&#039;s Law referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions, the law is now applied to any threaded online discussion: electronic mailing lists, message boards, chat rooms, and more recently blog comment threads and wiki talk pages.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				&#039;Allo everyone!<br /><br />Been busy outside in the sun and cleaning up from the recent construction work.<br /><br />Might stay up to try to have LW for the day. Might crash.<br /><br />Gardening yesterday. Sooo good for the spirit! We made a little pathway with reclaimed bricks. No money involved, just spirit and sweat.<br />The chives, lemon thyme, parsley, lemon balm, oregano, pineapple mint, valerian (looks good, not useful) and worm wood all survived. We think the tarragon did, too, and maybe the lavender.<br /><br />Strawberries have blossoms on them. <br /><br />Basil planting and different kind thyme in the the near future. <br /><br />Yay, Spring!<br /><br />PS The garden is public, over at Saint Mark&#039;s on the 82nd St. side, to the left of the door. Feel free to pick herbs judiciously, or, better, come and dig with us!

Anyone wanna come over and take what you want?<br />&nbsp;:)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Pass. I toss out my own crap every year by giving it The Salvation Army/Good Will on Steinway.&nbsp; And when I say &quot;crap&quot; I mean really good&nbsp; stuff that I just don&#039;t use or wear any more.&nbsp; I&#039;m still sorry I gave them my entire album collection including all my 45s.&nbsp; The last word is: tax write offs

				Flea Market result. One glass lamp &amp; shade purchased for $4.00. I offered to fix a friend&#039;s lamp, but have waited too long and now found it needs a piece. The FM purchase is to show good will.<br /><br />I&#039;m a big Salvation Army donator myself.<br /><br />I like the goal of seeing the back of the closet. I will keep that in mind.

				YIPPEE! Someone is coming over on Monday to go through my book cases. <br /><br />Now I need someone to do the same for records. I have thousands. I not only have my own collection of vinyl, but also my parents and my sister&#039;s. I haven&#039;t yet fully cataloged them all, but they start in the 1920s and go through the 1970s and range from opera to doo-wop.<br /><br />Hey, I finally got rid of my 8-tracks. Can you believe someone actually gave me money for them?<br /><br />What is it they say . . . someone&#039;s trash may be someone else&#039;s treasure.

				I don&#039;t have the patience. <br /><br />I have a doll collection, started by my great-grandmother that I am hoping to leave for a granddaughterâ€”if I ever get one! If not I will have it sold. That might be worth something. My prime objective now, is to get rid of books, records, business clothes, all the chotchkies I&#039;ve collected from around the world, boxes of picture frames . . . all the clutter. I&#039;ve even got a 4 drawer, hanging-file cabinet that I am going to weed out useless crap. I&#039;ve been in my apartment since 1964 and I have every stupid piece of paper I ever got from any of the landlords and DHCR. I have boxes of sports memorabilia, historic newspapers and magazinesâ€”all kinds of &#039;stuff&#039; that my children don&#039;t have any interest inâ€”so out it goes!<br /><br />I might start putting some of the stuff on <span class="bbc_u">freecycle</span> (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freecyclenewyorkcity/).<br /><br />This clutter is driving me crazy.

				Buddy, your question is very Zen. How will I take a picture of nothing? :coolsmiley:<br /><br />At the moment all the contents of a 7&#039; bookcase AND a 2 drawer lateral file cabinet are strewn around the apartment. No room is safe, save the bathroom. As I look at my bedroom right now, I see 2 virgin scrapbooks. Oops, make that 3. Countless papers that need to be shredded, but the shredder is still in it&#039;s box. <br /><br />Oh, it is all too much.

				I had Verizon here for 4 1/2 hours yesterday. It seems the main box to my whole apartment is buried in the bottom of the one closet I hadn&#039;t planned on tackling until next year! WHAT A MESS! But, at least I have my phone service back. And just to sing their praises, T-Mobile gave me a couple hundred extra minutes FREE to see me through not having a landline for a week. They were such a joy to work with. BTW, folks, that wire charge is so well worth paying on your Verizon bill. They practically rewired my whole place.

				Buddy - did you like the LA house? I loved it.<br /><br />How was lunch?<br /><br />My crash was so spectacular that I had to have a friend screw on a jar top. Couldn&#039;t figure it out! So sad.<br /><br />Ate and perked right up!<br /><br />Got the first batch of give aways given. Second will be books (3 boxes) to JH Jewish Center. Last (3 more boxes) will be odd stuff - a sump pump, for example, will go to Saint Mark&#039;s June Flea Market. This means more space in the basement store room! And the cycle will begin again. . . :buck2:

				Apologies to all. Yes, the Louis Armstrong house. I loved the kitchen and all the wallpaper.<br /><br />Sump pump - well, many years ago, shortly after Thanksgiving, my son and I were awoken by a geyser of water shooting up out of the kitchen sink! It was raining out and whatever the problem with the building&#039;s aging water lines and downspouts had caused a mini Old Faithful. <br /><br />After hours of bailing, disinfecting, etc. We blocked the drain, put a heavy kettle with rocks in it over the drain and had the plumber come. <br /><br />The son is a very cautious person and went out and purchased a sump pump in case it happened again. It hasn&#039;t, but there are very strange sounds from that sink still. <br /><br />It was an awful experience and we still had to go to work in the morning. Ugh.<br /><br /><br />

				My Mom and (Aunt) Lucy, (Uncle) Satchmo&#039;s wife, had a weekly poker game that rotated from house to house. Although I was only around 7 and my sister around 10, I vividly remember the night my Dad was out of town and Mom took us to the game at their house. (Uncle) Satchmo played games with us and then he and 2 of his friends took us out for dinner to a restaurant on either Northern or Queens Boulevard for fried chicken and French fries. (I wish I could remember the name of the place.) I didn&#039;t realize the significance of this until many, many years later when I heard him retell the story at my wedding about how 3 black men took 2 little, red-haired, white girls out for fried chicken at a family-style restaurant and how they were at first unwilling to seat us until they realized who he was. Whenever that poker game was at our house, Aunt Lucy always brought my sister and me a board game to keep us busy so the cussing-related game could be played without interruption.<br /><br />The Armstrongs will always have a very special place in my heart for the kindnesses and love they shared with us. My darling Aunt Lucy especially, for all those forbidden words we learned on Tuesday nights.

				Oh, Mac, what a NICE story! Thank you for sharing it.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know the Armstrongs at all, but once held the door for Mrs. A when she was going into Clark&#039;s. Later my mom told me who she was. I was really thrilled.<br /><br />One of the goals of my life is to be as wonderful as those &#039;grown ups&#039; I admired as a child. It&#039;s so hard to tell if you are making any kind of positive difference in this era and I&#039;m pretty discouraged right now.<br /><br />I am friends with the grand daughter of my &#039;Auntie Mame&#039;. This woman would let me stay over at her house when my uncle and 4 horrible cousins* would come to stay, she took me to the theater and out to posh restaurants, and was one of the wittiest people I&#039;ve ever known.<br /><br />Fortunately the grand daughter has inherited the wit, and I am thrilled that, even though I&#039;m 20 years older than she, we are equals and friends.<br /><br />Great First Words of the Day, Mac!<br /><br /><br />*once they grew up, they were okay.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ll walk the dogs over to your house so you can style them, too!<br /><br />Actually, I really can&#039;t. Frankie is still in bandages. He had an awful bleed on Sunday night. If he doesn&#039;t put that paw down by Monday he&#039;ll have to go back on IV antibiotics. It had been almost 4 months of having him be his playful puppy self and it is so easy to forget about that damned cancer crapola. It caught me really off guard. Not even a TIGHT tourniquet stopped the bleeding. I didn&#039;t even stop at red lights on the way to the vet. Someday I am going to get stopped by a cop. My only hope is that he will be a dog lover and provide me an escort when he sees Frankie and me covered with blood.

There are also resorts in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. But the luxury ones are all in Argentina and Chile as is the best powder. The season is from June to around the end of September the first week of October. But if you can imagine boarding a plane at JFK in 103 degree weather in the middle of August, and disembarking in frigid weather and heading for the slopes . . . I DID IT IN 1988. It was number 26 on my Bucket List. Thank G-d, I was religious about doing one from my list (which I started in Junior High School) every couple of years.<br /><br />The BBQ was such fun. Doggies, doggies everywhere! Well behaved doggies, too, that is until the boomers started! We all got soaked, well-fed, duly inebriated and ended up with sore jaws from all the laughing. There was enough food for a small invading army; hamburgers, Kosher hot dogs, Italian sausage, marinated chicken breasts, dried lamb lung, salads, Key Lime pies, ice cream sammies with whipped cream and cherries, soft drinks, hard drinks, beer, and, of course, all the fixins! Oh, yeah, the dried lamb lungs were exclusively for the doggies.

				<strong>I usually don&#039;t go to new places unless someone says it was good.&nbsp; I have gone to a few in Astoria but I find them to be hit and miss as with most places.&nbsp; I think a lot of these places either try to hard to look good and miss on the food or vice versa.&nbsp; Whenever I&#039;m doing renovations at Acropolis I will stop and have a glass of wine and a snack at 718Restaurant.&nbsp; I like the decor and they are Located on 35-01 Ditmars Blvd.&nbsp; The food is good, nicely mixed menu but I never go there for dinner, just a quick stop on my way out of a job site.&nbsp; It&#039;s really a nice looking place and when it&#039;s not too humid out I&#039;ll sit outside.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />(http://www.718restaurant.com/bkgd_images/Rest718-225px.gif)<br /><br />There is a new Nuevo Latino place across from it.&nbsp; Next time I&#039;m in the area I&#039;ll stop in...</strong><br /><br />

				Funny that you should mention the lower cost of gasoline comparing it to a slice of pizza.&nbsp; There was an article in today&#039;s Daily News stating that the cost of ingredients necessary to make pizza has also gone down significantly...yet the cost of a slice remains the same.<br /><br />Today&#039;s last word is Protest!

				Hey, easy on that 34th Ave slam. I&#039;m close to there, too! And a lovely Ave it is. <br />Back in Ancient Times, when the streets had large Islands on them, I used to walk my dog. And, no, sadly, or ignorantly, we didn&#039;t pick up the poop. We thought it was compost. Maybe. I was a kid, what did I know?????<br /><br />Nice to be back here on TLW ecven though it is early in the 10th and not the waning hours of the 9th.<br /><br />We are past the date of Mid-Winter, so it has to get warmer. It just HAS to!!!!!

I assure you that we on the NAR Leadership Team are experiencing the same problems in our businesses. In fact, VP &amp; Liaison to Committees Steve Brown recently shared his experiences in Ohio on the Voices of Real Estate blog.<br />http://narblog1.realtors.org/mvtype/president/2009/06/all_is_not_quiet_on_the_midwes.html (http://narblog1.realtors.org/mvtype/president/2009/06/all_is_not_quiet_on_the_midwes.html)<br /><br />Let me update you on what NAR is doing to resolve these problems quickly.<br /><br />On Monday, June 29th, I will be in New York to meet with the Deputy Attorney General and his staff who worked directly on the Home Valuation Code of Conduct. I plan to share our concerns, as well as your stories, and ask for their assistance in resolving any problems related to the HVCC.<br /><br />On Tuesday, June 30th, I will travel to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to discuss ways we can work with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and lenders to ensure that appraisals are accurate.<br /><br />We will keep you posted on the outcome of these meetings. In the meantime, I encourage you to check out the following resources on Realtor.org for more information on the HVCC and how appraisal problems are impacting the real estate market:<br /><br />Economists Podcast<br />http://www.realtor.org/research/research/research_podcast062309?LID=RONav0021 &nbsp;(http://www.realtor.org/research/research/research_podcast062309?LID=RONav0021) <br /><br />HVCC<br />http://www.realtor.org/government_affairs/gapublic/gses_hvcc_announced &nbsp;(http://www.realtor.org/government_affairs/gapublic/gses_hvcc_announced) <br /><br />Appraisal Blog<br />http://narblog1.realtors.org/mvtype/appraisalinsight/ &nbsp;(http://narblog1.realtors.org/mvtype/appraisalinsight/) <br /><br />On behalf of the entire Leadership Team and staff, I thank all of you who have shared your experiences and concerns with us. With your continued participation, I believe we will overcome this challenge in much the same way as we have conquered others â€“ &quot;United Toward Tomorrow.&quot;<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br /><br /><br />Charles McMillan<br />CIPS, GRI<br />2009 NAR President<br /><br />

				What is the absolute last word in any dictionary?<br /><br />Zyxt is listed as the last word in the online Oxford English Dictionary, an obsolete Kentish word that is the second singular indicative present form of the verb see. The next-to-last is zyxst, an obsolete word meaning &#039;sixth&#039;. Several online dictionaries list the word zyzzyva, a tropical American weevil, as the last word in the letter Z.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />(taken from Dictionary.com)

				As that thread reads you were troll baiting my previous post by asking me what Gladys says. <br />The response was she can’t be bothered. And then a cut and paste from urban dictionary as to your names meaning.<br /><br />Please quote accurately and within context.<br /><br />God bless

				It&#039;s too soon to actually get the last word, but I just want to wish all my fellow JH Residents the best in the New Year. We may not agree about 34th Ave and Diversity Plaza, but we agree that we&#039;re going to miss visiting this site to find out new restaurants and what&#039;s going on and who is opening in the old space and where we can find a decent haircut! I wish everyone continued health and hope to bump into you on the street some day if I ever leave my apartment again. Stay well!

				&nbsp;Amen JH Resident. Agreement was not always the goal in my personal postings. The ability to say one&#039;s thoughts in an open air, though online, forum was invigorating and something that gave a good deal of insight and pleasure throughout the years. None of the other venues online has even come close to the level of thought provoking discourse that has occasionally happened here over the years. Wishing everyone well in their new exchanges. <br /><br />&nbsp; And for the record, tweeting and Trump go together in my mind. Let&#039;s not go there please! Can Shekar get a new outlet for his non tweety constituents? Town crier style?
