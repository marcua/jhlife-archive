					There has been a lot of chatter about the upcoming City Council race!&nbsp; It goes without saying that the more engaged our community is the better-off we will all be.&nbsp; To that end, letâ€™s not forget that we have an all-important Mayorâ€™s race, with the democratic primaries this Tuesday and the general election on November 3.<br /><br />In the general election I am supporting Mike Bloomberg for Mayor because I believe he has provided strong, independent leadership at City Hall, leadership that is based on progress and whatâ€™s good for this city.<br /><br />For those of you who are supporting Bloomberg or are still deciding who to support for Mayor, I invite you to a community forum that a number of local residents are planning.&nbsp; &nbsp;At the community forum you will be able to ask Maura Keaney, a high-level official in the Bloomberg campaign, questions about the Mayorâ€™s plan for education, housing, parks, and other issues in Jackson Heights and New York City.&nbsp; Ms. Keaney is the Field Director of Mike Bloombergâ€™s campaign and served as the deputy chief of staff for New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and the State Political Director for the labor union Unite Here.<br /><br />I hope to see many of you at the forum.&nbsp; There will be limited seating capacity so please arrive early.&nbsp; Details on the community forum are as follows:<br /><br /><strong>What:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Bloomberg Jackson Heights Community Forum<br />Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, September 17, 2009<br />Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 p.m.<br />Place:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewish Center, 37-06 77th Street</strong><br /><br />Bryan<br />

					The Film Festival component of the Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival opens tonight, Thursday, September 18th with Chop Shop a timely and poignant feature length film which focuses on life stories at the Willets Point &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; a local place in the middle of a development battle royale.<br /><br />We also open with a 12 minute short film from Burundi, &quot;Basket Boy&quot;, about a ten-year-old named Kivumvu (Kirundi for &#039;basket&#039;) who searches for the origins of his often-mocked name.<br />&nbsp;<br />Avoid waiting on a long line.&nbsp; Go to <a href="http://www.jhfff.org/buy.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhfff.org/buy.html</a> to buy tickets online now.<br /><br />The film screenings continue Friday through Sunday with award-winning films from all over the world which is reflective of the unmatched diversity in Jackson Heights. Collectively, the films give a platform to emerging artists and offer a window into different cultural perspectives. Beyond the quality of the work, many are selected on the basis of their ability to reflect universal themes while capturing an experience that is unique to a particular group or part of the world. This year&#039;s films are rich with geography. Setting itself plays a significant role in the series. From the outskirts of a dusty, industrial city in Pakistan to the heat and humidity of the Colombian jungle-each film captures its location with great authenticity and sensitivity to detail. <br /><br />Visit <a href="http://www.jhfff.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhfff.org</a> for All the Details! <br /><br />Capital One bank is the proud primary sponsor of the festival. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Bryan Pu-Folkes

					Hi Everyone, <br /><br />A neighborhood friend asked me to pass this request on:&nbsp; &nbsp; Internationals Network is opening a school in San Francisco in Fall 2009, and the principal-designee is coming to NYC from August 20, 2008 through Thanksgiving 2008.&nbsp; Sonia Geerdes, the principal designee, will be interning at Flushing International High School this fall.&nbsp; The apt that the organization lined up for her just fell through.&nbsp; Sonia Geerdes is in need of a sublet or apt share in JH from August 20 through Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Sonia would live by herself there, but her husband is planning on coming out during her stay here at least once, maybe twice for a long weekend.The rent and apt expenses will be covered by the organization and clearly she is a serious professional, no pets, etc.&nbsp; Anyone who has an apt share or sublet available can contact Thomas Thomson at thomas.thomson@ internationalsne twork.org or 212-868-5180.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for any help you can provide. <br />Bryan <br /><br />

					Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I am excited to announce the establishment of&nbsp; a new local organization in support of community development for Jackson Heights&nbsp; - the <strong>â€œ<span class="bbc_u">Community Journal</span>.â€ </strong> The organization also publishes a community paper with the same name every two months.<br /><br />Like the Jackson Heights Film and Food Festival that we recently started and is now in its second successful year, the Community Journal will support the small businesses in the neighborhood that make our community such a great place to live and work.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Community Journal will be offering a host of free services, including workshops and seminars, and what is probably of most interest to this audience, <strong>a membership program, named <strong>&quot;<em>Go JH!</em>&quot; </strong>, that will give members discounts to some of our favorite neighborhood businesses and institutions </strong> including Novo, Y Gallery, the EFN Zone gym, Letyâ€™s Bakery, the Makeup Salon, Rajbhog, Jardi, Chamunda Swami, Aaron at Isabellaâ€™s and the Queens Museum of Art.&nbsp; In short time, even more businesses will be added!&nbsp; Join <em><strong>Go JH!</strong></em> now for the <strong>special discounted introductory price of $20/year until March 1, 2008</strong>.&nbsp; Members will receive a non-transferrable photo identification card.<br /><br />The December 2007 paper edition is out now and being distributed in local banks, supermarkets, coffee shops and other commercial spaces in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The paper is currently sixteen pages (will grow) and features news, entertainment and other items of interest to the community.&nbsp; So as we continue to rally for our neighborhood letâ€™s add <strong><em>Go JH!</em></strong> to our roster.&nbsp; <br /><br />These are tangible ways to support the community, its residents and businesses â€“ and there are always ways for volunteers to contribute to such efforts. To join Go JH! or to find out how you can help, contact me at <a href="mailto:communityjournal@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">communityjournal@gmail.com</a> or 718-393-7711. <br /><br />Bryan Pu-Folkes<br />
