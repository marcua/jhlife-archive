				When I occasionally take a bus at the 75Th street terminal I see gypsy cabs blocking the bus lanes,honking at prospective passengers,soliciting people who are just walking, making illegal u-turns so they are in front of the terminal and when the TLC or cops come they scatter like cockroaches. I think TLC inspectors should be stationed there permanently. Many of these so called cabs have no license and don&#039;t even have NY plates.

				I have to say that I have used those drivers on occasion.&nbsp; After working very late, then getting off the train just to take a bus the rest of the way home feels a little overwhelming.&nbsp; Also, I was extremely ill one night and had no cash -- I started to walk over to the Citibank and a livery driver helped me get there and then drove me home. He wasn&#039;t going to take money, but I insisted as I was grateful for his help. I haven&#039;t been at the 74th St station in a while, so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s gotten worse, but I&#039;ve been grateful for the ones that were there last fall.

				The livery cab drivers honk at me every time I walk down the street. Maybe they honk at everyone. I don&#039;t know. But they definitely honk at me. I&#039;m assuming I always look like I need a ride. But the only things that can be discerned about me from a moving car are my gender, my clothes and the color of my skin. So based on any or all of those things, the drivers make a snap judgment that I may need a ride and then honk at me. They&#039;re quickly profiling me, just as they&#039;re quickly profiling everyone they honk at. And part of that is based on race. This doesn&#039;t make them racists. They&#039;re businessmen, and they&#039;re trying to get business. If honking at who they feel is a likely customer didn&#039;t work, they would do something else.

				Just wanted to note that for some of us, the livery cab drivers provide a very useful service in a neighborhood that is generally under-served by yellow cabs.&nbsp; I live about 15 minutes walking distance from the 74th Street station (the bus seems to take even longer) â€“ which is usually not a big deal.&nbsp; But late at night or when if Iâ€™m carrying a lot of packages, the ready availability of the livery cabs is a tremendous convenience.&nbsp; Generally find drivers to be friendly/courteous â€“ no better or worse than yellow cab drivers.

				In four years we have used them for various reasons (too old being the root reason) probably 30 times.&nbsp; I have never seen a yellow cab when needed.&nbsp; The rate quoted was within a dollar of average, even when late at night and few options were available.&nbsp; Never had a problem.&nbsp; Often I don&#039;t even ask the rate, and it stays normal.&nbsp; They blow their horns at traffic congestion is my complaint, but that is easy to quiet down by threatening to turn them in to the taxi commission. Glad they are there when I want them!

				We occasionally use livery cabs when we need to get our dog into the city. (She&#039;s too big to fit into a carry bag on the subway) But for us, since Mexicana Car Service has a storefront dispatch about a block from us, we just go there and they&#039;ll call one of their cars for us. <br /><br />Since yellow cabs don&#039;t drive around or wait at the Roosevelt station, I wonder if some kind of livery cab dispatch near the station that managed the cabs and kept them from circling would help?

				To me, they are just part of the neighborhood.&nbsp; I often take the bus on 77th &amp; 31st (not the M22 but the Q47 on the opposite corner) and when I&#039;m running late I&#039;m glad to see those cabs.&nbsp; The same goes for coming out of the station at 74th, like if it&#039;s late at night or if I&#039;ve been shopping &amp; carrying bags.&nbsp; All I&#039;m saying is I have been in need of them at times and just ignored them at others.....kind of like a pay phone; not so much as a buzzing fly.

				These guys are just trying to make a living, why so much animosity towards them? I just took the TLC<br />Inspector exam a couple of weeks ago,it&#039;s given every 4 years. It&#039;s a very small agency,404 people.<br /><br />They issue violations,summonses,run license,registration checks,etc. However there are like 50,000+<br />cabs(yellow and livery) in NYC. The cabbies must know their schedule. They have undercover units<br />but just a few. TLC Inspectors are unarmed,but carry mace,a baton and hand cuffs. They have to know<br />the art of &quot;verbal judo&quot; to avoid a confrontation with a cab driver. The starting pay is very low,34k yr,but there is OT available,still top base pay is only 45k yr.

				I also think the livery cabs provide a valuable service.&nbsp; I&#039;ve rarely seen them honk around roosevelt avenue station (that might be just me though).&nbsp; Given that we don&#039;t get yellow cabs in the area, livery cabs are very useful.

				I do believe these cars are picking up passengers illegally. Only yellow medillions are, by law, allowed to pick up passengers off the street. And they do pay a lot for that privelage.Upward of $250.000 for that medillion on the hood. On the other hand, the Gypsy cabs are only allowed to answer calls that are phoned in. So, i think part of the reason their are no yellow cabs is that the illegal gypsy cabs are taking any buisness they might have away from them. I have seen the TLC do sweeps on Roosevelt ave, which i think their should be more of. Last night i saw the bus stop blocked by them, i saw them making illegal u turns, i saw them honking for no reason except the car in front of him wasnt moving fast enough, I saw them illegally idling, and i saw them illegallly picking up passengers.&nbsp; So the laws are made for a reason, but i guess these Gypsys believe they are above them

				Interesting that they are not allowed to pick people up in the street because at least half of the vehicles cruising around our neighborhood are car-service cars.&nbsp; They routinely pick up people that hail them from the street and there appears to be no enforcement whatsoever of rules prohibiting this.<br /><br />I always thought that if we had dedicated cab stands for them and truly prohibited them from cruising for fares, traffic would be reduced consderably around here.

				Purely from my own experience, in ten plus years in Jackson Heights I can say that Iâ€™ve taken livery cabs on many occasions and have never had a memorably bad experience.&nbsp; Some drivers are better than others, some more courteous than others but everyone is basically OK (I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to call them â€œshadyâ€)<br /><br />It seems pretty clear to me that, whatever the objections to livery cabs, there is a meaningful need for cab service in Jackson Heights â€“ otherwise the livery cab drivers would not be here in the numbers they are.&nbsp; In particular, people who cannot afford cars or who choose not to drive appreciate having this service available for occcasions when walking or public transport is not feasible -- <br /><br />Actually, although I might be biased as a non-driver myself, I think that one of the main reasons our streets are so congested is not livery cab drivers, but the fact that far too many people use private cars.&nbsp; Cabs would also seem to be more environmentally friendly than cars given that most of us use cabs selectively whereas people who own cars tend to use them routinely...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				I would love to see some kind of dispatch service near the Roosevelt hub. <br /><br />Bus transit and walking aren&#039;t always the necessary solution for many - and the people who need a cab after getting off the subway likely don&#039;t have a car parked nearby (or they wouldn&#039;t be looking for a cab).&nbsp; If licensed taxis aren&#039;t willing to drive around here looking for fares (there are plenty of taxis that visit off-duty for groceries, restaurants, etc., but obviously they can&#039;t make enough money to pay for their shifts here) the livery cabs should be able to serve the taxi-transit needs of this area. <br /><br />They already are doing so, but because there&#039;s no livery-taxi-stand(s) for them to do business legally, they just drive around and around, looking for fares that way. The TLC turns a blind eye on this practice, but doesn&#039;t allow for livery stands....so all of us just get additional traffic congestion around an already traffic-choked intersection.

				It seems to me that DOT and TLC are caught in a catch 22 here. Yellow cabs don&#039;t serve the needs of local residents because they do not make enough money off the short trips to justify their expenses etc. By and large they serve Manhattan simply because volume is higher and the likely hood of a worth while trip is higher too. Yellow Cab owners pay a hefty price for their medallions which allow them to pick up and discharge passengers anywhere in the city they want legally. This is technically an exclusive right granted to them, keeping the competition down. Since the city grants this right to medallion holders, it can&#039;t create a space that legitimizes a practice this is technically illegal and cuts in to the right granted yellow cabs by virtue of the medallion they pay for. <br /><br />Even making an official exception for areas like ours that are under-served by medallion cars sets a precedent for other areas all over the city that would cut sharply in to the medallion cab privilege. <br /><br />So the currently &quot;solution&quot; is to simply not enforce the current laws allowing for gypsy cabs to pick people up in &quot;outer - borough&quot; (I HATE that term) areas like JH etc. But enforcing that law every now and then when the volume of gypsy cabs in a given area gets too high. <br /><br />Once upon a time, there used to be a Taxi stand on the north east corner of Broadway and 75th St. where there is now a bus stop (I believe it&#039;s the Q53). If you look closely at the ground you can still see the yellow &quot;Taxi Stand&quot; words there. I recall getting a yellow cab there once a long time ago to take me to JFK. <br /><br />Perhaps, a taxi stand could be re-created for yellow cabs, and the culture of non-enforcement could allow for gypsy cabs to line up there rather than cruise around. This might also make it easier for TLC to spot check drivers and make sure they are on the up and up. <br /><br />Alternatively, an enterprising car company could open up in one of the empty MTA venues and provide radio car service, so one could walk in and request a car on the spot, which would avoid breaking the law all together.

				One potential solution for the City/TLC â€“ which I believe has been floated in the past â€“ is to maintain the existing yellow cab/medallion rules for Manhattan below 96th Street (in which the number of medallions issued is strictly limited) but open up the market to livery cabs in all of the other boroughs.&nbsp; <br /><br />The TLC could then introduce licensing/regulatory requirements for operation of cabs outside of Manhattan â€“ thereby providing basic regulatory oversight -- but not limit the number of medallions, as is currently the case with yellow cabs.&nbsp; Presumably cab service in Jackson Heights and like neighborhoods would then be (i) legal and subject to regulatory oversight by the TLC; and (ii) more or less at the level the market demands.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />This would not seem to meaningfully dilute the value of yellow cab driver medallions given that yellow cabs ovewhelmingly focus their efforts on Manhattan anyway, save for trips out to the airports.&nbsp; And existing cab service in Jackson Heights and similar neighborhoods would be maintained but regularized, which maybe would curb some of the problems people have expressed concern about --&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				A variant on this concept that I think has merit is to bring the community cars under the same regulatory framework as the yellow cabs -- same vehicles, same regulations, same payment options -- with just a few exceptions:<br />1. Rates would continue to be negotiated instead of metered<br />2. Vehicle types would be the same as taxis, but painted a different color (most likely black)<br />3. No street hails below 96th Street in Manhattan and no taxi-line pickups at the airports.<br /><br />I would favor limiting the number of these second-tier medallions, but setting the cap much higher than the medallions for the yellow cabs.&nbsp; <br /><br />This would enable the city to transition the community cars away from gas guzzlers and toward cleaner (and more accessible) vehicles like the rest of the taxi fleet.&nbsp; In exchange, by limiting supply somewhat, it would help reduce the overpopulation of community cars and help make them more profitable for each individual driver.

				I like this idea with one caveat:&nbsp; <br /><br />Medallion concept seems a little problematic â€“ what seems to have happened with yellow cabs is that existing medallions are bought and sold at extremely high prices (hundreds of thousands of dollars I believe) which I understand is mostly attributable to strict limits on medallion supply imposed by TLC.&nbsp; This in turn creates high entry barriers for anyone looking to enter this business â€“ <br /><br />Think that for non-Manhattan cabs, TLC could and should establish some basic safety and environmental protocols â€“&nbsp; including exams, inspections for drivers, vehicles etc â€“ and issue licenses, which would be personal and limited to the individual or company applying.&nbsp; If TLC wanted to limit the number of drivers or cabs for traffic or environmental reasons, it could simply limit the number of licenses issued with no need for medallions. (Although I donâ€™t necessarily think itâ€™s a good idea to limit the number of cabs â€“ in an essentially urban area like Jackson Heights, maybe limiting private cars is a better way to goâ€¦.) <br />

				Just last week I took a yellow cab from work (Manhattan) to JH around 2 am. I love that yellow cabs haul butt when they are forced to go to Queens. He was cruising down a desolate 37th Ave when he got stuck behind an empty livery cab going 5 mph for no discernible reason. Despite honking and tail-gating, the gypsy cab would not pull over. My yellow cab manages to go around him and drops me off at a red light. The livery cab, feeling offended, floored it and went through the red light just to cut off my cab out of spite.

So J &amp; R asked the city if they could create a taxi stand in front of the store and, to sweeten the deal, offer free coffee and unlimited bathroom visits for drivers.In the technology section of the store, downstairs near the returns and the tech support, are four bathrooms that are cleaned once an hour. And chairs nearby to wait if theyâ€™re occupied. Brown said not allowing the drivers free access wasn&#039;t an option. &quot;Once you do it, you do it the right way. It would be very unfair to invite them to stop by here and not to be able to use the facilities.&quot;TLC Commissioner Yassky hopes the idea takes hold. &quot;We are very delighted by J &amp; R stepping up and setting an example here. I would love to see other businesses follow suit.&quot;

				<strong>New York Daily News</strong>:<br /><br />New livery cab law in outer boroughs finally makes New Yorkers out of &#039;bridge people&#039; (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/06/29/2011-06-29_all_hail_new_livery_cab_law_in_outer_boroughs.html)<br /><br />The so-called &quot;bridge people&quot; - New Yorkers who, like me, live in the outer boroughs and upper Manhattan - have high hopes of finally feeling a little less like second-class citizens.<br /><br />That&#039;s because for the first time we will be able to legally hail a livery cab.<br /><br />But only if Gov. Cuomo signs into law a bill that, after months of debate, was approved by the Legislature last week legalizing street hails for livery cabs. Cuomo hasn&#039;t taken a position on this issue yet.<br /><br />&quot;I applaud the New York State Legislature for passing this bill,&quot; said Councilman Ydanis RodrÃ­guez (D-upper Manhattan).<br /><br />&quot;This is a win-win situation as people who have the financial resources to buy a [yellow cab] medallion will be able to do so, and our working-class livery taxi drivers, who have provided much needed services to this city for decades, will now for the first time in history be allowed to legally respond to street hails.&quot;<br /><br />As the law now stands, only yellow cabs are authorized to pick up passengers on the street, because allowing livery cabs to do the same would, supposedly, take business away from yellow cabs.<br /><br />To get a livery cab, you have to call the livery company (or base), then a dispatcher contacts a driver, who then picks you up. Imagine Manhattanites doing all this to get a cab.<br /><br />[Click above link for complete article.]

				I see the good in this, I do, but part of me feels this would just let livery cabs in our neighborhood drive even slower when they&#039;re cruising for fares- holding up traffic, honking at people who aren&#039;t even hailing them, etc. <br /><br />Does anyone else feel this way?

				I think it&#039;s a great idea.&nbsp; Did you know that some livery drivers who pick up street hails are arrested and arraigned in criminal court.&nbsp; They&#039;re put through the system along with the murderers.&nbsp; What a waste of resources.&nbsp; This bill will allow drivers to pay a fee to the city and legally pick up fares.&nbsp; You&#039;ll know which cabs are eligible because they will be painted a certain color. I assume that they will have to meet certain standards such as insurance.&nbsp; I see it as a win/win.

				Yellow cabs don&#039;t honk for fares because they have lights on top indicating their availability.&nbsp; Now the new outer borough cabs will, too.&nbsp; I think legalizing outer borough hails for non-yellow cabs will reduce the annoying behavior you referenced, while simultaneously making it easier and cheaper to get a ride.
