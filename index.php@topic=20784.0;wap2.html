			<br />
			Can anyone recommend an art/sculpture restoration studio in Queens or Manhattan?&nbsp; I have several projects in need of loving care -- not looking for &quot;museum&quot; quality, just family &quot;heirloom&quot; quality.&nbsp; The projects include restoration of an 8x8 stone sculpture (pieces broken off during a move) and an organic material piece of art which fell and broke into several pieces. Any leads are much appreciated!
