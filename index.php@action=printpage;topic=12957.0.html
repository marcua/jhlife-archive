				As a classmate of Barbara Maris, I always wanted to tell her when she took a &quot;demerit for me&quot; that I deserved in Mr. Hartstein&#039;s class (the year where he turned white one day in November when a teacher whispered in his ear that Kennedy was just shot), that, that was the nicest thing anyone&#039;s ever done for me.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I never saw her after June 1964, she didn&#039;t go to JHS 145, and other than thanking her briefly as an 11 year old in that class when that incident had occurred (don&#039;t remember the date), never really got to tell her how much that meant to me. If anyone stayed in touch with her over the years, please tell her Michael never forgot her kindness.
