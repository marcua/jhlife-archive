				On September 11, 2001, when I finally made it home to 73rd street, one middle easterner came up to me and said &#039; Isn&#039;t it a great day ? &#039;.&nbsp; I was furious!&nbsp; &nbsp;That night a large group was celebrating with music and drinking in front of one of the houses on 73rd street which has been since replaced.&nbsp; &nbsp;The police were called and the FBI was also called.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Not wish someone is dead?&nbsp; I can understand your comment, but in this case, I think more should have been done instead of dumping his body in the ocean for buriel because of his religion.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				?&quot;I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy. Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.&quot; Martin Luther King, Jr<br />

				interesting, Birch. don&#039;t buy that tale in the least.<br /><br /><br />there aren&#039;t all that many middle eastern born people around these parts, and my pakistani and bangladeshi &nbsp;neighbors were mournful in the wake of 9-11-2001 -- to the point that we had more dialogue than ever.<br />&nbsp;<br />and i refuse to rejoice in the death of another, because i do not care to soil my soul. to take pleasure in death makes one evil. i am not saying death is not sometimes deserved. in bin laden&#039;s case, it most certainly was. i accept that and move on. if i were to get giddy and dance? i&#039;d be on the road to hell.

				i will have to defer to you guys on seeing celebrations....i lived at 35th and 75th at that time and saw/heard nothing of the kind. and as i said, when i talked to my neighbors -- four different families -- in the two or three days later, i heard nothing but shock and sadness. but obviously, i didn&#039;t talk to everyone in the neighborhood.<br /><br />i still stick to my feelings about this round of celebrations, though.

				News today said the MLK quote was false. Someone put commas or quote marks in the wrong place in the Atlantic.<br /><br />Trivial to the issue, but interesting.
