				that surveillance video they showed on NY1 was terrifiying. it pierced that windshield like a javelin. the driver was so fortunate that it wasn&#039;t a little further over.<br /><br />and the statement that the stuff had been stored there for &quot;years&quot;? that&#039;s a winning lawsuit, and i hope it happens -- even though i am the least litigious person out here.

Takes me back to my early days in NYC, when falling chunks of building facades struck so many people, I became afraid to go outside.
