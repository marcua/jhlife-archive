				Speaking of the Amish Market, does everyone know about the one in Atlas Park?<br />For that matter, does everyone know about Atlas Park? We went there last weekend and while most of the shopping was averge, the cinema and the Amish Market were great finds!<br /><br />We&#039;ll have to check out the FoodCellar next. It looks just like Whole Foods.

				What would be the best way to drive to the FoodCellar?&nbsp; I checked on google maps and it sends me on Northern Blvd almost the whole way.&nbsp; Guess this is ok but sometimes Northern seems really slow.<br /><br />I always feel like the trip to Trader Joes/Amish Market is kind of a trek too (yes, even though I have a car).&nbsp; Maybe I just have never gotten used to Queens traffic.<br /><br /><br />edited to say. . . maybe I don&#039;t really need to know how to drive to FoodCellar after all.&nbsp; After reading the comments on the blog chuckster linked to, I&#039;m afraid I won&#039;t be able to afford the prices.<br /><br />example comment from the blog<br />prices are pretty outrageously high, and you are right, weâ€™re not talking just a few cents here. <br /><br />however the salad bar is $8/lb at whole foods also and the produce is about the same. packaged goods are way overpriced by about 10 to 30% across the board. i guess some folks can afford this, but i am not paying $12 for two chicken legs. iâ€™d rather go elsewhere (even if i donâ€™t get a smile) and save a couple thousand dollars a year.

				Shelby, I was reading another article about FoodCellar and the writer said that the market stocks a lot of organic merchandise.&nbsp; This can explain some of the higher pricing I suppose, but $12 for two chicken legs?&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to do some comparison pricing with:<br /><br />FoodCellar<br />Whole Foods<br />Fairway<br />Fresh Direct<br /><br />I&#039;ll go ahead and assume that these stores carry similar products.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty curious, so I&#039;ll probably take a ride down to FoodCellar to check it out at some point.&nbsp;

				If the prices are exactly the same as Whole Foods I would still go occasionally and just be judicious about what I buy.&nbsp; But if the blog commenters are right and the prices are even higher than Whole Foods.. . .well, it&#039;s not really worth the drive over there.<br /><br />But I shall try to withhold judgment til I can make it over there myself.

				The <strong>New York Daily News</strong> has an article on FoodCellar.&nbsp; According to some shoppers, the pricing is considered high even by Manhattan standards and some items may be priced higher than at Whole Foods.&nbsp; Shoppers in the Long Island City neighborhood seem to like the store so far regardless of pricing.&nbsp; They&#039;re calling it a high-end market and they welcome it into their community.<br /><br /><strong>New York Daily News</strong><br />New market Food Cellar &amp; Co. opens in Hunters Point (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2008/08/18/2008-08-18_new_market_food_cellar__co_opens_in_hunt.html)<br />BY JOHN LAUINGER<br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER<br /><br />Monday, August 18th 2008, 9:01 PM<br /><br />Attention Hunters Point shoppers - your supermarket has finally landed.<br /><br />The up-and-coming neighborhood got its first grocery store last week when a market debuted in Queens West, the megadevelopment that is transforming the Long Island City waterfront.<br /><br />Food Cellar &amp; Co. Market opened Wednesday on the ground floor of a posh residential building on Center Blvd. - near the Pepsi-Cola sign along the East River.<br /><br />The opening of the upscale store comes after years of complaints from pioneering residents who have had to travel to Manhattan, other parts of Queens - even cyberspace - to fill their cupboards.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s nice to have something right here instead of having to go to the bodegas or use FreshDirect,&quot; resident David Baker, 31, said while exiting the store.<br /><br />Several shoppers said the store has a good selection of organic and premade foods. But nearly everyone told Queens News that prices were steep - even by Manhattan standards.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a nice store with high quality products - but you pay for it,&quot; Brenda Pech, 30, said while perusing produce with her 4-month-old daughter, Sophia.<br /><br /><strong><em>Follow the link above for complete story.</em></strong>

				I stopped by Food Cellar for a short while this weekend and confirm that pricing is higher...at least on products that I normally would buy.&nbsp; On average, I&#039;d say that prices are approximately $1.50 to $2.00 higher than what I pay for similar items at Fairway in Redhook or Met Food on 37th Ave.&nbsp; For instance, a box of Nature&#039;s Path Oat Bran cereal was priced at $4.99 at Food Cellar.&nbsp; I pay $3.19 at Fairway, possibly less at Trader Joe&#039;s.&nbsp; The 1/2 gallon container of Silk Soy Milk is $4.99 at FC, $3.49 at Fairway.&nbsp; A 30 oz. container of Utra Downy is priced at $6.99 at FC.&nbsp; Met Food price is $5.79.<br /><br />I purchased 1/2 lb. of two different deli meats (turkey breast and ham), 2 Rosemary Focaccia sandwich rolls and a 1/2 lb. of pre-packaged chicken curry salad.&nbsp; The total was $18.49.<br /><br />These are just some quick examples.&nbsp; My visit was very brief.&nbsp; What I also noticed is that the market is still not stocked completely.&nbsp; There remain many empty shelves.&nbsp; There also seems to be a large focus on organic food products and earth friendly items.&nbsp; The deli section only carries Applegate Farms meats.&nbsp; No Boar&#039;s Head to be found here.&nbsp; The guy behind the counter said that it&#039;s because the owner wants to offer healthier and organic selections rather than meats loaded with additives and nitrates.&nbsp; The fruits and veggies are gorgeously displayed.&nbsp; One guy was looking at the bananas and commenting on how beautifully perfect they appeared.&nbsp; The market in itself is not as large as Whole Foods.&nbsp; I&#039;d say that it&#039;s about the size of a typical Trader Joe&#039;s.&nbsp; Another interesting observation is that while many people roamed the aisles, the register lines were empty!&nbsp; Maybe they were also involved in reconnaissance duty!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Food Cellar also offers tables and seating for its customers that stop in for a quick bite.&nbsp; There are hot and cold food items and they also serve up brick oven pizzas.&nbsp; By the way, the pizza is made to order and looked delicious.&nbsp; Someone had ordered a personal pie that was just fresh out of the oven.&nbsp; Very tempting!&nbsp; I believe the small pies were priced at $10.00 with additional fees for toppings.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be shopping for groceries at Food Cellar.&nbsp; At best, I may stop by for a mini pie so that I can enjoy eating it by the docks overlooking Manhattan.&nbsp; Nice view!<br />
