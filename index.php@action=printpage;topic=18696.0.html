				Shorewalker’s 34th Annual Great Saunter on May 4, 2019 Open for Registration<br />The Shorewalkers organization has announced registration for their 34th annual urban hike<br />around Manhattan, the Great Saunter, is now open. Held on the first Saturday of May since its<br />inception in 1985, this unique event was created by Shorewalker’s founder, Cy Adler to raise<br />awareness about New York City’s waterfront and support efforts to build and preserve its open<br />spaces, as well as promote good health through walking. Cy passed away in September 2018 at<br />the age of 91, and an obituary about him was featured in the New York Times.<br />The Great Saunter draws walkers from around the globe who love the challenge presented by<br />the 32-mile distance as well as the opportunity to discover little known areas of New York City.<br />In 2018, 1597 registered for the event, representing 28 states &amp; 6 countries with 729<br />completing the full course.<br />While the waterfront has changed considerably since 1985, the route has remained the same,<br />excepting road closures or construction and Shorewalkers is committed to its preservation and<br />development into green spaces as exemplified in this CurbedNY article.<br />The event begins and ends at the historic Fraunces Tavern on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan<br />with start time of 7:00am and at an average pace of 3 mph, finishing at 7:00pm. The route<br />heads north from Battery Park through Hudson River Park and the Hudson River Greenway past<br />the George Washington Bridge on up till Inwood Park, then travels south along the Harlem &amp;<br />East Rivers, past 9 bridges, returning back to Fraunces Tavern.<br />A map with mile markers, water stations and rest stops is provided each registrant and<br />certificates are provided to all who complete the route and the event is held rain or shine!<br />Registration for the event is $25 for an individual and $40 for a family with group rates also<br />available. The registration also includes a full year membership in the Shorewalkers<br />organization, which leads over 100 walks in the tri state area throughout the year.<br />

				We completed this last Saturday.&nbsp; It was very challenging to finish but a great experience.&nbsp; So much about Manhattan that we never have seen and a great time walking for eleven hours with our friends.&nbsp; Don&#039;t underestimate how difficult it will be but do try it next year.&nbsp; We&#039;ll likely be there.
