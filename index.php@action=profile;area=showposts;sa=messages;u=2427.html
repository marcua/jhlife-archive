					These a few more places that I recall - El Inca resturant on Roosevelt Ave and I believe 86th street. That had this one dish El Inca potato soup that was out of this world. Whenever a customer took a cigarette out a waiter would be there to light it up before it even touched the person&#039;s mouth. <br />It might have been mentioned but Clappers was the very fine clothing store on 82nd street which later moved to I believe Junction Blvd.<br />Of all the many different supermarkets in our neighborhood - I always thought that that Dan&#039;s on Northern was the best of all.<br />Wasn&#039;t there a huge outdoor fruit and veggie market called Top Tomato on Roosevelt avenue?<br />On Northern Blvd there was a nice seafood resturant called Martha&#039;s Vineyard. They reopened into a larger location on Northern and also offered Chinese food.<br />The candy/newspaper store between 84th/85th street and 37th ave. has been there aloong time with many different owners.<br />Lady Algene (not sure if I spelled this correctly) was a jeweler on 37th avenue whose original owner was the spitting image of Marlin Brando in the Godfather. <br />I&#039;m sure that in the coming days several more places will come to mind.<br />

					Easier to type by starting another post.<br /><br />Some thoughts on named places.<br /><br />Both Lamstons and Woolworths had the very best Rubbermaid sections - something I used alot of back in the day. I remember that Woolworth&#039;s had a number of fish tanks on the bottom floor which my young son always liked to look at. I noticed the fish that day were floating (dead) and didn&#039;t want him to get upset. So I said to be very quiet that the fish were &#039;sleeping&#039;. He looks and me and says they aren&#039;t sleeping -there dead!! So much for protecting the innocence of a child.<br /><br />Dragon Seed was the best of the best - they had to this day the worlds greatest spare ribs.<br />Number 1 Chinese resturant had Sesame chicken whose like I will never taste again. Thye had a bullitin board listing the customers favorite dishes each week - the Sesame chicken was always on the top.<br />What a great deli Grafs was - Mike&#039;s was very good too.<br />Italian Farms which is still there had the best veal cutlets -today is it so hard to find veal cutlets due to their high cost.<br />Greco&#039;s is another place I really miss.<br />Cookie Express had the best brownies (Cafe 77 today has very good ones too) and the very best German chocolate cake. Everyone was so nice form the owner John - the baker and the counter girls -I still see Dotty with her red hair every once in awhile.<br /><br />There was a great Thai resturant on 90th street between Roosevelt and 37th ave which was my first introduction to Thai food.<br /><br />What a great trip down memory lane - the good part is that we still live in the best neighborhood in Queens!!!!

					Wonderful thread and forum. Reading thru this was lotsa fun - thx to all the contributers!!! I have lived in Jackson Heights for over 30 years - let&#039;s see if I can fill in some gaps:<br />RS91885 - I do not recall the exact name of the pharmacy you mentioned - but I remember it like yesterday. The owner&#039;s name was Steve. He actually turned the property into a very nice take out sandwich cafe which didn&#039;t last all too long. This was on the corner of 83rd and 37th.<br />I recall that Demarco furniture had two stores -the one on 37th and I believe another on Northern blvd.<br />Arts and Flowers was a wonderful shop - they supplied all the beautiful flowers for my wedding. There was another very nice flower shop called Keffas - across from Joey D&#039;s on the other side of the tresel on 82nd street.<br />For a short while next to Joey D&#039;s (or maybe at their location) was a hamburger joint with the best french fries called Checkers.<br />Really4Rob - I was waiting for someone to mention the Arthur Treachers on 82nd st. Goodness that pizza shop right by it had to be the narrowest food establishment I can recall.<br />Here&#039;s a good one - on Roosevelt Ave there was a small convienance store within a gas station - they had real chocolate milk in the bottle -late 70&#039;s early 80&#039;s I recall - those bottles of milk were a real treat. <br />There was another small toy store near that triangle on 90th street by the number 7 line.<br /><br />Marval&#039;s (not sure I spelled this one right) originally on Roosevelt avenue moved to where the supermarket Fishers used to be - near Luigi&#039;s on 84th and 37th<br />Wasn&#039;t there a small bowling alley next to Fishers?<br />On 82nd was a large jewerly store called Moniques near the 7 train. They had a sister store directly across the street.<br />Wasn&#039;t Fair the linen and glassware store on 82nd street that moved to the Middlevillage area?<br />What many people didn&#039;t realize was that in the back of the used book store there was a special room filled with really good titles. I think that you had to be friends with the owners for them to let you inside. Wasn&#039;t there always a dog in their shop?<br /><br /><br /><br />
