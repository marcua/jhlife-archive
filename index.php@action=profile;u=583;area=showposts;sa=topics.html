					<strong>It&#039;s finally here! <br />Opening ceremony and ribbon-cutting at 4:00 this Thursday (May 27)! </strong>Which means it will be open just in time for the long weekend!<br /><br />Thanks to a huge number of individuals. Thanks, Jeff - who brought this idea to the Community Board 3 years ago and started the whole thing - and the many individuals and not-for-profit groups (big kudos to JHBG) city (CB 3) and stage agencies (NYS DOT) who have given so much time and energy in making sure that this park wasn&#039;t forgotten or blocked by red-tape. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you don&#039;t already have an application, you can download one from the website <a href="http://jhdogs.ning.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://jhdogs.ning.com</a>. <br />Membership is free (although we do have a suggested donation to help cover operating expenses) and open to all - we just need to ensure that all dogs using the park are vaccinated and licensed. <br /><br />See you all there! <br /><img src="http://api.ning.com/files/nV2TDeLgN9vkP3PT5QlEn-oECyJkUbxq5*yPRTLBZGC-CP*CmUUl6NbLij1lAq7ye9w8W0CwA1FNLjdT9DT0Vjg5WnYijChU/892555482.jpeg" alt="" class="bbc_img" />

					I have $89 deducted monthly from my paycheck and receive a monthly metrocard at work. <br /><br />But I&#039;ve been commuting by bike all month, and haven&#039;t taken it out of the wrapper. Can I legally sell this card to recover part of my out-of-pocket?<br />(cash is taken out pre-tax, I believe, so there is a small tax deduction involved, which is what makes me unsure)<br /><br />Anyone know? <br />

					The NY Daily News will be doing an article on the soon-to-open dog park, and will is sending a photographer over today at 5:30 - as this park has always been a community effort, we&#039;d love to have those who can make it this afternoon join us with their dogs!<br /><br />We&#039;ve got more details here: <a href="http://jhdogs.ning.com/events/photoop-for-the-daily-news-at" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://jhdogs.ning.com/events/photoop-for-the-daily-news-at</a> <br />And if you can, RSVP on the dog park site, so we&#039;ll have an idea of how many people to expect!<br /><br />(I&#039;ll also have a stack of membership applications/park rules with me)<br />

					I used to live across from a great little guitar store in Manhattan, and would just run across the street and have any work and setups done there. Anyone know a good guitar tech here in JH or nearby? Who do local musicians go to? I just want to have a basic setup done, and don&#039;t really want to drag my guitar into Manhattan and back.

						<span class="smalltext">&#171;&nbsp;<strong>on:</strong> September 13, 2009, 06:54:01 PM&nbsp;&#187;</span>

					I have only lived in Jackson Heights for a short time&nbsp; -- we went into contract to buy our apartment last August, and closed in January â€“ so my experiences may differ from longer residents, but I have run into Danny Dromm a few times in my short time in Jackson Heights, and thought Iâ€™d share them with everyone. I moved from Manhattanâ€™s district 3, but never ran into Ms. Quinn during her entire tenure as our city council member there â€“ so itâ€™s surprised me that Iâ€™ve run into Mr. Dromm as many times as I have. <br /><br />To be clear, I donâ€™t work for his campaign in any capacity. <br /><br />Originally, weâ€™d expected a fast close in Late September/early October, but as the banking system collapsed, one thing or another came up with our mortgage and our closing kept being delayed. For a time, it appeared that weâ€™d be moving just before the November elections, and I absolutely wanted to make sure I could vote for President if Iâ€™d moved. I was unsure on exactly what I would need to do to vote if Iâ€™d moved in the time between the registration deadline and election day. I stumbled across Mr. Drommâ€™s website as district leader through a websearch, and I sent him an email asking about my situation. He replied that he didnâ€™t know, but would call the board of elections, and let me know. Two days later, he sent me a detailed email with the BOEâ€™s affidavit procedure, and what to do if the election workers werenâ€™t sure how to do this. <br /><br />I ran into Mr. Dromm again at a friendâ€™s housewarming party, someone (one of two of my friends here in JH) who grew up in schools with Mr. Dromm involved in some capacity. We chatted briefly, and I thanked him for his help the previous fall. We mostly chatted about arts in the public schools, since my day job is working for a theatrical licensing company that has a program with the city schools district to bring self-sustaining theatre programs to schools without. <br /><br />Some of you on this board may know that Iâ€™ve got a big dog, and am very interested in doing whatever I can to make sure the dog run gets built. I ran into Mr. Dromm again at a community board special meeting focused on helping to make the dog park a reality. Mr. Dromm was very helpful in keeping that meeting moving forward, and in providing advice to the dog park group on best ways to move forward. <br /><br />I went to the Transportation Authorityâ€™s planning meeting on improving congestion and quality of life issues in eastern Jackson Heights this summer, and again Mr. Dromm was there, participating as a citizen of the neighborhood, and also listening to peopleâ€™s concerns about the traffic/congestion/noise in the 73rd Street area. <br /><br />Later this summer, I saw Mr. Dromm again at the Anti-transgender Violence rally held in July on the steps of the post office, along with many other city council members, candidates from other districts and many activists. <br /><br />In addition, his involvement with the Queens Pride Committee and the Queens gay pride parade are very encouraging to me. One of the reasons we chose to move to Jackson Heights was the comfort we felt in this neighborhood as a gay couple â€“ a feeling of relative safety we did not feel in many of the other neighborhoods we started looking at when we decided to leave Manhattan. That there is a pride parade, and the fact that our public officials refuse to tolerate hate crimes of any kind in this neighborhood is incredibly important. <br /><br />Now, I have nothing bad to say about any of the other candidates. Iâ€™ve never met them. Nor have I had the opportunity to attend any of the candidate forums or debates, as my job kept me in Manhattan too late to attend. But in the limited civic involvement I have had since moving to this neighborhood Iâ€™ve run into Mr. Dromm several times, and every time was a positive experience. My momma used to say, â€œhalf of life is just showing up.â€ And Mr. Dromm has show up. <br /><br />And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll be voting for Mr. Dromm on Tuesday. <br />

					I have a friend coming to visit who&#039;s asked me to scope out where to find Koji (the mold culture used to create miso, among other things) - I have no idea - does anyone else know? I suppose I could try the Korean grocery on Roosevelt/72nd and Pacific Foods on Broadway/75th, but perhaps someone here may know exactly where to go?
