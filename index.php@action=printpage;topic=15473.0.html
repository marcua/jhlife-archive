				I was walking this morning and saw a new little cafe/bakery on 80th, between roosevelt and 37th. I think it&#039;s just opening today? The sign is generic- it just says &quot;NYC Coffee.&quot; Signage indicates they have coffee and matcha. The owner was out front and he said that they&#039;d be serving a variety of onigiri/rice balls, and it looked like they had some pastry-type offerings in the case. He said that they make all the onigiri on site. <br />anyway that&#039;s all I know but I plan to go back and grab a matcha at some point...<br />

				picked up a few of the onigiri this morning, and they were excellent. a few different kinds, including the traditional Spam one that&#039;s not as common here as in Japan or Hawaii. $2.50 a pop, a great deal.

				I&#039;m probably in the minority, but I wouldn&#039;t want to live next to that. Take an apartment, and add the most concrete, ugly awnings and gates everywhere you possibly can,&nbsp; and turn it into a restaurant.

				The owner said the name of the cafe is also his name, which is Oda Mitsumine. The card, as mentioned, also says 969 NYC coffee. <br />Name aside- love this place! salmon onigiri was delish, as was the matcha latte. I appreciate that there&#039;s no debit/credit card minimum- I love Espresso 77 for example, but often i&#039;m deterred from stopping in for a quick coffee because I don&#039;t have any cash on me and they have a $10 card min...

				I&#039;d like to retract the comments I made earlier if I may. Although it&#039;s not my style, it is what it is. I happened to have a matcha and chicken onigni and sat outside today, and it was lovely.

				I stopped by today for a&nbsp; salmon onigiri and loved it.&nbsp; I like the idea that you can sit outside. It&#039;s like being on a terrace and having site of the #7 made it feel funky to me.&nbsp; I see what was meant though about the awning that goes to the street. I bet if the owner put some green plants outside it would really soften it up a bit.&nbsp; I really enjoyed it and will be going back.&nbsp;

				We love this new cafe, have tried four different onigiri in the past few weeks and plan to work our way through the whole menu! Matcha latte was yummy too! The owner is super friendly and kind. The new quick snack/lunch/dinner spot for this on-the-go family! Everything is fresh and flavorful and quality, give it a try, you&#039;re going to love it! :) ;D

				My husband and I went here on Sunday. Our iced matcha and hot matcha lattes were really good and the onigiri were tasty. <br />The owner is very nice and good humored, you definitely feel right at home when you go in. It&#039;s a nice, chill spot to get a snack in.<br /><br />He&#039;s offering miso soup as well. He gave us a free cup to try, and I felt it was better than what I normally get at sushi places. He also sells some western-style pastry (there were croissants and apple turnovers in the case) which looked <em>okay</em>. I hope he&#039;ll consider stocking Japanese pastries instead, like melonpan.

				I stopped by for dinner yesterday and couldn&#039;t be happier about the new addition to the neighborhood. We had the spam, salmon, tempura and tuna onigiri - they were all delicious and nicely seasoned. At $2.50 - $3 a pop, they were affordable too. Oda, the owner, made us the onigiri from scratch. The miso soup and matcha were great too. Spoke to Oda, who is thinking of adding dishes like ramen to the menu, which I strongly encouraged him to do!

				He added ramen to the menu this week and it is delicious! Only $8 for the bowl - nice tonkotsu broth, al dente noodles, good amount of chashu and boiled egg. He also makes some sushi rolls. <br /><br />

				honestly one of the most interesting, surprising and fun new places in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Oda puts his heart into his (mostly) one-man operation and does it well.&nbsp; And the food is great.&nbsp; And he&#039;s friendly, interesting, conversational and a bit of a mad scientist.&nbsp; Not a prime location so all the more worth seeking out and discovering.&nbsp;

				Oda seems to be expanding the menu quickly. the sushi options have really ramped up in the past couple of weeks and today, after a week&#039;s absence, i found about four or five new pre packaged cooked options on rice. yay!

				Oh yeah! What a great write-up. Oda brings something really wonderful to our neighborhood, and it&#039;s great to see his place get the attention.&nbsp; I love his ramen--it&#039;s the best deal in town. And I loved reading Ligaya Mishan&#039;s description of the broth: &quot;a creamline lushness from simmering pork bones, chicken bones and fish heads for eight hours (“at least”) with kombu and a head of garlic (“don’t skin it”), and leavening contours of onion, carrot and apple&quot;.<br /><br />
