				I asked the very same question not too long ago.&nbsp; Not one person responded.&nbsp; I just assumed that the people who visit this website do not have any recommendations, i.e., all the neighborhood dry cleaners are mediocre.&nbsp; I had bad experiences at Black Tie II French Cleaners.&nbsp; One time I asked them if they could mend a sports jacket where some of the stitching was coming apart around the shoulder area.&nbsp; I asked them if they could handle it or if they recommended a master tailor.&nbsp; They said they could handle it.&nbsp; What they returned was incredibly substandard.&nbsp; The stitching style was different than the rest of the jacket and it looked like an amateur worked on it, i.e., it was not aligned properly.&nbsp; Another time, they ironed a tie where the inside of the tie was not properly laid out and this created a crease that does not go away on the bottom of the tie - the tie cost almost $100.&nbsp; I tried Unit Cleaners and asked if they could get wrinkle out of the tie out, they assured me they could.&nbsp; When I got the tie back, it was all disfigured - the bottom of the tie almost seemed round - and the crease was still there.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I do not think that the neighborhood has reliable dry cleaners.

				I like the cleaner&#039;s near the corner of 37th and 85th. Lucy is a fine tailor and very reasonably priced. I have taken numerous pieces there in the eight years I&#039;ve lived in JH and was always pleased with the results.

				There are two cleaners on 37th near 85th - pretty much opposite each other across the 37th. I use Kelly Cleaners on the north side next to the health food store.&nbsp; As a cleaner, they are adequate.&nbsp; Any tailoring I have had done there has been very good.

				Hey! Quaker Cleaners on 35th Avenue at 72nd Street is my go-to in the neighborhood. I have kinda weird measurements, so the tailor has to mend my clothes pretty often, and he&#039;s amazing. He&#039;s made some of my worn-out vintage finds into serious Looks. I get clothes dry-cleaned there a lot, too.<br /><br />The owner (I think), Jaime, is very friendly and offers really affordable prices. Definitely check it out!
