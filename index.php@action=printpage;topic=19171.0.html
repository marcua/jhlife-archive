				Really enjoyed the recent thread on $8 lunches in the neighborhood (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=18812.0) and it also got me wondering wondering (particularly as I have a foot injury meaning I&#039;m stuck working from home at the moment) what are some good options to order food for delivery?<br /><br />When my wife and I get takeaway we usually order from a local favorite of ours: Sompong Thai (https://www.yelp.com/biz/sompong-thai-jackson-heights) - our usual request being Chicken Red Curry, their house salad, Sweet Sticky Coconut Rice and Roti.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to try something new though - what are your top recommendations?

				Another favorite worth mentioning is Pacific Moon (https://www.yelp.com/biz/pacific-moon-woodside?osq=pacific+moon) in Woodside - their Jalapeno chicken in particular is delicious and something a little different from what you&#039;d expect from a Chinese takeout.

				Samudra on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Indian vegetarian, but their website now seems to include meat dishes as well.&nbsp;

				It sounds like you already have a favorite Thai, but I really like Kitchen 79. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in rotisserie chicken, I like Pollo Inka Peru. However, there was a recent thread on here about chicken places recently and there may be additional good suggestions there. http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=18888.0<br /><br />Hope your foot heals quickly!

				We don’t order delivery very often.&nbsp; If we do, our first choice for Thai is Ayada.&nbsp; I also order from Asian Taste 86 Indonesian food.&nbsp; I learned a good tip from this site, basically I try to select some dishes that will be great now, today, and then I order another dish for a meal the next day.&nbsp; Some dishes are really great the next day, and it is a treat..&nbsp; <br />when I was working I would often call Samudra and place an order to be picked up at 5:45, so on the way home from the subway I would stop, pick up the order and have a terrific dinner (and sometimes lunch the next day)

				If you can, order from them by phone. I know it&#039;s convenient to order online - I like to order online as well,<br />but&nbsp; Grubhub/Seamless&nbsp; &nbsp;are REALLY shady, making fake websites without the businesses knowledge, <br />then charging huge fees. - see below.<br /><br />e.g.<br />https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19154220/grubhub-seamless-fake-restaurant-domain-names-commission-fees<br /><em>Grubhub charges anywhere from a 3 to 15 percent commission fee depending on whether a restaurant provides their own delivery fleet. However, if a customer orders from a restaurant using Grubhub’s “marketing” tactics, whether through an app search or these unassociated websites, Grubhub can bill for an additional 20 percent commission on a single order. THE RESTAURANT NEVER KNEW THESE SITES EXISTED! These fees also extend to phone orders, which Grubhub was sued over after a lawsuit alleged the company was charging commission for bogus phone calls that did not directly result in an order</em>

				Kale Mango salad with grilled chicken from El Rico Tinto can&#039;t be beat on a hot night (phone only, 718-255-6053).<br /><br />We also like to order delivery from: Sagar; Taqueria Coatzingo; Kitchen 79; Afghan Kebab and Grill (a bit pricier, but filling); sushi from East 21 or Tomo; and pasta dishes from Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; And when we want fast. cheap Chinese food, Lin&#039;s Kitchen.
