				Two thumbs up for our new Chinese restaurant Ru Yi next to CVS. Soothing atmosphere and authentic Chinese food.<br />They do take out as well.<br />At this writing they are waiting to take credit cards. <br />Definitely a welcome addition to my neck of the woods.<br />

				And true to my word, I ordered delivery tonight, and I give it a big thumbs up. <br /><br />Easy ordering, quick and friendly delivery. Here&#039;s the food rundown:<br />Wonton Soup - nothing special<br />Cucumber in Sesame Oil - excellent &amp; very spicy<br />BBQ Spare Ribs - meaty &amp; delicious, and not super sweet like most places<br />Beef &amp; Broccoli - pretty good<br />Shrimp w/ cashews - ok <br />Young Chow Fried Rice - this is a dish I really enjoyed. Most places around here make lousy fried rice, but this was done in peanut oil and it was just delicious. <br /><br />I think my lesson here is that I should venture from the traditional Americanized Chinese dishes and try their more interesting fare. They have casseroles &amp; hot plates and other stuff like pork intestines, feet, liver and kidneys (not all in the same dish.)<br /><br />I will definitely try them again.

				Dssh, they do. They delivered to us on 73 street. Food was very good. We got:<br /><br />Crisp shredded fish with chili pepper-excellent<br />beef with basil-good but nothing special<br />dry bean curd with chili- delicious<br />sauted shredded potato- very good<br />wonton soup- as Superclaim said, nothing special.<br />All in all, I was quite pleased and will be ordering from them again.

				they&#039;re generally cut the same way, with other veg but the shreds remain separate, not smashed into a cake. usually pretty spicy, thanks to the liberal use of hot peppers. not sure if this place follows the pattern.<br />http://cookingsimplechinesefoodathome.com/2012/02/113stir-fry-shredded-potato.html

				had our second delivery from Ru Yi a couple nights ago, and we couldn&#039;t be happier. genuine Sichuan dishes with no dumbing down.<br /><br />we&#039;ve had:<br />Chengdu Shrimp (head on, with plenty of sichuan peppercorns)<br />Shredded Fish with Chilii Pepper<br />Sweet Corn nuggets (imagine balls of fried creamed corn....and it&#039;s much yummier than it sounds)<br />a couple of pork belly dishes that i can&#039;t recall off the top of my head<br /><br />delivery from 90th down to 76th very fast, food still hot and - even more important to me -- the crispy items still crispy.<br /><br />not much in the way of american-chinese, but there are plenty of other places to get that. this place could hold its own in flushing or sunset park, for sure.

				I was looking at the sweet corn nuggets, I might try those next. <br /><br />Diced chicken &amp; salt fish fried rice was, not shockingly, too salty. Will get young chow fried rice next time. <br /><br />Crispy chicken wings were completely ordinary. My mistake for ordering them. <br /><br />Sliced pork w/ Garlic Sauce was fantastic. Not what I expected (I was thinking roast pork and it wasn&#039;t) but it was delicious, and even better, the kids liked it. <br /><br />Cauliflower casserole was just cauliflower cooked in a spicy sauce, but it was also very, very good and very, very spicy. I&#039;m not sure if casserole means something else in Chinese cooking or if something was lost in translation. <br /><br />I think I&#039;ll try the sauteed Chinese broccoli next time.

				Just to add to the chorus of approval for this place. We tried their recommended dishes that is the cucumber, the shredded fish and the Young Chow rice and something else that I can&#039;t recall. We liked all the dishes-they were unlike most of the take out places certainly better than our local place. We will definitely try them again. BTW the delivery time was just as good as the food.

				Since I&#039;m a total fanboy for this place, I will say I ordered from them last night. Even their ordinary stuff, like chicken &amp; broccoli is better than your average Northern Blvd place. <br />I also got the Kung Pao chicken, which was very spicy &amp; really good. I&#039;m praying this place makes it.

				I&#039;ve found it hit and miss, but that could just be my preferences. I tried the shredded potato dish, and it was very vinegary and seemed raw. I put it aside and ate the other food I ordered. I might try putting it in a frying pan and cooking it longer. Was too tired last night to bother.

				A welcomed addition to the neighborhood; much appreciated departure from the usual greasy fare one expects from &quot;hole-in-wall&quot; operations commonly found in the hood.&nbsp; At least in a pinch, I won&#039;t have to be deterred by the commute to Flushing when I get the craving.&nbsp;

				This food was so disappointing.&nbsp; WOW.&nbsp; My BBQ ribs were stringy and tough like they were over cooked and sitting around and reheated.&nbsp; My spicy bean curd entrée was not spicy -- AT ALL -- and if you eat tofu, you know when you overcook it, the inside collapses and the outside is tough.&nbsp; So second dish sucked.&nbsp; The cucumber with sesame oil... at this point, I didn&#039;t really care.&nbsp; &nbsp;I mean it&#039;s cucumber for god&#039;s sake.<br /><br />Maybe it was an off night but I don&#039;t even know if I would give this place a second chance.&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(

				Definitely sucks. Seamless says they&#039;re closed, so I guess it&#039;s true. <br /><br />I know I touted them for a long time, but I recently switched to Saw Shack. Ru Yi lost it for me with some mixed up deliveries and a strange eat-in experience. Still, they had choices not available in this part of Jackson Heights. I&#039;m sad to see them go.

				I switched to Saw Shack once they opened.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although Ru Yi food was good and had an interesting menu, I had a bad experience calling (a 10 year old girl was put on the phone to take my order) and with the delivery person--so I stopped ordering.&nbsp; With all the competition--these places need to up the level of customer service.&nbsp; Saw Shack is very pleasant in the restaurant and when they deliver.

				For what it&#039;s worth, I had dinner at this place on Oct. 9 and it was still excellent. Presentation had changed a bit (eggplant casserole wasn&#039;t served in the casserole, but it tasted the same, which is to say great). Same guy seemed to be running the place, and was as courtly as ever. Dinner was absurdly cheap, too. But as usual, there were hardly any customers. I think the problem is they are struggling to make it in what I&#039;ve been told is a cursed location, one in which several other eateries have failed. Meanwhile I would encourage others not to give up because it&#039;s the best Chinese food I&#039;ve had in the neighborhood (better than my one meal from Saw Shack) by far. Anyone with a more recent experience to report on?

				Thank you for this, because I did like their American-Chinese food when I had it, and besides Saw Shack, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a good version in Jackson Heights. <br />The gentleman (I think his name is Wilson) is indeed very cordial and polite, and I wish him luck. This is his 3rd restaurant in that space, which does indeed seem a bit cursed.

				good to hear. i&#039;ve been kind of disappointed in my last couple of orders from Saw Shack, which were much closer to typical delivery joints than the quality of the earlier meals. still ordering exclusively from the &#039;speciality&#039; part of the delivery menu, but the stuff has been greasier, sweeter, a little less bright. not terrible by any means, just kind of mediocre.

				The food I had, ribs and age tofu were slathered in thick, sugary sauce, I did not like it at all.

				I ordered from them last night. Bottom line? Ok. Fast delivery, which is always a big plus for me. All the food was fresh and cooked nicely. Chicken &amp; broccoli is my favorite American Chinese dish and this was done well, the sauce was good and the broccoli was crisp. <br />Overall, a step above the typical places in terms of quality, but I think I&#039;ll stick with Saw Shack for my Chinese food needs (which are remarkably considerable. I should figure out just how much I&#039;m spending a year in Chinese food!)

				I&#039;m not surprised; he didn&#039;t answer the phone last time I called. I wouldn&#039;t be shocked if they close within the next 6 months.

				Looks like there&#039;s a new Japanese restaurant&nbsp; on 89th and Northern called Ruyi.&nbsp; Standard fare, reasonably priced.&nbsp; Anyone give it a shot yet?<br /><br />Personally, I think we have one or two too many Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood. I also feel that way about Thai and pollo a la brasa restaurants In the hood as well, but what do I know?&nbsp; I&#039;m just one of those crazy dreamers who hopes for a nice neighborhood bar one day.

				This is the same RuYi that was once a decent Szechuan place, then a mediocre Chinese/Japanese mix. I&#039;m looking at the menu on Eat24 right now; it appears to be the same Chinese/Japanese restaurant. <br />Before it was RuYi it was &quot;Meatlover&#039;s BBQ&quot; and was fairly mediocre. There was a nice guy who ran the BBQ &amp; Szechuan place, but I believe he&#039;s not there. There&#039;s a thread about it on here. <br />Anyway, I&#039;ve tried it, and it&#039;s ok for American-Chinese, but the sushi was pretty lousy IMO. <br /><br />As far as too much Japanese, I would argue that there isn&#039;t a great, or even very good Japanese place.

				after about six months, Ru Yi stopped serving authentic Chinese food and switched to a Chinese-American menu instead. i figured since they did the authentic stuff so well, they&#039;d do credible commonplace stuff, but no such luck. no ownership change, but i guess the chefs either didn&#039;t know how, or didn&#039;t care to, cook up the standard general tso&#039;s dishes.

				The location really does seem to be unlucky. When I moved in, it was some kind of Colombian cafe, then the BBQ place, then good Ru Yi, now mediocre Ru Yi. I wonder if this place will last. The only plus it has is a nice dining room, but I&#039;ve never seen it crowded, and I&#039;ve seen it empty many times.&nbsp;

				Haha, I don&#039;t even want to imagine what &quot;Native to go&quot; is. <br /><br />The location gets some foot traffic, and the CVS is always busy, I don&#039;t know why no restaurants can make it there.

				For a comparison, Pollo Inka is directly across the street. There is no lack of Peruvian restaurants in the neighborhood, yet Pollo Inka is consistently crowded and has been for the last 3-4 years or so. Similarly, Pizza Sam, the bagel place &amp; the really mediocre Chinese place always have business.

				And to end this saga, I saw today that Ru Yi has closed. There is a sign on the rolled down gate that says Himalayan Phayul (sp?) is opening in a few weeks. That sounds familiar, are they a chain? Anyway, I wish them luck &amp; hope to try the food.

				Phayul is one of my two or three favorite restaurants in the neighborhood -- on the corner of 37th road and 74th st, 2nd floor. more a cold weather place. soups are incredible, especially this really funky cheese-based one. lots of spicy, spicy dishes. been going strong for several years. will have to ask if they&#039;re behind the new one.
