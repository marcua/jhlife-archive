				Just wanted to introduce my wife&#039;s new project: Mickey Lin&#039;s Messy Kitchen. She makes Taiwanese snacks and custom Swiss rolls. We have been selling outside Travers Park and from home. It&#039;s really good! <br /><br /><br />For Easter, she created an Easter egg hunt inside her Swiss roll https://www.facebook.com/Mickey-Lins-messy-kitchen-103975921770297 (https://www.facebook.com/Mickey-Lins-messy-kitchen-103975921770297)<br /><br /><br />The menu includes chocolate cookies, marshmallow cookies, walnut and sesame sticks (good for kids), and the Swiss rolls. She was making the custom fortune cookies but it&#039;s so labor intensive with our home oven that it is just too expensive to sell. Happy to answer any questions

				Hiya Jeff:<br />As you may already suspect from my moniker, I’m favorably predisposed towards anything Taiwanese (e.g. booming Taiwanese guttural laughter, German derivative lager, mind-blowing “Small Sausage in Big Sausage,” just to name a few). Will make it a point to stop by to introduce myself, neighbor, and best of luck in the Mrs.’ venture!

On our first date, my wife knew I was the one when I told her that I knew what that was... and liked it! Our favorite version of that is the place on Broadway with the green awning... she made friends with the owner but we can never remember the name of it. I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve tried it at Pulau Pinang, which has the best of a lot of Taiwanese things. I have learned a lot about Taiwanese culture in the past few years - it is a special thing. The snacks we sell would taste very familiar yet are exotic in name --- and that combo of familiar/exotic is always a hit. I think this has some legs. <br /><br /><br />but yeah! look out for us or order directly! Not sure when our next outing is, as we just bought a wagon, so we have to figure out our new set-up, etc. I gotta figure out signage.
