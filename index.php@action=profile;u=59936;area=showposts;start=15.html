Much as it would gratify me to see these knuckleheads nabbed in the act of speeding, a police pursuit could be incredibly dangerous to the general community.<br />There&#039;s also a pending City Council bill that would increase fines and incentivize reporting of where illegal dirt bikes are stored:<br /><br /><a href="https://abc7ny.com/atvs-motorcycles-dirt-bikes-illegal-street-vehicles/10889125/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://abc7ny.com/atvs-motorcycles-dirt-bikes-illegal-street-vehicles/10889125/</a><br /><br />Another approach I&#039;ve been wondering about is messaging. How to appeal to the sense of pride of these guys (and they&#039;re almost all guys)--how unmanly it would be to be responsible for the injury or death of a kid or older person. How most people wonder what they&#039;re overcompensating for with their obnoxious behavior (same goes for the drag race cars).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You assume that these are reasonable people. They aren&#039;t. The only thing that might (MIGHT) change their behavior is if several of them crash and seriously injure themselves. No amount of messaging is going to change the fact that they are in their 20s or 30s and don&#039;t care that their irresponsible actions may impact someone&#039;s life other than their own.

					How about a petition to reduce crime, clean up Roosevelt, or actually deal with the many other more important issues facing our community? I like having 34th Ave open and I use it all the time, but there are far more important things to deal with around here. <br /><br />I&#039;m really starting to believe that open streets has become such a hot button topic because it offers an easy way to ignore the larger problems facing our neighborhood, while still making it seem like people are concerned for the well being of the community. If as much energy was directed to the larger problems, we might actually be able to solve them. But NO, wE MusT DiReCt AAALLLL of oUr EnErgY TOWARDS 34th AVE oPeN StrEEEETs!!!!! <br /><br />You know what really causes issues with our quality of life? Bands of drunks on 82nd and in front of the post office, the human trafficking issues associated with prostitution on Roosevelt (this is well documented), illegal bars that operate in the basements on Roosevelt, 37th, and 90th, the increase in gang activity, and the fact that people like to get shooty and stabby above 90th (I know most people here don&#039;t care about that because many of you rarely cross 82nd). <br /><br />I mean, seriously; all of this is going on and the most pressing issue is 34th Ave open streets? Y&#039;all need to get a grip on what&#039;s going on around here. In short, if your main concern is 34th Ave (no matter your position) you aren&#039;t concerned with the neighborhood as a whole.

In the meantime, we shouldn&#039;t need to tolerate the various and sundry degeneracies that contribute to a substantial decline in our quality of life, especially when these people refuse help.

I&#039;ll gladly give the woman who comes by my building looking for bottles some cash a few times a week because I know that she has two children to take care for. <br /><br />These men have harassed women, and exposed themselves to everyone on the sidewalk, while making absolutely no effort to improve their situation. Do you also pity them for their lack of decency? Sorry, but these aren&#039;t people who are simply unfortunate.

					I noticed that the Burger Kink is now some sort of orthodontist&#039;s office when I walked past yesterday around 4:00PM. The drunks weren&#039;t there then, so I wonder if the new business chased them away.<br /><br />I agree with Alphabet person&#039;s assessment.

					Yeah, that worked out well. I was woken up at 1:30AM because poorly aimed Roman candles were bouncing off my windows. I called 911 (twice), but this crap continued for another two hours. I finally got back to sleep but woke up to the police calling me at 5:10 to see if I still needed assistance. Thanks a bunch 115th!

We&#039;re complaining about 82nd street, but has anyone even been to the corner of 83rd and Roosevelt? It&#039;s literally a poop-strewn toilet now. Literal poop on the walls and sidewalk.

And let&#039;s face it, they weren&#039;t all that helpful to begin with. I guess the only thing we can do is continue to put pressure on the powers that be to do something. It&#039;s exhausting though...

					Something needs to be done about this, and I don&#039;t just mean the drunks at the post office or on 82nd Street. There is also a group of men who drink outside of the grocery on 86th and 37th who like to harass women as they walk by, not to mention the skinny, moron of a drug dealer operating openly across the street (he&#039;s brought some real stand up citizens to the area). Our current elected officials (Dromm and Moya) are useless. The candidates for District 25 seem to think that the only thing that matters is OpEn StReEEEEEETS and the choices for District 21 consist of Moya (useless), someone who appears to be functionally illiterate, a domestic abuser/felon, and a social worker who seems to only want to give people good vibes. I&#039;m not convinced that any of these candidates are going to do anything to combat these issues. The 115th clearly doesn&#039;t care, and hasn&#039;t for some time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been calling 311, as well as Dromm and Moya&#039;s offices, about these things regularly (several times a week) for the better part of the last nine months with no positive results. My 311 complaints are closed within 10 minutes of me calling. Moya&#039;s office simply doesn&#039;t respond. At least Dromm&#039;s office sends a stock email.<br /><br />The end result is that we have people changing their daily routines, avoiding certain stores, and feeling unnecessarily uncomfortable in their surroundings. This isn&#039;t right and it isn&#039;t good for our community.
