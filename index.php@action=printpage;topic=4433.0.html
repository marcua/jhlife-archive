The original guys were from Astoria, then it moved to Aviation HS. Then throughout Queens, with a Chapter in Greenpoint Brooklyn and Morris Park the Bronx. I know one of the early members, but he&#039;s a cop now. He wouldn&#039;t want to talk about those days anymore . Any info you looking for ?

				Jackets ???&nbsp; Nah think you have the wrong crew. What time period are you talking about ?<br />In case you didn&#039;t know the Zoo Crew had almost 1,500 members by 1980. Like I said with a chapter in Greenpoint and the Bronx. BTW I hung out at 10 park in Astoria too. ended up playing roller hockey with tons of guys from there.
