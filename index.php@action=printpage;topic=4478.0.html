				There has to be more to this story, what idiot walks around anywhere at night with $600.00 on his person? I bet they know each other. If it was just a random mugging they wouldn&#039;t have beaten him unconscious. As for the cowards who did this they will get caught sooner or later.....

				I don&#039;t about that one line ... people in this world are crazy, beacuse, sadly, people in random muggings do get beat up badly.&nbsp; I just saw on the news tonight than an 81 year old man was beaten by some thug (whom they have on camera!) to the point that he will be brain damaged, all to have his car stolen.&nbsp;
