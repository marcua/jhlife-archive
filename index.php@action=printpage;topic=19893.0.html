				Despite the big issues of the possible end of the world as we know it life does go on. And so I have a very small question. Yesterday&nbsp; I saw what seemed to be an entirely red bird. I couldn&#039;t see a crest so I don&#039;t think it was a Cardinal but it could have been. Has anyone else seen a bird like this? Could it have been a Scarlet Tananger or Vermillion Fly catcher both of which don&#039;t appear to be native to NYC?

				I see a lot of cardinals in this neighborhood (and NYC in general)... given the angle/visibility/bird&#039;s condition - it&#039;s possible the crest wasn&#039;t clearly visible or occasionally the individual loses its crest (molting gone bad, parasites). Otherwise, could it be a house finch? They are common around here, and though I&#039;ve never seen one in JH, it&#039;s more likely than the tanager/flycatcher. Bright red (with brown) would be a male, and it is typical breeding season. <br /><br />I&#039;d be less confident about saying a scarlet tanager or vermillion fly catcher - latter even less likely. They both occur in NYC and now would be the time to see them, but our barely green neighborhood is an unlikely place to spot them unfortunately! A sure shot way to know is if you noticed black on the bird? Both these birds have substantial black plumage... the summer tanager is totally red (but again more likely around the parks/greener spots).

				There are definitely cardinals that make their home here in Jackson Heights. It seems our common garden always draws a pair who keep a nest nearby.

				Regarding birds:&nbsp; there is a bird who sings solo every morning.&nbsp; It is the first bird of the morning (about 5:30) I have yet to see it but the song is so beautiful.&nbsp; It is later joined by the chatter of sparrows, the cooing of pigeons and sometimes not often by the cawing of crows. Does anyone else hear it?

				Besides the cardinals, there are a coupla solo singers just before daybreak on our block. One is a mockingbird (<em>Mimus polyglottos</em>), with a steady series of different calls -- not surprisingly -- imitated from other birds. <br /><br />The second is the (N. American) robin (<em>Turdus migratorius</em>) with a flowing, almost playful warble. You&#039;ll also hear its singing should you ever you listen to TheBeatles&#039; tune &quot;Blackbird,&quot; as the particular (European) blackbird featured in that track also belongs to the thrush family, and both &#039;cousins&#039; have a similar song.&nbsp; :)

				i&#039;ve never seen a cardinal or a blue jay in Jackson Heights, and i love those -- even though blue jays are often jerks to other birds, come feeding time. mockingbird song, on the other hand, is pretty ubiquitous, an a lovely thing in the morning.

				There is a woodpecker that comes to the dead tree outside my window. I only saw it because I was alerted to a weird pecking sound. Cute little bird. Do they only go in dead trees?

That&#039;s great to know though<br />Dying/dead trees are preferred because they tend to have softer wood + insect haven. On the other hand, sapsuckers that look like woodpeckers, drill on a variety of trees -dead or alive.

Pretty cool. We hear them in the mornings a lot in the spring. The tapping sound is them searching for grubs and insects (as well as in early spring, hollowing out a space for a nest). They are a super useful part of the ecosystem, helping to clear trees of infestations. And if you are a home owner with a wood frame house or wooden siding, if a woodpecker is drilling in to your home it means call an exterminator! :)<br /><br />A really cool app is the Merlin ID app from Cornell. I used it to identify a female black-throated blue warbler I spotted last year in Jackson Heights. I&#039;ve been looking for a male ever since, but no dice so far.<br /><br />Here is the listing on the Cornell site for the cardinal. We have a lot of cardinals in the neighborhood. I listen for their calls to start in the spring. They are one of the first birds I notice resume their song in early spring. This year I think they started in late February. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/sounds (https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/sounds)

				Here&#039;s a site you might enjoy. <br />https://birbs.glitch.me/ (https://birbs.glitch.me/)<br />After you enter your location, they load the sound of three local bird sounds (out of 94 in the area), and give you a list of 9 multiple choices. After you pick the correct birds, it displays pictures of the three birds.

				So I listened to a lot of bird songs on the online and it is definitely a cardinal who sings every morning in a tree outside my window.<br />Such a beautiful relief against the horrible backdrop of our current situation.

				I&#039;ve been trying to befriend the mourning dove that hangs out on my air conditioner but so far no luck. I might be imagining it but I do think she is warming up to me a bit. I&#039;m attempting to entice her with little pieces of bread. A pigeon would be so much easier to work with.

				Don&#039;t know if anyone caught the segment about bird calls in our area on The Brian Lehrer Show this week.&nbsp; There were some serious bird enthusiasts and it was a really fun listen!&nbsp; (Look for Name That Birdsong! on wnyc radio.)
