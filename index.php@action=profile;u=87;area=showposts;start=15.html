					Hello fellow dog owners,<br /><br />I want to open up the discussion for services exchange, specifically<br />dog walking in this particular thread (please open another thread for<br />other types of services). In this current state of the economy, many<br />of us are holding onto our wallets a little tighter than before. I am<br />hoping that this thread can help setup a rapport between neighboring<br />dog owners who are willing to walk each other dogs when needed. I am<br />not sure if the dog walking service exchange should be tallied or not<br />as I have no experiences in bartering of services, but I imagine it<br />should be so that abuse of the system is documented. Also, I imagine<br />that good matches need to be made based on a number of factors such as<br />proximity of the dog owners, similar situations such as frequency of<br />late night work, average vacation periods, average frequency of dog<br />walking needed and non-conflicting days of the week the services are<br />usually needed. I am also suggesting that dog walkers who are matched<br />up can organize the dog walking times using collaborative services<br />like Google Docs. A shared excel document can be created to share<br />between dog walkers, friends and family so that everyone is aware of<br />time slots that are unfilled and ultimately prevents confusion and<br />accidents in the house.<br /><br />Given what I have proposed, my needs for a dog walker exchange service<br />is mainly for vacation time I have planned for early May. I am located<br />by 73rd St. and 34th Ave. In the scenario that the dog cannot be<br />walked, I will find friends/family and a dog walker if it comes to<br />that.<br /><br />If anybody has any suggestions to help make this exchange of services<br />successful, please feel free to chime in. Thanks.

Hmmmmâ€¦.. No soy sauce.&nbsp; Let me check the fridge.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp; Not even any soy sauce in the fridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />No honey.&nbsp; Donâ€™t splash the soup.&nbsp; Here, let me clean that up.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Let me call the restaurant.&nbsp; Juice?&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Let me pour you some juice.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I just ordered a delivery and there is no soy sauce.<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œAre you sure there is no soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œYes, Iâ€™m sure.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œWell please check again.â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œIâ€™ve checked again.&nbsp; There is no soy sauce.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œWell what do you want me to do about it?â€&nbsp; <br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œWell, I just ordered some California Maki, and I canâ€™t eat it without soy sauce.â€<br /><br /><span style="color: navy;" class="bbc_color">I look over and notice that the baby is waving the bowl of soup in one hand, preparing to toss it across the room to indicate that 1) she has had enough soup, and 2) that she is irritated that no one is paying attention to her.&nbsp; I rescue the soup, tuck the phone between my chin and shoulder, and take her out of her highchair.&nbsp; </span> <br /><br />Her:&nbsp; (Sarcastically)&nbsp; â€œWell donâ€™t you HAVE any soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œNo.&nbsp; I donâ€™t have any soy sauce.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; (With continued sarcasm)&nbsp; â€œWell what do you want me to do?&nbsp; Send a delivery over with soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œYes.&nbsp; That would be fine.â€<br /><br /><span style="color: navy;" class="bbc_color">Take the baby back into the living room and turn on Dora.</span><br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œYou want me to SEND A DELIVERY OVER WITH SOY SAUCE?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; (About to explode) I JUST ORDERED A MEAL THAT I CANâ€™T EAT!!!&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; Iâ€™ve had a very stressful day.â€&nbsp; And I told her a bit about MY stress, given that she had taken quite a bit of my time earlier making me listen to frustrations and computer problems.&nbsp; â€œSo yes, I would like you to send a delivery over with soy sauce.â€<br /><br />She sighs in frustration, since I am clearly a problematic customer, and agrees to send a delivery.<br /><br />At which point my neighbor comes back, and I realize that in my soy sauce crisis, I had completely forgotten that they had gotten her order wrong, and that since they were sending over another delivery, I should have gotten her the chicken tempura that she had ordered.<br /><br />I know that Tomo has gotten a lot of praise on this forum.&nbsp; But Iâ€™ve gotta tell you.&nbsp; I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be ordering up from them again.&nbsp; <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just to let you know.... the ppl there aren&#039;t actually japanese.&nbsp; They&#039;re fukinese...
