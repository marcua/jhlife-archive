				Hi all My Name s Dionisio Flores Owner at Laly&#039;s i haven&#039;t have a lot time to chat or post anything here all i want to said is thanks for all the support that we have get from all lovely people from around and fair away from Jackson heights, it is hard to keep everybody happy, but we always try our best to ,sometimes you may get confused about the concept, is very simple, the name may not be what the restaurant is ( that&#039;s what some people said ) we just love to cook&nbsp; and everything we make is always made with love from a french fry to a big meal , we spend hours to make our mole poblano , we make our own dressings, sauces, soups,our french fries , and many many other thinks, thats a reason why our prices maybe a little high but if you compare other places around&nbsp; you will see that lalys is just on average, fresh ingredients , homemade&nbsp; products, that makes the difference.<br />I know this days we are lazy to pick up the phone and place a food delivery order, (siri or alexa does everything,) unfortunately the big companies like grubhub uber eats just to mention some of them they get a lot of commision that is one of the reasons we have to increase the prices on those platforms to get a little bit profit ( i&#039;m sure many other restaurants do ) you can visit our website (lalysrestaurantny.com)or text LALYS to 33733&nbsp; and place your order directly from there and&nbsp; in partner with CHOWNOW&nbsp; you will get exactly the same service that you get with grubhub and others but at our regular menu prices.<br />So&nbsp; here we are doing what we like and making happy customers and metting new people&nbsp; every day, all&nbsp; i have to say is thanks for your support community and please let us know if you have any ideas, concerns or anything that&nbsp; will help improve our restaurant everything is very welcome&nbsp; &nbsp;info@lalysrestaurant.com all of the love for all of you&nbsp; :) :) :) :) :)DIO

				I just went Saturday with my family and we thought the quality and taste of the food was excellent. <br /><br /><br />Maybe make a different menu altogether for grubhub etc?

				Thanks for posting! The several times I&#039;ve eaten there, I&#039;ve always been impressed with the quality of the food and the service. <br /><br />Also thanks for the explanation about Grubhub, etc. I think people are gradually becoming aware that those platforms are costing the restaurants quite a bit of money. There&#039;s a Greek place in Astoria that makes postcards available when you enter the restaurant - it has a discount code if you order directly from the restaurant. In addition they have an app, so I did get the app and try to order directly now.

				Glad to see you&#039;re trying a new platform that&#039;s more attractive. Honestly, i&#039;ve never seen the appeal of services like Grubhub. The only times i&#039;ve used one - Caviar, to be specific - have been to get delivery from a place that doesn&#039;t deliver to our address (Greenpoint, Ridgewood, etc). Otherwise, it&#039;s pretty simple to pick up a phone and place an order.

				We love this place! Favorite items are the fish tacos, shrimp quesadilla, chilaquiles, and that perfect cemita. We also just tried the chorizo mac and cheese--decadent and delicious! I admittedly have been hitting the Seamless button a lot since having a baby this summer but just set up my ChowNow account and will switch over. We also have brought our baby a couple times since starting to venture out and appreciate what a relaxed environment it is. Keep up the great work!<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been to your restaurant three times and like it but I have to say the kitchen doesn&#039;t pay attention to the food.&nbsp; I have received under cooked chicken in a sandwich, salad without dressing, and a well done, pre-cooked burger when I ordered it rare.<br /><br />Get your act together if you want to succeed.

				Like the previous commenter, I had one not-good experience at Laly&#039;s, which I have to admit made me think twice about returning. I ordered the lemon chicken plate, and the chicken was so gristly and tough and un-chewable that I asked the waitperson to take it back and give me anything else. They were very gracious about it (not all restaurants are) and brought me shrimp tacos, which were fine. I&#039;ve since been back and been very happy. It&#039;s too bad, because nothing and nobody is always perfect, but one such experience can really turn you off to a restaurant. I would never order that dish again, I&#039;m afraid. Oh and the other bit of feedback--try to make any background music you choose to play innocuous. I&#039;m sometimes really bothered by blasting music I find unpleasant to endure during a meal. Overall, I&#039;m very glad Laly&#039;s is there and seems to be doing well, and will definitely go back soon.

				If you’ve seen me post on the original Laly’s thread you know I’ve lost count the number of times we’ve been. We’re welcomed like family when we arrive nowadays. Love it here.

				Have eaten there a lot. Recently, the quality has been slipping. They also need to do something about the music, i felt like i was at a nite club constantly playing house music, loudly.

				I love Lalys and everything I&#039;ve ever ordered has been excellent quality very fresh.&nbsp; The service is always excellent.&nbsp; The music has always been fine when I&#039;ve been there.&nbsp; I think live music might be a little overwhelming in that space.

				I have never noticed the music being too loud. But I&#039;m with the poster above who said please don&#039;t add live music to that space! If I&#039;m going out with friends for a meal, I don&#039;t want to have to fight to hear them over some loud live music.

				Agree about live music. We once went to Addictive for someone&#039;s birthday or Father&#039;s Day I can&#039;t recall which, and they had flamenco dancing. We were unable to talk during the entire meal--it&#039;s very loud, of course--and we have not been back there since, worried that we&#039;d be faced with more flamenco dancing. We go out for a meal and a social evening--not to see a performance.

				agree Laly&#039;s could make it work.<br /><br />flamenco dancing is a lot different than a simple set up like the one Armondo&#039;s used for years and years. one or two musicians in a side area, something like that.
