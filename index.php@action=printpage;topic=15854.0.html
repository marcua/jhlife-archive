				All 3 with 82th st lady (One of my favorite ladies, glad your still with us kid). Boy, did we have fun in those places Especially with Old Harry Martin (Rest his Sole). You would drink all night for nothing or he would charge for every drink,with no buybacks (Early Dementia I believe). If you don&#039;t believe me ask Davey A. Harry was kind of rough on the outside but a real sweet guy on the inside, I knew him well. I was drinking in that place before I was 16. With a phony draft card that is. Fond memories of drinking, dancing and occasionally fighting later at the Note (Which now I&#039;m not to proud of).

				And you have always been one of my favorites splendonsc. Sorry I didnt get to see you in December. Yes we did have fun back in the day and you are so right about Harry Martin. I forgot all about that. I too had phony proof. Mine was from a girl from the older crowd by the name of Joanie. The older girls used to call me &quot;little sister&quot;. Funny the things that come back. Buster was the bouncer and absolutely knew how old I was. So many good memories.
