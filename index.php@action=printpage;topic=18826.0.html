				The newsstand spaces at 74th/Roosevelt have been empty for a while now, and it looks like human beings will never occupy them again: the MTA is looking to replace all spaces with vending machines.<br />https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-subway-newsstands-mta-20190301-story.html

				New Technology (Robotic) Vending machines. <br /><br />Maybe they are the future for 24/7 retail stores and hence able to compete with online shopping.

				unlike the 24/7 retail stores manned by humans that they&#039;re eliminating.<br /><br />remarkably inconvenient to hand a dollar to a person. compared to waving your apple pay into the air. which will be obsolete once we get the palm microchips. 2031, in case you&#039;re keeping score. <br /><br />humans are no longer needed. they&#039;re like the appendix. bring on the nukes!

				Humans will always be needed. To stock the machines. <br /><br />Thus, in the future, we humans will work for the machines.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />However, some joy for those Amazon-haters out there...if vending machine technology keeps improving at the rate it is, Amazon will be less and less necessary! <br /><br />And then folks can complain about vending-machine behemoth corporations.

				Yeah, I have noticed that in other subway stations as well. It&#039;s really too bad--I really like having the newsstands. Ugh.

				It is sad for people to lose jobs, of course, but I am not surprised. I have never bought anything from station newsstands. I hope they fully remove the structures on platforms like GCT and Times Square to make more room for waiting passengers on these narrow, often crowded platforms.

				Job losses due to vending machines are not inevitable.<br /><br />It&#039;s simply a different business model.<br /><br />You can buy and own a vending machine.&nbsp; You then negotiate where to place it.<br />And you are in charge of re-stocking it, choosing the inventory, and collecting the cash.<br />If your vending machine does well, you do well. <br /><br />So, actually, if there&#039;s a vending machine boom, there may be more business opportunities for folks to start their own small businesses. A business which could comprise of even a single vending machine to begin with.<br /><br />And in truth, it&#039;s a far more pleasant situation than being stuck in a subway day and night.<br /><br />If a person has an entrepreneurial spirit, (which many immigrants have)... you can &quot;turn lemons into lemonade&quot;.&nbsp; And change is the chance to actualize new opportunities.<br /><br />It&#039;s the American dream.<br /><br />

				I find this very sad, and not only because my grandfather ran a subway station newsstand. Vending machines break. A newsstand with a person will always work (so long as it’s open). A newsstand with a person is a safe pair of eyes on a subway platform. And I’ll bet that items sold at a newsstand with a person will cost less than those in a machine.<br /><br />I find it highly unlikely that an individual would be able to set up a vending machine in the subways. It will be a single major corporation. Say goodbye to the $1.75 (recently $1.50) bags of Bazzini nuts and raisins.<br /><br />

Vending machines like these look fun.<br /><br />Also, if a person owns a vending machine, yes, perhaps they can&#039;t get it into a subway. As that will probably be contracted. But a smart biz person will negotiate a location that is lucrative.<br /><br />Perhaps even the lobby of an apartment building in Jackson Heights!&nbsp; ;D

Different folks have different opinions. Some on this forum are anti-gentrification. Others are less concerned.&nbsp; I&#039;m with the latter. The area will gentrify as the kids of immigrants become adults. American adults.&nbsp; That&#039;s probably around now. <br /><br />I think the Arepa Lady restaurant is the perfect example of it.&nbsp; It&#039;s gentrification. By the kids of immigrants.
