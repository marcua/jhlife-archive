				Interesting indeed. While I&#039;m with the OWS movement in spirit, the places these peaceful demonstrators should be camping out is in front of their local elected officials&#039; offices. We can only change the system when government makes the financial services industry accountable for their fraudulent schemes, and also practices good fiscal responsibility itself. <br /><br />The OWS movement is woefully misinformed, especially with their proclamation to &quot;Resist Austerity.&quot; Even taxing our corporations and &quot;the 1%&quot; up to wazoo is not going to turn around our economy, erase our deficit, or restore prosperity to the middle and working classes. Major austerity measures and cuts to social programs will have to be part of the long-term financial planning that our nation has to undertake now. No political party or presidential candidate is going to have a magic bullet that will turn our economy around without sacrifice. We&#039;ll see how seriously our current politicians take their oaths when the 12-member super-committee issues their recommendations on November 23.<br /><br />The best we can hope for is that when we are asked to dig into our pockets a little deeper, that sacrifice is proportionally and equally shared by corporations and individuals at all income levels, and that as a nation, we finally prioritize education, public health, and the environment above special interests, big industry, and the military.

So the movement is out in public as a way of raising awareness and attracting more people to the group. Only once it is much bigger could it effect the kind of change you&#039;re describing.<br /><br /><br />[<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">]The OWS movement is woefully misinformed, especially with their proclamation to &quot;Resist Austerity.&quot;[</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>]<br /><br />Not at all. They&#039;re encouraging resisting austerity as a <strong>reflex</strong>. Governments around the world have considered austerity to be the first (and sometimes the only) step towards restoring the economy. OWS is about a shifting of priorities. If austerity is necessary, let it be the last step, or somewhere further down on the list than step #1. Let it come <strong>after</strong> asking those who profited from the recent boom to pay their share, <strong>after</strong> restructuring the financial system and <strong>after</strong> reconsidering whether we should be paying to defend foreign governments from vague threats. We resist austerity now because if we don&#039;t, the powerful will simply impose austerity on the less powerful and declare the job done, their privileges intact.

				I watched the news and visited the park downtown.&nbsp; Recently my bank started to charge me for checking, since I only write a few checks each month, I was not happy.&nbsp; Thanks to Almagamated Bank I now have local, free checking.&nbsp; Consumers can change companies -look at Netfilx and Bank of America..&nbsp; People complained and they had to back down..

				Spent the day at Trinity Wall Street. Zuccotti was barren. Some Occupiers were around where I was caroling. The most peaceful and purposeful bunch you&#039;ll ever meet. I am really grateful to them for pushing our financial issues onto the world stage. <br /><br />It&#039;s also telling to see WS so locked and gated (under the auspices of anti-terrorism). In actuality, barricaded from everyman.<br /><br />Merry Hannukhristmas and a Kwanza New Year.<br /><br />Jeanette
