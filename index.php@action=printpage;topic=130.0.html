				Years, and years ago, the Readpenny Inn, 37-07 73 Street, was an Irish Bar.&nbsp; Now, it&#039;s just a bar, but you can play billiards in there....<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be nice to meet a group of posters there some Saturday afternoon, have a beer, maybe a burger, if they still have a kitchen.<br /><br />Anyone want to meet....<br /><br />Saturday, December 15th at 4 p.m.<br /><br />???

				I remember many of the old Irish bars.

				The News-Record (Greensboro NC)<br />Big Joe gives clients taste of Ireland â€” and a trim (http://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080313/NRSTAFF/892451457)<br />by Jeri Rowe<br />Thursday, Mar. 13, 2008 3:00 am <br /><br />GREENSBORO â€” Big Joe can work his crowd.<br /><br />He sits by the door in his black leather chair, cradling his coffee mug with &quot;Grandpa&quot; written across the handle, greeting everyone who walks through the door in a lilting baritone borne from his Irish homeland.<br /><br />It&#039;s really nothing new for him. Big Joe once ran a burly neighborhood bar in Queens, where men always jawed about the Mets.<br /><br />...<br /><br />At age 22, he flew to America, where he worked as a banker, a plainclothes security officer at the United Nations and, ultimately, a bartender.<br /><br />Longing to be his own boss, he bought his own place in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, a long, narrow spot with 14 bar stools and a jukebox. The Gaels Pub, he called it.<br /><br />There, he earned the nickname Big Joe. There were long hours. And near the end, there were street-corner drug dealers, too. He knew he had to get out.<br /><br />In 1994, after 21 years at The Gaels Pub, he sold the business, retired and moved south to Greensboro, the city of his first cousin, where he discovered a fondness for nice weather and nice golf courses.<br /><br />...<br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em><br /><br />(http://bjimg.sv.publicus.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=BJ&amp;Date=20080313&amp;Category=NRSTAFF&amp;ArtNo=892451457&amp;Ref=AR&amp;MaxW=250&amp;Border=0)

				The Green Blazer used to be Murphy&#039;s until Charlie &amp; Tony Canning bought it in the late 60&#039;s or so.<br /><br />The Liffey was on Broadway between 75 &amp; 76. (Officially Elmhurst I guess.) They claimed to be the bar that sold the most Guinness on tap in all of NYC. I know I contributed with a fair share of pints.&nbsp; 8) I proposed to my wife there on St. Patrick&#039;s Day in 1977. (We just celebrated our 31st anniversary.)<br /><br />Ryan&#039;s, on 83/Baxter, was the home base for the Jackson Heights Anglers in the early to mid 70&#039;s. We&#039;d head out to Montauk on a charter bus every 3rd week for the grand sum of $25 which covered both boat &amp; bus, tips for the&nbsp; mate &amp; bus driver, plus the pool for the largest fish. Beer or soda cost $.25 a can &amp; the bar&#039;s owner, Jackie Ryan, would let us take cases of the stuff on consignment.<br /><br />In the mid 70&#039;s there was also an Irish pub, actually more of a night club, in the Brunson Building for a year or two. I forget the name of the place but it featured some great Irish entertainers, including the Wolfe Tones.

				Anyone remember Gibbon&#039;s?&nbsp; It was a really big place at about 71st Broadway, I believe.&nbsp; I think it must&#039;ve closed when I was ten or so... which means just over a decade ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thinking about that place makes me happy.&nbsp; Clearly, I never had a drink there, but my dad would take my sister and I there after school sometimes and he&#039;d always buy us these really tasty chips from the bar store which was run by a amiable, vertically challenged (is there a better term?) man.&nbsp; I think my sister and I entertained the idea that he was a REAL LIFE leprechaun&nbsp; ::) . We&#039;d go for dinner sometimes too.&nbsp; I remember having my first Shepherd&#039;s Pie there.&nbsp; It was really sad when the place got closed down, but until now, I hadn&#039;t thought of the place in years.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of nice though, having places like this that live only in your memory...&nbsp; Makes them seem magical.

				I lived across the street from Gibbons. Was never old enough to get a drink there before it closed but would be int he store almost weekly buying all sorts of candy etc. <br /><br />I believe they moved to somewhere along Woodhaven Blvd. or something like that. Further out in Queens at least on the way to the Rockaways.

				Is it possible that the Blue Haven was located at what is now Duane Reade ? I believe I read here in an earlier post that many years back that location was a Jazz club. And the address seems to match.

				Thanks Aronan.&nbsp; I would imagine that a night club would occupy a larger space, so that Duane Reade plot may have some interesting history behind it.&nbsp; H.G. Wells&#039; Time Machine would definitely come in handy right now.&nbsp; If only!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				I know there was a night club on the sw corner of 75th and 37th. In the 80&#039;s it was pretty pathetic, but it may have occupied both the clothing store and the bubble tea shop&#039;s space.<br /><br />Maybe old phone books would know the answer.

				By the early 90&#039;s the Golden Note had become more of a Latin bar/club, but that was short lived.&nbsp; I do remember a club from my childhood.&nbsp; It was on the north side of 37th between 74th and 75th.&nbsp; It was part of the Bruson Building.&nbsp; It was a rock club at first, then it changed to something else.<br /><br />With respect to the Hitchcock &quot;Rear Window&quot; debate, I was told that the set designers for the movie looked at some of the old coops with the internal gardens.&nbsp; And, of course, Hitchcock himself shows up in JH in the movie &quot;The Wrong Man.&quot;

				On the gay circuit the Betsy Ross reincarnated as the Magic Touch on 37th Rd along side the Eagle theater and was there until the late 90&#039;s or early 00&#039;s.&nbsp; Also, along Roosevelt there was Billy the Kid (there was always a pool game to be had there) which was open till the late 90&#039;s.&nbsp; About the only one still open from that time would be Friends.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there were more.&nbsp; Can anyone fill in the blanks?

				The Blue Haven was located at the corner of 73rd Street and 37th Avenue. Lenny Bruce was there in 1947 when he was just starting out.&nbsp; The nightclub had a blue mirrored facade and a big circular bar, as did Dumbarton Oaks.&nbsp; Attached is a picture of the old place.&nbsp; And speaking of bars, who remembers The Orchid on 37th Avenue between 76th and 77th streets?

				<br />I lived on 72nd Street between 35th and 37th in the 50s Around the corner and down the hill was a two fisted beer and Four Roses drinker&#039;s bar with blacked out windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;. It is now Pearsons where at least five years ago you could get the best pulled pork or ribs in NY. <br />Back in the 50s for us it was just another stop on the way to the &quot;lots&quot; and snake hill the best place in Jackson Heights to sled down those twists and turns until you reached the point where your American Flyer ran out of steam.<br /><br />So what was the name of that bar which seems to be overlooked in everyone&#039;s lists?

				We typically dealt with establishments from around 79th street 71st street end of the Heights. <br />1-Have to start with Newtown Bowling on 37th between 78th and 79th across from the post office. mainly beer I recall <br />and a place for &#039;action bowling&#039; for $10 or so a game in the late hours. Irving was the owner....stout guy who put up with us.&nbsp; <br />2- Next would be the Blue Haven on 76th and 37th.... closed for a while after a raid that discovered some 26 phones in the basement... suggesting numbers, and sports bets. <br />3- The Golden Note was on 75th and 37th and frequently heavily by our group (same side as the Blue Haven)<br />4- Across the street was Albee&#039;s Bowling alley.. I knew the manager Sal I believe was his name. I was 13 or 14 probably the youngest of the neighborhood group. I knew the place when it had pinboys setting the pins. Sal would ask me to fill in when these guys typically drunk would fail to show up in the evenings. <br />5- Right next door to Albee&#039;s was the Monclair Club - probably the hottest spot in the Heights by far. Live music.. and beautiful girls dressed to the nines. King Curtis (Great Sax player) was there every Thursday. Plenty of cool luxury cars double parked out front. There used to be a fountain place on the other side of Albee&#039;s... I forget the name... but remember the 5 cent Juke Box.. and Earth Angel was the most played song. <br />6- On 74th just off 37th was another bar... whose name I just forget. <br />7- On 73rd just off 37th was Harry Martins.. owned and tended by &#039;yep&#039; Harry himself. I was able to be served there when I <br />was 14 without Id. <br />8- After I got out of the Army in 1964 (1961-64) we started a social club... the Splendon.. on 35th avenue between 71st and 72nd<br />street. It was around for some 6 or years.. and had a full bar. Though we had a NY State Charter we had no liquer license. The 110th precent left us along.. frankly happy that we were all in one place and not scattered around the neighborhood bars.&nbsp; Besides around 3 or so members were cops. Membership came from mainly Jackson Heights and some from Woodside. About 30+ members.. and a lot more who frequented the place. <br />9-Next door to the club was the Tip Toe Inn.. run by Hugo.. whose best days were during the time the club was in operation as people would drift back and forth between the Tip Toe and the club. <br /><br />Late night 4-5 AM food stops were at the Diner on Northern Blvd and around 73rd street our favorite....<br />or the Toodle House on 37th Ave and 77th street..or in some cases Bickfords.. by the Subway stop on Roosevelt Avenue.<br />&nbsp;
