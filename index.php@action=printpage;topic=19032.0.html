				Hi All! I&#039;m new to JH and just purchased a 1 bedroom. It&#039;s a nightmare and in terrible condition, as it was an estate sale so I will have to renovate everything and can&#039;t move in until I do. It&#039;s in Roosevelt Terrace and I&#039;m nervous about their strict requirements around insurances, etc. but what I want is pretty straightforward and similar to what I&#039;ve seen in the building. I&#039;ve seen suggestions here for Eddie at Corrigan Services but unfortunately, he seems too busy right now and a little too expensive. I know the perfect contractor doesn&#039;t exist but anyone you&#039;ve had success with that most importantly isn&#039;t outrageously priced would be very helpful. The quotes I&#039;ve been getting are all over the place and I&#039;m frankly at a complete loss of what do to. Any insight would be great. Thanks!

				Sorry! The contractors I&#039;ve used will be in the same ballpark cost-wise as Edie Corrigan. A gut renovation is a big undertaking, and the contractors I&#039;ve hired had to be licensed and insured for co-ops, and have a comprehensive understanding of the engineering in these old buildings, and have reputable subcontractors to handle gas, plumbing, and electrical. I found my last contractor through Sweeten, a free service that matches your budget to the contractors in their system, then you get to see and compare bids. If your project is over $10k, you can post your job and get bids. Then you can compare bids and ask the contractors questions. They often will propose ideas for areas of money savings. You will likely get one who will figure out how to work with you. And any who reply will be ready for work, so you won&#039;t be wasting your time.

				I used SWEETEN when I couldn&#039;t get Ed Corrigan to commit to a start date. The folks that did my kitchen Reno was Chris Sideris, I&#039;ll have to dig out the paperwork for contact info. The estimate was 3 to 4 weeks, they came in at 4 weeks and 2 days, which included the Labor Day weekend when we had 3 days that they couldn&#039;t work in the building (house rules).
