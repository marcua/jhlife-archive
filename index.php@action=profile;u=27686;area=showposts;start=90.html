					Thanks for the info. I will look into scholarship or financial aid options when the time comes, probably in a couple of years when my kids are ready for the school. <br /><br />My household income is probably not low enough to be qualified for financial aid, but not high enough to be comfortable to spend 16K per year on the kid&#039;s education for 12 years (which is more than the tuition for the four years&#039; college), considering the need to put away money for the 529 plan, 401K plan, emergency money and the pay the mortgage. Believe or not, one year mortgage of my current coop apartment is less than then 16K), etc.&nbsp; I think it is always about the priority and how to live below the means.<br /><br />Since the husband the wife of my family are working in the city, even with local schools (whether public or private) it is still difficult to for the parents to be at the school. On the other hand, it will be easier if the kids have schools in the city so the parents can go to the school much faster when the needs arises. I believe most schools offer afterschool program, so there is no need for a caregiver.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

					I checked the tuition for the Garden school, about 16K/year, which is probably half of the cost of a private school in Manhattan. <br />Yeah, if one can afford the 16K/year, he definitely should go for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I guess many families in Jackson Heights can not afford 16K every year or do not want to pay even they can. For those families who also want to have better alternative school than the local zoned school, testing into a good public school and long commute is probably the sacrifice the parents and the kids have to make.

					I guess most of us on this forum can not afford 1 million house anyway, not to mention the 1.5 million house. It&#039;s my understanding that even for the rich people who can afford the 1.5 million house, he still needs to make some sacrifices. If he doesn&#039;t have kids, the house is too much waste for him and he probably wants to buy coop/condo in manhattan so his commute is not even an issue.<br /><br />If he has kids, the school (either public or private) is probably number 1 issue. Forest Hills, Bayside, etc will be a much better place for the family with kids to find a single family house.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We can argue here forever about whether the house is worth 1.5 million. Eventually, it is the market (rational or irrational or bubble) that determines whether it is worth that amount of money.&nbsp; If the house is still on sale next year, then we know the house is overpriced today. If there is a buyer, then we will have a new record price for the single family house in Jackson Heights.<br /><br /><br /><br />

I guess it is not easy for them to takes photos of any mentioned apartment&#039;s interior.&nbsp; NYT didn&#039;t give the address (or a url&nbsp; as Shelby2 provided here) for the sake of privacy. While talking about the real estate, there is no privacy here. Anybody can check the names of the newly wedded couple and find which apartment they purchased by searching acris. <br /><br />I guess that NYT hunts likes to run story with interesting twists. The combination of wedding, and bidding apartments in different neighborhoods, significantly overbidding and still not being settled in the end is their formula to improve readership.<br /><br />I just purchased 2bed 2bath in a building not too different from the original couple with similar amount of their money last year.&nbsp; If you check the original couple&#039;s building, the same line 2G was sold in 2011 for $180K.&nbsp; Whatever the renovation difference or view difference between the two apartments, I personally don&#039;t think it can justify about 80% increase.&nbsp; Is the couple&#039;s price of around $330K a record price for the one bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights? Who knows how real estate can get so crazy.<br /><br />I believe Minimal4Me also moved from Brooklyn to Jackson Heights, purchased a top floor 2bedroom apartment in around 260K last year. while another couple in NYT hunts bought the an apartment around the same time in the same line for about 320K. I found that the NYT real estate always focuses on the highest purchase price to draw the readers&#039; attention. It is never their interest to talk about a really good deal what Minimal4Me had made, which will be too boring.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					Since all landlords of the commercial property are happy to see the rent go up, it would be natural to ask the commercial landlord to pay the cost. This BID is also going to benefit the resident owners too with an improved environment, so let&#039;s ask coop/condo/house owners, in additional to the commercial landlords, to pay the street cleaning cost. I&#039;m sure that the cost would be very little compared with the property tax, and with much less opposition.&nbsp; It is always that the renters have no stake in improving the environment for long term, what they care is the rent paid each month.<br />

Without seeing their financials, the high maintenance fee is probably due to doorman, a higher real estate tax (newer building tends to have a higher tax, a more popular location that is close to the express subway will be assessed with a higher value, hence a higher tax), or a higher underlying mortgage, and recent capital improvements as evidenced by their recent installation of solar panels)

When I was buying, I didn&#039;t have a choice to have my own broker (see the discussion at <a href="index.php@topic=8054.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8054.0</a>).&nbsp; As there is one major broker in jackson heights who does not allow co-brokering&nbsp; and tends to price the home higher than the other brokers (when you are looking for the apartment for a while, you will know who I am talking about), but this broker gets the inventory. I ended up buying a coop with this broker. In general, my dealing with him seems relatively smoothly. This broker is professional and you are his customer after all.&nbsp; But don&#039;t expect him to get a good price for you as he is exclusively working for the seller.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t expect that a buyer&#039;s agent is going to help me to get a good price as his primary purpose to have a deal. If the buyer&#039;s agent deems it too difficult to negotiate a good price for the buyer, he will loose the interest to work for you.<br />Here is another thread where a broker asks the seller to consider co-brokering (<a href="index.php@topic=8051.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8051.0</a>). I don&#039;t think this broker is successful to convince the seller to do this as evidenced by the fact many good apartments were sold by the above mentioned no co-brokering agency. I sort of understand from the seller&#039;s point of view (The person who can get me a better price and sells faster will get to sell my apartment, co-broking or no co-broking is none of my business).<br /><br />Anyway, after you are looking for the apartment for a while, you will have a good feeling how to price the apartment correctly. acris is good source to check the price history.

When I was living there several years ago, nobody wanted to go to the foodtown as the price was too expensive and the selection was too limited and the vegetables/fruits were not fresh (due to limited customers). <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping the change of Metfood is just rebranding (i.e., with the same kind of managements and food selection as before), not a takeover. We&#039;ll see what will happen when the change actually takes place.

					As I just bought a coop recently, my experience told me that you can offer your price you are comfortable with and then during the contract signing time, get your time to do the due diligence. Like reading the financial documents and the board meeting minutes, if you find something you are uncomfortable with, you are free to back out. You probably have to pay several hundred dollars for the attorney. Some attorneys will not charge you unless you have signed the contract. <br /><br />Of course, if the broker/seller is helpful, ask them to give you the building&#039; financials for the past five years. A lot of them are unwilling to give those unless you give an offer price. The financial statement gives you full picture of what is going on.
