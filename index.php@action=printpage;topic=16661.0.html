				Grateful if anyone could offer comment on convenience and value of zipcar compared to other car rental options (La Guardia car rentals, etc).<br /><br />I&#039;m a weekday commuter and only want a car occasionally on Sat-Sun for large scale shopping, day trips, and for road trip vacations.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve used zipcar, is there always the type of car you want when you need it? Are they more convenient for occasional use than going to LaGuardia to hire?<br />Thank you.

The cars are always available. I notice if you look on fridays that there is not much available for the weekend.&nbsp; If you book days in advance they would be available.<br /><br />Different locations have different cars and some locations take better care of the cars than others.<br /><br />In one location I think the guys sit in the cars all day.&nbsp; They are always dirty inside. A car I rented the other day smelled of smoke and fresh beer.

				I recently signed up for Zipcar for similar reasons.<br /><br />It&#039;s much more convenient but generally more expensive than renting from the airport. They are kept at the garage over the Rite Aid on 82nd and 37th. You walk in, tell them what car you reserved, and are out in less than 5 minutes. Gas and insurance are included. There is also the flexibility of renting for only an hour or two. On the negative side, you always have to return it to the same location, and if you&#039;re going for a long time (e.g. overnight) the hourly rate adds up to a significantly worse deal than you can usually get from regular rental places. I probably wouldn&#039;t use it for a road trip for those reasons.

				Yeah, I used 5 times so far in the past 2 yr since I signed up, my company have 50% off membership deal with them, which is only reason I sign up.<br /><br />They are good for running few hours errand, but anything over a day you better off doing car rental. I only use the one on the 80th street is inside a coop garage, kind of confusing for first time. All the car I used so far are pretty dirty, sticky cup holder, some have smoke smell, dirty dashboard, some seat have crumble on it.<br /><br />Is cheaper than Uber if you need to drive somewhere that is 30+ minutes and you return within 3 or 4 hours.
