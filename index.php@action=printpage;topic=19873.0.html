				Two stores that I have seen requiring gloves and masks are the Desi markets - Patel&#039;s and Apna. I have heard that there are others. Some even say that bandannas and scarves are not allowed. So what&#039;s next? Wrong type of mask or glove?

				What good are the gloves when you have to touch shared door knobs and handles to make your way to the store in the first place? Wouldn&#039;t those same potential virus be on your gloves instead?<br /><br />I could understand for protecting yourself, you can go straight to the garbage and dump them when you get inside and then wash your hands, but I&#039;m not sure what they are doing for others in the pharmacy shelves when they are touching the same surfaces and objects your hands would touch.

Here&#039;s an explanation- link below. I wish store owners would understand this, but since they don&#039;t, here&#039;s a suggestion: just get a pair of cheap sports gloves like these <br />(https://i.imgur.com/QTaUmvO.jpg) <br />for shopping trips where gloves are required. I bought a pair for $1.49 in a dollar store just as things were ramping up in March, but now with most dollar stores closed I&#039;m not sure where you can get them.<br /><br />https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/should-you-wear-gloves-to-the-grocery-store<br /><br />

Your skin is an organ (remember that little fact from middle school biology?) that protects you from viruses and bacteria. Gloves aren&#039;t magic. You still have to refrain from touching your face when you have them on, wash your hands after you put your purchases away, sanitize your phone, doorknob, etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the last store I shopped in was Key Food up on 86th and Northern. They didn&#039;t require that I put on a pair of gloves to enter. The guy at the door though wouldn&#039;t get the hell out of the way so I could pass by him with at least six feet of space. He took one step aside so I would have had at best two feet between him and me. I asked him repeatedly to give me space. He seemed to understand me, but didn&#039;t seem to understand 2 feet is not 6 feet. It was only after I started to get very upset that he moved.<br /><br />That and the price gouging and I&#039;m not going back. Hell if I know where to shop though anymore. C-Town wasn&#039;t offering senior hours, and I&#039;m still haunted by the extreme overcrowding at the Foodtown in mid-March.

				While viruses are not shed from skin, they can be spread by mucus on your hands from rubbing your runny nose. Whether skin is a better conveyor than nitrile is another matter. I wear the gloves primarily to remind myself not to touch my face and I discard them after each use. The fact is that they still don&#039;t fully understand how this virus is transmitted, and I don&#039;t begrudge anyone&#039;s attempt to safeguard their employees. If wearing gloves offends you, shop elsewhere. With Queens hospitalization and mortality rates I wonder why any stores stay open. If they want me to wear a hazmat suit, I&#039;ll try to find one. Should cut down the lines anyway.

The gloves are touching the same surfaces your hands would be touching. The door handles, products on the shelves, other shared surfaces, etc. The virus are just on the gloves instead of your hands. It&#039;s not helping the spread at all unless there&#039;s some evidence that the virus doesn&#039;t last as long on glove material than bare skin. I haven&#039;t seen that study if so.<br /><br />What someone mentioned about having them on making it easier to remind you not to touch your face (like tying a string around your finger) sounds like about all you can get from them in my estimation.

If you&#039;re wearing it right, you can&#039;t touch your mouth and nose. People who wear glasses - who is bothering with contacts nowadays outside of essential workers? - end up touching the mask to make adjustments, which isn&#039;t ideal.<br /><br />I don&#039;t begrudge anyone who wants to wear gloves though, as long as they dispose of them properly and understand a glove doesn&#039;t provide magical protection to themselves or others from germs.

				Also Key Food on 90th Street, between Roosevelt and 37th Ave, require gloves.&nbsp; I was turned away yesterday, but people with nasty dirty gloves were allowed in.&nbsp; Today I noticed the worker at the door was giving produce bags to those without gloves and still allowing entry to those with obviously dirty gloves.&nbsp; Management has no idea what they are doing.

				<br />There are two stores on 37th between 78th and 79th that require gloves. They are general stores that carry miscellaneous household<br />things and are more or less next to each other although separated by a laundromat. I don&#039;t know how strict they are but there are clear signs about gloves on their front doors.

				I&#039;ve been wearing them but notice that the stores just seem to be asking for masks, and there seems to be informed opinion against gloves. (Yes, I do the careful handwashing etc.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				My impression is that most authoritative advice does NOT recommend gloves. They give a false sense of security--you can pick up virus on the gloves just as easily as on your hands--the virus does not seep in through your skin, so what are the gloves doing for you anyway, most people don&#039;t know the established technique of putting gloves on and off so as to not contaminate the gloves or your hands, etc, etc. In cases where hand-washing is not possible and you will be touching something like a gas pump that many other hands are touching, I can see putting on disposable gloves for that and then throwing them away and using hand sanitizer--but otherwise, I don&#039;t see what gloves are doing that is helpful. You can spread any virus you might pick up on your hands just as easily if you have gloves on as if you don&#039;t.
