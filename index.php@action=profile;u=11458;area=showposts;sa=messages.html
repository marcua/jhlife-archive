Even in a city like New York, where restaurants and takeout are a way of life, most buyers still expect kitchens with a dishwasher. â€œPeople are very busy, and a dishwasher is not considered a luxury item,â€ said Victoria Rong Kennedy, a senior vice president at Citi Habitats in New York. â€œItâ€™s now considered an absolute essential for most households.â€<br /><br />Therefore, she said, if you want your apartment to sell quickly, itâ€™s a good idea to have one. â€œIt doesnâ€™t have to be the most fancy, upscale one,â€ she added. â€œBut it does have to be there.â€ Without a dishwasher, she said, your apartment would likely be considered â€œbelow average.â€</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />read more:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/garden/do-dishwashers-help-sell-apartments.html?ref=realestate" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/garden/do-dishwashers-help-sell-apartments.html?ref=realestate</a><br /><br />As I said in the original post, it surprised me to see so many &quot;recently upgraded&quot; or completely new kitchens in Jackson Heights, that did not have a dishwasher (even if there was space to put one).<br /><br />As a potential buyer, I assume that if I don&#039;t see a dishwasher, that means the board has rules against it, and I won&#039;t be able to install one if I move in. So I rule those coops out.

					Many online reports that Retro Fitness makes it difficult to cancel a membership (see links listed in one of the posts here):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/retro-fitness-brooklyn" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.yelp.com/biz/retro-fitness-brooklyn</a><br /><br />Basically, they continue to charge you while they drag their feet to cancel your membership. This seems to be standard with these big chains like Golds and World Gym which want your credit card info upfront for automatic payments. Also, if the gym stops being profitable they can let services slide, or even shut down. I&#039;m guessing that they are franchises, and just like there can be a &quot;bad&quot; Subway Sandwiches shop, the franchise logo doesn&#039;t guarantee satisfaction. Just be careful, that&#039;s all I&#039;m saying. <br /><br />I also noticed that the Retro Fitness is most definitely in Astoria. Much closer to Steinway St. than Roosevelt Ave. <br /><br />The search continues.

					I would prefer to pay upfront for 6 months (or a year) rather than hand my credit card over, and authorize monthly payments. These automatic payments can be hard to stop (lots of horror stories about big franchises taking additional months to cancel a membership, or charging a cancellation fee, etc). If I join a gym, I&#039;m going to exercise, period. I am certain that a year from now, I&#039;ll still want a gym. So paying upfront is only a risk if the gym sucks, or goes out of business. I can usually tell if the gym is no good (and I can tolerate a crummy place, if there are no other choices). Health clubs are a big source of consumer fraud (pre-sales but then the gym never opens, etc) so there are laws that are somewhat protective. If the facility is big, it&#039;s unlikely they will go out of business, but these gyms seem to be the type that are hard to cancel (look at reviews on Yelp or Google for horror stories). So, I prefer paying upfront.<br /><br />Since you guys are talking about going outside of Jackson Heights, I liked the gym called Phyzique in Woodside (I only visited). Not huge but medium-large, clean, good selection of machines and free weights, near the 7 train 52nd street station (located on 50th street just above Roosevelt). I don&#039;t recall if they have a separate room for aerobics (I mainly use the free weights)&nbsp; -- sorry about that, aerobics folks. Maybe call to ask. Worth a visit in-person. They have treadmills, bikes and steppers if I recall. Nice facility. I was there in the afternoon (it was quiet) but like every gym, I suppose it gets busy between 6 and 9pm.<br /><a href="http://phyzique4life.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://phyzique4life.com/</a><br /><br />I also liked Big 6 Gym in Woodside (on Queens Blvd) which is large, very well-equipped, and they do have aerobics classes. Again, I only visited during the daytime. You can expect an after-work rush. Formerly a Golds Gym or maybe World Gym (?). It&#039;s in the Big 6 mall.<br /><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-six-fitness-woodside" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-six-fitness-woodside</a><br /><br />(I didn&#039;t want to promote these gyms too much, because they are not within the confines of JH. But since I see other people mentioning Sunnyside and Astoria, I thought I would mention them again.)<br /><br />I want to move to the area, and a good gym within walking distance is non-negotiable, so I&#039;ve been visiting different facilities to see what they offer. It&#039;s a definite drawback that JH doesn&#039;t have more. I&#039;ll check out Retro Fitness at some point soon!

					I&#039;m looking for an apartment to buy, and I&#039;m surprised that so few places come equipped with a dishwasher. Even many many recently renovated apartments, and apartments that cost in the $200,000 range don&#039;t have dishwashers. What&#039;s even more surprising is when the listings boast that the kitchen is all-new, or recently upgraded, or all-new stainless steel appliances (etc)... and they <em>still</em> don&#039;t have a dishwasher. A new dishwasher is only (guessing) 500 dollars, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the apartment price. And it makes the apartment far more desireable, so sellers can probably charge more for those units.<br /><br />So, what&#039;s up with that? In an efficiency kitchen, obviously it&#039;s a matter of space. But a lot of these units are eat-in kitchen, or have enough space - if the space was used more efficiently. Does it have anything to do with the plumbing, or are there other structural reasons?<br /><br />If it&#039;s for &#039;green&#039; reasons, the EPA says that dishwashers are more energy efficient, and more water efficient, than hand-washing dishes. A load with 12 place settings (admittedly, a full load is optimum to display a dishwasher&#039;s efficiency) uses 4 gallons of water, while hand washing 12 place settings requires 27 gallons of water. It also requires more power (to heat that hot water). Even with a smaller load hand washing is less efficient. So it costs shareholders more money (on the water bill, and to heat up the furnace) not to have dishwashers installed. Maybe people don&#039;t realize that? Or is there a structural reason?<br /><br />I guess theoretically, a person could install a dishwasher in the apartment after buying the unit, but it seems unlikely that would be allowed, if there isn&#039;t a dishwasher already installed. If I don&#039;t see a dishwasher in a modern kitchen, I&#039;m assuming the building doesn&#039;t allow it.

					It looks like all the &quot;fitness&quot; pictures on the Urban Jungle website are taken outdoors, as if they conduct their classes in a park. (The martial arts classes photos were taken indoors). Do they have weightlifting equipment there?<br /><br />If you are willing to go as far as Queens Blvd, there is a Bally&#039;s on Queens Blvd. and approx. 75th (reviews don&#039;t seem positive) and also Big Six Fitness on Queens Blvd. and approx. 61st (which is a great gym, IMO -- I checked it out a few months ago -- but I think it&#039;s too far for most people to walk from Jackson Heights).<br /><br />It seems like Jackson Heights remains ripe for picking, for a nice gym that caters to people who want weights and cardio machines. It doesn&#039;t have to be a huge complex with a pool and spa facilities, IMO. For one thing, those memberships are two or three times more expensive. The start-up costs on that would be enormous, and the amount of land required would add to the difficulty. IMO, a less-fancy gym would be fine, and actually preferable.

Trader Joe&#039;s has spent billions of dollars promoting itself as a good employeer, but just like Fox News&#039; attempt at a similar PR, most of us have the ability to see through the campaign. <br /><br />Reason TJ has low prices? same as why Wal-Mart has low prices. They pressure the supliers to agree to artificialy low prices. <br /><br />I for one, will not stand by while people beg a multi-trillion dollar company to do business in my neighborhood. <br /><br />And remember K2000, if the &quot;big boys&quot;, Trader Joe&#039;s, Wal-Mart, Wholefoods, et.al. can get away with being terrible employeers, neighbors, and citizens, then the little guys will as well.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can we see some confirmation of your accusations that Trader Joes underpays their employees? Here&#039;s a website that says crew members make good money for a retail/grocery job, they get regular job reviews and raises, that they are generally treated well by management, they have access to health care benefits, etc:<br /><a href="http://www.jobitorial.com/trader-joes-job-reviews-C814" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jobitorial.com/trader-joes-job-reviews-C814</a><br /><br />That is just one link of many I found, Googling &quot;how much does Trader Joes pay&quot;.<br /><br />In contrast to the &quot;big boys&quot; I believe most Key Foods and Associated markets are privately owned, and they pay much less than what Trader Joes pays...<br /><br />So how about backing up some of your claims.&nbsp; &quot;multi-Trillion dollar company&quot; who &quot;spent billions of dollars promoting itself as a good employer&quot;. Really? <br /><br />The Fox News and Walmart comparisons seem like cheap shots. Sour grapes, perhaps?

I&#039;m more interested in the machines and weights, so I didn&#039;t really investigate the aerobics part of the gym. You might want to stop in there and take a look. (I like to see what other gyms offer, even if I don&#039;t sign up. Just curious, I guess). For free weights, Executive Fitness is not great, but if you are close by you can probably make it work. Like you said, convenience is everything... if you have to take the subway just to work out... ugh. If Executive Fitness is nearby, you might want to stop in there, and see for yourself.

NO WAY! They exploit the environment, exploit suppliers, exploit communities, and exploit workers! Trader Joe&#039;s is no better than wal mart in all of their practices, in fact they use the same playbook. If you really want a food distributor try, as Jeff said Fairway or a ShopRite. Say No to Trader Joe&#039;s. <a href="http://www.traitorjoe.com/index.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.traitorjoe.com/index.htm</a> or <a href="http://www.traitorjoesny.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.traitorjoesny.com/</a> <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s a little over the top.<br /><br />First of all, your Greenpeace link about sustainable seafood (<a href="http://www.traitorjoe.com/index.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.traitorjoe.com/index.htm</a>) says that Trader Joes has responded to activists and will only sell sustainable seafood starting in Dec. 2012. You should read your own links more closely -- that one is full of &quot;victory!&quot; messages.<br /><br />As far as the other link (<a href="http://www.traitorjoesny.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.traitorjoesny.com/</a>) -- apparently Trader Joes&#039; isn&#039;t a union shop? Too bad (I do support unions, and have been a union member in the past). However, there are much worse grocery chains the UFCW could be pressuring -- for example, Key Foods and Associated supermarkets, where in some cases, like the Bushwick Associated, employees make less than the minimum wage (there&#039;s a lawsuit there). In other locations, they merely make minimum wage. I&#039;m not an expert on the topic but from what I understand, employees at Trader Joes are compensated relatively well, and have good benefits (including health insurance options, if I&#039;m not mistaken).<br /><br />I like Trader Joes and I will continue to shop there - they have great prices on staples like yogurt, half &amp; half, nuts, olive oil, lean ground beef, frozen vegetables, egg whites, and other categories. The quality is better than my local Associated, and so are the prices.<br /><br />However, I do respect the concept of keeping &#039;big box&#039; stores from opening in the neighborhood.

					Where is &quot;I Love Kickboxing&quot;? I have been using Google Maps to look for gyms in Jackson Heights, and that one didn&#039;t come up yet.<br /><br />The NSI website makes it look like it is aimed towards women (mostly aerobics classes). Please correct me if I am wrong. A full report would be great.<br /><br />It seems like a recent trend in fitness is gyms where it&#039;s based around personal training... every session is done with a trainer coaching you. I guess that&#039;s nice but it would be prohibitively expensive for me. Just a quick look at the website makes me wonder if they only offer classes and personal training.

I was there a month ago, so some of the details are sketchy now. It&#039;s a storefront-sized space, I&#039;d estimate that it&#039;s 1500 to 2000 square feet (just a guess). The first 1/3rd is cardio, with bikes and treadmills. The middle 1/3rd of the room seems to be exercise machines (not Nautilus or Universal, but along those lines). Pulleys and plates and cams. The machines looked nice enough. The back 1/3rd of the gym is free weights, with dumbells (up to 100 pounds) a flat bench press, an incline bench press, a power lifting cage (nice feature to have), maybe a squat rack. I didn&#039;t see the dressing area but it didn&#039;t look large. The fellow (owner? Asian guy with muscles) seemed very nice, and no-nonsense. I can&#039;t remember the prices, but I&#039;ll guess that it was something like 199 or 249 for a whole year (cheap). I went during a busy time (8 pm?) and the gym was somewhat crowded, like every gym at that time, but definitely not unreasonable at all. I believe they are open until 11 pm or midnight during the week. <br /><br />All in all, does not look fantastic, but if you live near 72nd and Northern Blvd. and don&#039;t want to drive to a gym or take the subway, then it&#039;s a good option. Going here makes a lot more sense than walking to Executive Fitness on Roosevelt Ave. It&#039;s smaller than Executive Fitness (EF has a whole separate aerobics room) but looks less crowded during peak hours, and not as beat-up and rusty like Executive Fitness. <br /><br />Executive Fitness WAS a 24 hour gym Mon-Thurs (if the above poster is correct they changed their hours) which was a nice feature... if they changed it, too bad.

					What are some general guidelines for what Boards want to see, in order to get approved? I&#039;ve heard that 28% debt-to-income ratio is somewhat typical. A broker told me that Boards also generally want to see two years of reserve (maintenance and mortgage) in the buyer&#039;s bank account, as well. Is that typical? I understand that some buildings will be more lenient, and others less lenient. <br /><br />I am a cash buyer, but two years additional reserve is not possible for me, even without the mortgage aspect (for the units I&#039;m interested in). I was also told that in the case of a Sponsor sale, then this two year reserve is not applicable. Is this correct?<br /><br />If I will need a two year cash reserve, then I need to lower my standards -- I&#039;ve been looking at units that are priced at the top threshold of my ability to pay in cash. I may need to look at less expensive units, with the understanding that some of my cash will need to be held in reserve, to get Board approval.<br /><br />

					The lack of a decent gym in Jackson Heights is the biggest sticking point I have with the neighborhood (I&#039;m thinking about moving there). If the gym is more than a 15 minute walk (let alone a subway ride...! or a place you have to drive to...!) odds are pretty high you&#039;re going to skip a lot of workouts when it&#039;s raining, or snow is on the ground. JH is absolutely under-served in that department. If you look up gyms/do a search on Google maps, you can see a vast area of Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst that has no options at all. A gym on Northern Blvd would probably clean up (would need research to confirm demographics, but there is only Curves on Northern Blvd, and a small gym/karate studio near the BQE.<br /><br />In my opinion, a NY Sports Club with a pool, etc, isn&#039;t necessary (huge investment up front). A bare-bones gym with plenty of space and new equipment would do well, be less expensive to open (and less expensive to join). Northern Blvd. seems like an obvious place where that could happen. The Executive Fitness gym is far enough away that they could co-exist. People want a gym that they can easily walk to, and the area around Northern Blvd is ripe for picking.<br /><br />There are great gyms in Woodside, Astoria, and Flushing. Rego Park and Forest Hills have chains like Ballys. I don&#039;t see why Jackson Heights is so lacking in this regard.
