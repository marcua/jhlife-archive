				Elevators at 82nd Street Subway - Change.org petition (https://www.change.org/p/andrew-m-cuomo-elevators-at-82nd-street-subway)<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Post</strong>:<br /><br />Petition Calls for an Elevator to be Included in 82nd Street Subway Station Upgrade (https://jacksonheightspost.com/petition-calls-for-an-elevator-to-be-included-in-82nd-street-subway-station-upgrade)<br /><br /><em>Nov. 20, 2019 By Allie Griffin<br /><br />A Jackson Heights resident has started a petition calling on the MTA to add an elevator when it overhauls the 82nd Street subway station.<br /><br />The Change.org petition, posted by Jackson Heights Beautification Group president Nuala O’Doherty on Tuesday, has already garnered more than 300 signatures at the time of publication.<br /><br />The MTA plans to overhaul the decrepit station along with at least five others along the 7 line. The agency told the Queens Post last week that the project is currently in the design phase and it will award a contract for the work by summer 2020 with construction possibly beginning soon after.<br /><br />The petition noted that the MTA will likely spend millions to revamp the 82nd Street station and included in that cost should be the installation of an elevator.<br /><br />“The MTA will spend millions of dollars revamping the 82nd Street 7 line subway station,” it states. “The renovation must include the addition of an elevator.”<br /></em><br /><br />[<strong>Follow above link for full article.</strong>]

				I&#039;m all for it!<br /><br />I also suggested to the bus network feedback that a bus following the 7 line between 74th and main street would be very helpful in terms of accessibility, and another following the N . Don&#039;t suppose it will happen!<br />&nbsp;

				The new stations on the N/W in Astoria look great. <br /><br />Hope we get stations like those. <br /><br />However, my friends in Astoria did complain somewhat while the stations were closed for long stretches during the renovations.<br /><br />So, be prepared...

				For some reason the 90th Street station, my station, is the only one not being upgraded.

				they are very nice upgrades, but i question the feasibility of doing complete shutdowns on the 7, since that would create far bigger service gaps than on the N/W.&nbsp; close the Broadway station, and it&#039;s a couple of blocks to the 36th avenue station (or the 30th avenue one). i lived in astoria from 1989-1996, and walked those blocks often, and it seems like those were shorter jaunts than between 7 stations (i may be wrong, of course). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19528.msg96693.html#msg96693">Quote from: abcdefghijk on November 21, 2019, 07:57:14 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The new stations on the N/W in Astoria look great. <br /><br />Hope we get stations like those. <br /><br />However, my friends in Astoria did complain somewhat while the stations were closed for long stretches during the renovations.<br /><br />So, be prepared...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
