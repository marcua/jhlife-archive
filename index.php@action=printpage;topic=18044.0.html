				The family behind Seba Seba will be opening a new cafe on 82nd Street and Northern Blvd, scheduled to open in September.&nbsp; According to the article, the new place will be located at the space formerly occupied by Conway&#039;s Funeral Home.<br /><br />Cafe/Bakery to Open on Northern Boulevard by Owners of Seba Seba (https://jacksonheightspost.com/cafe-bakery-to-open-on-northern-boulevard-by-owners-of-seba-seba)<br /><br /><em>David Velasquez, whose father and uncle established Seba Seba, said Parva will be separate.<br /><br />He said that Parva will offer Colombian baked good similar to Seba Seba but will also sell traditional European items such as scones, croissants and bagels.<br /><br />However, items such as scones and croissants will incorporate South American flavors. He said they include popular fruits such as passion-fruit, guava and soursop.<br /><br />“We want to stand out. Anyone can offer a croissant, but not everyone can add our ingredients and make them the way we do,” Velasquez said.<br /><br /></em>

				New cafe coming to the corner of 82nd and Northern. They’ve been building it out for a while, but only just put the signage up. Wasn’t sure what to expect since the construction wall blocked any views inside, but I always figured it would be a bit of a nicer spot based on the architecture. Though, I’ll be honest, not sure if I needed another bakery in my life. Haha.

				Went to Parva this morning. This is a great bakery that I would consider unique for the area. The large windows make it nice and bright inside, it&#039;s right at a bus stop on Northern Blvd, and it&#039;s attached to the adjacent laundromat. I think the variety was decent for just opening this week. I had a pumpkin scone, which was awesome, and a ham and cheese croissant. They also had bagels, other croissants and pastries, all made in-house. The coffee is also great. They sell their own whole beans from Columbia. The man working behind the counter was very friendly. This is truly a great addition to the neighborhood.

				Just tried it out today. Really nice addition to the neighborhood. It&#039;s chic, airy, I honestly could see myself (dare I say it) sitting here with a laptop. Perfect example of how nice finishes create great ambience. Biz owners, take note!!!<br /><br />

				This place is charming. Limited bakery goods but all excellent---and the coffee was delicious. Had a pastry made from croissant dough with a bit of guava--great. My friend had a very nice apple turnover. Nice addition to the neighborhood!

				&nbsp;We had some tasty things too. The scones were delicious, moist and flavorful. The atmosphere in the bakery is warm and welcoming. The concept that it is connected to the super laundry (ecological water saving, time saving- one hour or less!) next door is at first strange to see but once we had those wonderful scones I was thinking about how to do a two in one next time with my laundry.

				Had a berry scone yesterday that was absolutely delicious.&nbsp; Also tried a plain croissant that was on par with Cannelle, flaky and buttery.&nbsp; (I am not a fan of Farine&#039;s croissant, which is too sweet.)&nbsp; As other posters have said, the coffee is excellent.<br /><br />

				I really like this place, it&#039;s a great addition to JH. The owner and employees are super nice and their coffee is really good as well, it&#039;s a pleasant place to hang out for a while.

				Another upvote for the coffee. It was so good I bought a container for home as well. They have a recycle program too. It costs $11 the first time, $9 if you bring your container back to get it refilled.

				Like Parva VERY much. Enjoyed their house brand Hot Cocoa (no sugar-- you add to taste), Cappuccino, and Passionfruit Danish. <br /><br />Curiously, I see a kitchen, but not a menu. Maybe I&#039;ve gone too late in the evening.

				Finally got to try this place today.&nbsp; <br />Hands down, the best cup of coffee I have had at any place in the Heights. Not even close. <br />(side note: how&nbsp; supposed &#039;French&#039; style bakeries can serve crappy American coffee always perplexes me)<br />Back to Parva.. The pastry selection isn&#039;t huge, but what I had rocked.&nbsp; <br />The place has a great style too.<br />Only negative is the seating is pretty limited, so I could see a situation where I go and there&#039;s no spot to sit.<br />But based on today&#039;s experience, I&#039;ll risk it. <br />Only hope they open as many of these around the neighborhood as they did Seba Seba.<br />The Velasquez brothers really should be congratulated (and supported) on this one!<br /><br /><br />
