				Yeah, too bad Armondo&#039;s could not come back, but they had bad blood with the landlord. They seem to be doing fine in their new location. I just hope Romeo&#039;s does not turn out to be just another pizza joint with a few other Italian offerings. I think we have enough pizza places already--what we need is a real restaurant. There seem to be a zillion places called Romeo&#039;s Pizza and Italian Restaurant I found via Google, all over the place, but I couldn&#039;t find a sign that there was a chain by that name, which is what I was thinking it might be. Even if it&#039;s a chain, if it&#039;s a good one, it will be a nice addition.

				I doubt it&#039;s a pizza place, the sign doesn&#039;t say pizza, and with the $$$ rent, I don&#039;t they could survive on just pizza. I would imagine they will eventually have a liquor license, to help pay the pricey rent.

				Went to opening night at Romeo&#039;s, and judging by the food I ate tonight I have to say we have a first class Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. To begin with, we were given some excellent crusty bread along with a small plate of zuccini that had been fried with oil and garlic and chili flakes. A waiter also came to our table with large chunks of what I believe was parmigiano reggiano. My wife and I shared an order of fried calamari and I got veal scallopini saltimbocca&nbsp; on a bed of spinach and my wife got the salmon. Everything was really excellent. The calamari was lightly battered and perfectly cooked. The sauce on my veal was really well balanced and the salmon was also excellent. The best part was that on opening night they took 50% off the cost of everything, so for three drinks and the above mentioned food, the check came to thirty-five dollars and change. I grew up in Bensonhurst when it was predominantly Italian and I&#039;ve spent several months in Sicily, so I know a bit about Italian food and this restaurant really struck a chord in me.

				Was excited to pass by tonight on my way home around 9:30 and saw that it was open and packed! I can&#039;t wait to try it. When Armondo&#039;s was in that spot, we used to go fairly often--it was so close to our apartment, and it was quite good for the basics.&nbsp; Very happy to have a real Italian restaurant in that spot again, as walking all the way to the new Armondo&#039;s is just not the same--plus I don&#039;t like their new menu as much as I liked the old one. I bet Romeo&#039;s will do very well--it really meets a need in the neighborhood.

				This place is actually fancier and more traditional than I would have imagined.<br /><br />And seems closer to the old Armondo&#039;s that used to be there.<br /><br />Not really my own aesthetic...but pretty nice for what they&#039;re going for.

				Ate here last Saturday and have to say I really enjoyed it.&nbsp; I thought the food, service, and atmosphere were very fine.&nbsp; The place was packed. The service, however,&nbsp; was not at all affected by this. The service remained&nbsp; attentive and not intrusive (Pretty impressive for a place that only opened a week or two before.). I tried the octopus served with frisee salad and finished with the veal scallopini. Both were well prepared and yummy!.&nbsp; Most importantly …….Soooooo nice not to be surrounded by TV screens and blaring music. Wish them luck.&nbsp; (I didn&#039;t check out the wine list...but will do so next time!)

				Was pretty disappointed by our experience last night. The restaurant is lovely inside and I think could improve but a couple of things happened to make our meal less than ideal: it took an incredibly long time for us to even get menus. Once we ordered it took almost an hour and a half between the time we sat down to the time we received our food - two tables that came in after us were served before us. When the food arrived they brought out the wrong order for me and I had to wait without food while my dinner company ate their dishes. When my partner was ordering food he specifically asked if anything came with the chicken dish he was interested in, and was told pasta and told to choose a type. When his meal arrived, they didn&#039;t bring out the pasta, when we inquired about the pasta we were told the dish doesn&#039;t come with it. We mentioned that we had specifically asked and the waiter walked away and said &quot;I&#039;ll check&quot; and never came back or updated us on the status of the side. <br /><br />I understand that this is a new restaurant and they are working through getting everything to run smoothly, but they could have handled the situation better.

				I had a similar experience.&nbsp; I ordered the chicken parm and asked if I could substitute a vegetable for the pasta. They told me that the entree doesn&#039;t come with anything.&nbsp; Just the chicken on a plate.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I have ever ordered chicken parm at an Italian restaurant where it didn&#039;t come with some type of side.<br /><br />Still, I like the place and hope they do well.

				I agree with Lilybell.&nbsp; &nbsp;With no side dish especially pasta which goes with chicken parmigiana + negative reviews on Jackson Heights Life + negative reviews on Yelp = great news for Armondo&#039;s and Uncle Peter&#039;s.&nbsp; At both these restaurants entrees include a side dish.&nbsp;

				Well that&#039;s really disappointing. I think they are constantly tinkering with everything--I went early on and then again later and I think the menu changed in the meantime. I don&#039;t believe we experienced the no side dishes with the entree issue-- that could be new. Maybe they weren&#039;t making enough money and decided to make everything a la carte. That&#039;s really too bad if that&#039;s the case, because it definitely would put a damper on my desire to patronize the place. I hope they are listening to feedback. So far they seem to be doing good business, from what I can tell passing by frequently.

				No side is wierd, but what got me is that we explicitly asked about a side before choosing the dish, was told it came with pasta and to choose the type of pasta we wanted and then when the dish arrived without the pasta, and we asked where it was, was told it didn&#039;t come with a side. It felt a little bit like a bait and switch.

				opalis141--did you ask to speak to a manager and did you complain? I certainly would have done so. When I was there (twice so far) the waiters were extremely attentive, and one of the owners came by to ask if everything was good. So I am surprised at the picture I am getting from recent posts here about inattentive waiters, food taking too long or getting the order wrong. And this situation you describe as bait and switch is unacceptable. They certainly should have been called on it. I think I would have noticed if I&#039;d been told that everything was a la carte the two times I ate there--I think if that&#039;s true, it must be a new policy and one that would definitely make me less interested in patronizing them.

				The waiter asked the manager when we inquired and he brushed him off, to be honest I didn&#039;t want to continue to make an issue of it. As to the secondi point, my partner ordered a chicken dish, not chicken parm which is why he asked when ordering :(

				that&#039;s a bummer, really. we&#039;ve been looking forward to trying the place, and still may, but this would leave a sour taste (no pun intended). not so much the a la carte pricing, but the seemingly brusque way the diners were handled.

				Yeah that&#039;s kind of a bummer, isn&#039;t it? Romeo&#039;s is extremely convenient for me, but paying that much for plain old chicken parmigiana plus one side--that&#039;s a lot. We order chicken parm from Mama Rosa&#039;s. Granted, it&#039;s not a white tablecloth experience, merely takeout, but I&#039;d wager the chicken parm is just as good. And yes, it comes with pasta (though that is not clear on Seamless--they should fix that issue). <br /><br />I gather the Romeo&#039;s owners and staff come from an upscale Manhattan restaurant, and maybe they think that they can operate the same way in JH. I guess we&#039;ll see. There are a couple of pretty upscale Italian restaurants in Corona that probably have similar prices and seem to do well--I&#039;ve been to each of those once, and don&#039;t recall whether everything was a la carte, but they were pricey. So maybe Romeo&#039;s can follow suit--but I bet they won&#039;t get as much business from people who make it a frequent stop and become regulars. It will be more of a special occasion place.

				Okay so we went again tonight. The waiter who took our order said that the dishes do come with a side--pasta or vegetable. I ordered a special, chicken marsala, and he said it would come with spinach. Then another waiter came by and said that we had been misinformed about the side dish coming with the main dish, but he would give me the spinach anyway! <br /><br />Hmm....don&#039;t know why they can&#039;t get their story straight. He did give me the spinach, and the food was good (we had linguine with clams as well) and overall we had a nice time--and the place was quite crowded with a wide variety of people, all ethnicities, by the way--reflective of the neighborhood and not just a certain segment of the population. <br /><br />So they seem to be doing well regardless of the confusion or the a la carte menu. They just seem to be kind of disorganized still. We saw waiters giving other diners the little wedge of parmesan they give as an appetizer, but they never brought it to our table. However, they did bring the zucchini appetizer (free) that we got one of the two prior times we dined there.&nbsp; My daughter asked for a candle in the dessert we ordered (it was my birthday) and several waiters came and sang Happy Birthday. It was nice, the service was quite friendly--though I will say that getting served was a bit on the slow side. All in all--I&#039;ll go back, though the thing about no sides with the main dish does annoy me.

				Rarely have I seen a place go downhill so quickly. I raved about it opening night, but I&#039;ve been there four more times since then and each visit was a bit worse than the previous one. Hope they turn things around, but I&#039;m not optimistic.

				I had the worst experience here, was served pasta so “al denté” , I almost broke my tooth on it. When I complained, I was told they serve their pasta al dente and to correct this, they just warmed the pasta some more. They did not remake it. This also happened to someone else and was told the same thing. Was hoping for a good local pasta/Italian restaurant. <br />I will continue going to Il Triangolo in Corona.

				It&#039;s too bad, but I see why they are not doing so well although the food is pretty good. In my mind, all the complaints people have made in this thread add up to this result in the end. It just isn&#039;t a place I would go to very often. We recently found a great new Italian place in the West 50s--Aroma Trattoria-- and I was thinking of Romeo&#039;s when we were there--how much more attentive and professional the service is at Aroma, how much nicer the atmosphere in a way that is hard to define. It&#039;s not stuffy and has a warmth that makes you want to become a regular. <br /><br />I am always struck by the contrast between the sparse crowd at Romeo&#039;s and the bustling business across the street at Farine&#039;s. What Farine&#039;s has done is amazing. It&#039;s not the same kind of &quot;fine dining&quot; experience--but have you ordered the meals there, not just the pastry? The food is excellent, very high-end. And the crowd is constant and very diverse--it&#039;s attracting a cross-section of the neighborhood. <br /><br />We order delivery from them sometimes--actually the food is delicious, but I&#039;d often rather have it at home where I can have wine with dinner, and not sit in their glass-wall, kind of cold setting. Last night, through some confusing mixup, they wound up bringing us double what we ordered--they forgot one item and instead of just bringing that, they brought an entire duplicate order. So we had six meals instead of three! Sometimes they are disorganized, but they&#039;re very nice, and anyway, I am amazed at the crowds in that place. It is possible to succeed as a restaurant here, evidently. Although you never know--so many places in the city that were always crowded have closed because even with steady business the financial pressures are great.
