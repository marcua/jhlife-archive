				Haven&#039;t been able to peek inside Stew&#039;s place since last month, hope all is going well and moving forward, walked past the Queensboro yesterday and the open kitchen area seems pretty well finished, bar area finished, new windows on 81st street side, entrance foyer framed out, wired and tiled. Addictive has passed all inspections and is awaiting their liquor license approval and hope to open the new space &quot;within a week or so&quot;....
