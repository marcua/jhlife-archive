				Hi all--cross-posting here. We just received notice that facade work is to begin on our building in the next few days and that it will last several months. I&#039;ve never lived in a building while this has gone on. I know some (perhaps, many) of you have experienced this a few times now and was hoping you could share some tips on how to prepare our apartment for the work. As an asthmatic, I&#039;m particularly concerned about the dust.<br />For example, I am wondering:<br />* how did you combat the dust? <br />* did you find HEPA air filters or using window insulator plastic helped? <br />* did you need to remove breakable items from the walls and shelves? just exterior walls or everything?<br />* did you do anything to protect your A/C units (short of removing them--they&#039;re sealed in at the moment)?<br />* was leaking an issue during the work?<br /><br />I&#039;d appreciate any tips or tricks you have! Thanks in advance!

				<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Some façade work can take several years to complete and every façade project is unique.&nbsp; I think that the rule of thumb is that if your apartment gets dusty easily, then unfortunately you will have to keep your windows closed and vacuum regularly with a HEPA equipped unit.&nbsp; You will hear a lot of people giving you different advise and opinions, but unless you keep your windows closed and routinely clean,&nbsp; those aerodynamic particles are unavoidable.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as keeping things off your shelves that may not be required.&nbsp; Simply monitor the vibration transfer into your apartment.&nbsp; You might find&nbsp; reason for concern most days,&nbsp; but then again...&nbsp; Hopefully you wont be too inconvenienced - Good Luck!</span>
