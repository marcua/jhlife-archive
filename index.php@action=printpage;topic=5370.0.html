				Just curious if anyone has any wild ones to share.<br /><br />Also, who here saves their costumes?&nbsp; My last year&#039;s Mount Rushmore actually is in my classroom right now, I save everything.&nbsp; Am I the only Halloween hoarder?&nbsp; :)

				I still have my awesome scarecrow costume, my giant feather black angel wings, and my flamenco dress from Spain (it&#039;s been in my family for 80 years and we&#039;ve all worn it for Halloween at some point. It&#039;s a real flamenco dress we got from the gypsies that lived in the caves near my family home in Andalusia).&nbsp; I love Halloween and my mom used to make great handmade costumes for us every year.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It must have been difficult to move around in a Mount Rushmore costume!
