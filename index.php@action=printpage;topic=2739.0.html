				I thought I&#039;d start this thread where we can all post ideas on how we can improve on our property&#039;s value or just make our homes more appealing and comfortable overall.&nbsp; For example, has anyone used color to create particular moods or do you just follow the latest trends?&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve noticed recently that in bathrooms, some people have been opting out of the traditional bathtub in favor of a shower stall.&nbsp; Would something like this affect a property&#039;s value or do you put those feelings aside because you&#039;ve always preferred a stall?&nbsp; Are you willing to sacrifice on appearance in favor of comfort?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been contemplating doing renovations on both kitchen and bath, and would appreciate any insight you guys may have.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s a good idea to get personal opinions on renovations and decorating.&nbsp; After all, we have to live with our decisions for quite a while, so I&#039;m trying to make the best choices beforehand.&nbsp; Thanks!

				Hi,<br /><br />I am more than happy to give you some feedback and/or comments from my prospective buyers.&nbsp; As it relates to shower and tub, they usually go crazy when they see that they can have both options.&nbsp; <br /><br />The initial feel of a unit when the prospective buyer walks in is extremely important.&nbsp; If it serene and inviting of course it is very appealing.&nbsp; If it is noisy and dark, less appealing.&nbsp; (The obvious.)&nbsp; They go nuts when the units are full of furniture, shades down, overflowing clothes and accessories.&nbsp; <br /><br />Buyers seem to be attracted to kitchens, but they are interested in kitchens that are bright, inviting, easy to use when cooking, and love some interesting detail and or conversation pieces in their kitchens.&nbsp; Either interesting nobs, some detail in the tiles, etc.&nbsp; In addition, some even like kitchens that they can themselves redo or add to if necessary.&nbsp; <br /><br />My prospective buyers indicate there is no need to spend a bundle in renovating the kitchen and bathroom, therefore, you take into consideration how you would feel if you were in search of a property and came into your unit.&nbsp; <br /><br />And a tip I received this morning was to start renovations from top to bottom, ceiling, side cabinets and walls, then floors, (floors depending on cabinetry of course) but floors are last.<br /><br />I&#039;m no expert, but meet prospective buyers daily and they offer much feedback when it comes to what they prefer.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				i moved into a junior 4 that required much work in the kitchen and bathroom, but i saw potential and the size was ideal. i just started renovating my kitchen with a very limited budget. included in the work is skimming the study (the junior 4th room) and the bedroom.<br /><br />the bedroom had a big radiator under an ugly radiator cover. it was leaking all winter long, so i turned it off and didn&#039;t need it at all. once the radiator was removed (and discarded), the exposed wall was peeling and disgusting so i had that skimmed and repainted.<br /><br />the study needed an overall skim job. i also sealed the entry between the study and the kitchen. i also decided to remove the ugly white doors between the study and the lounge and put in vintage french pocket doors, to save space. i heart pocket doors.<br /><br />the kitchen i&#039;ve decided to go with ikea cabinets, glass tile backsplash, caesarstone countertop and travertine floor tiles. i can&#039;t say how it looks yet because i am still in the midst of my renovations, but i am excited at the prospects. you wouldn&#039;t believe the bargains i&#039;ve negotiated for new appliances and tiles as well. it is a great time to haggle and buy.<br /><br />way before the start of my project, i had seen other apartments with kitchens already renovated and kept thinking i&#039;d do something different. and considering how much time i spend in the kitchen, having my specific needs met and my style expressed were important, therefore i preferred buying an apartment whose kitchen needed renovating, rather than settling for an already renovated kitchen that i did not decide on.<br /><br />renovating the bathroom will be saved for another season.

				When we bought our house last year it had four bathrooms, but none had a tub.&nbsp; (All stall showers)&nbsp; We initially passed over the house for that reason.&nbsp; Of course we have three small children so a tub is a necessity.&nbsp; When we finally made an offer, we factored the cost of renovation into the price.&nbsp; We did the renovation to our taste first and foremost, but tried to make it &quot;fit&quot; with the style of the house.&nbsp; (ie clawfoot tub.)&nbsp; We also spent a little extra on things that we thought would help in resale like a double-sink vanity with a marble top.&nbsp; &nbsp;Incidentally, the kitchen had been recently renovated.&nbsp; It was originally a galley kitchen, but they knocked down the wall to create a more open layout, which was a major selling point.&nbsp; We have painted some rooms to our taste, knowing that we will probably have to make them more neutral if/when we ever sell.

				Thanks for all the comments!<br /><br />It makes a lot of sense to me that removing a bathtub would negatively affect resale value.&nbsp; People with children and those that enjoy taken baths every now and then would probably not give a second look.&nbsp; What it boils down to is that if I were to remove the tub, it would mean that I&#039;m in it for the long haul...not going anywhere any time soon.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=2739.msg18316.html#msg18316">Quote from: cl4t on May 13, 2009, 11:04:27 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the kitchen i&#039;ve decided to go with ikea cabinets, glass tile backsplash...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve given much thought to a glass tile backsplash, but everyone I know that has had this done usually complains that the tiles are not in line with each other.&nbsp; Shoddy work is probably to blame in most cases, so it&#039;s important to find a good tiler.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;d love to know how your kitchen turns out.&nbsp; Please post an update when complete!&nbsp; I love the look of a glass tile backsplash.<br /><br /><br />
