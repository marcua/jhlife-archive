				Augie; You have related to these people like you had known them very well and in some cases put some of them down and sat across from the post office that doesn&#039;t mean that you knew them closely like I had. In most cases, as well as the Splendon Social Club you couldn&#039;t be more incorrect. As far as the &quot;Note&quot; that was before the club. All what you call &quot;Troublemakers:came from the neighborhood. Because of happy hour all tom, Dick &amp; Harry&#039;s came from outside the neighborhood for I/2 price drinks and in some cases cause trouble. Do you think the Management would have put up with us as long as they did if we didn&#039;t protect their bar. May&#039;be you were correct in some cases, but that was before the Club and in many cases things were started by other groups. Later when the splendon Club was opened we were just trying to be alone protecting our own with some outside invited friends. Augie (As you related your name) ain&#039;t going to do it. Unless it it a fictitious name I never heard of you. If you have known these people and have something to say send me a personal message or go on with your fictitious rambling that you remember (Or you heard). Were you there?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I agree with splendonsc. You know all the names, however you time lines are way off. And you have people hanging together who never actually hung together in the places you mention. You obviously know zero about the club because all you say about it is incorrect.&nbsp; Fights in the Golden Note were generally caused by outsiders as when it was just our crowd,&nbsp; there were no fights. I don&#039;t know where you got your information but it does not appear to be first hand experience.&nbsp; To echo splendonsc<br />&quot;Were you there????&quot;
