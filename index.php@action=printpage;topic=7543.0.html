				I just happened across the new location of famed restaurant, Mamajuana Cafe, on Broadway in Woodside. &nbsp;Has anyone ever visited the Washington Heights location? &nbsp;BTW, Ricardo Cardona, the chef at Gabbana (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4529.msg29964#msg29964) is behind this restaurant as well.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to Mamajuana&#039;s website:<br /><br />Mamajuana Cafe (http://www.mamajuana-cafe.com/)

				Might be a nice addition, though it seems (from Yelp reviews) to be quite meat-heavy. How was the decor and ambiance?

				I went by yesterday for a few drinks. Place is okay, smell of fresh paint is still quite strong. Didn&#039;t try the food. I would seem to me this place will play double duty as a restaurant by day, dance lounge by night. Competing with Don Coqui, Jubilee, Gabanna, etc.

				i went in and got a menu. It&#039;s not a great location, just at the SE crux of bway and northern blvd. they would do much better in the uncle peters area and east of there. <br /><br />sooo.... most of the entrees are in the 20-30 dollar range. they also have tapas. the food probably is good, i&#039;d expect to spend a bit more than you&#039;re used to. also good for people who like drinks and stuff. I dont really drink so I don&#039;t know how to explain it exceptionally well.

				I went back again this past Thursday night (around 1030p) and it was completely dead. I don&#039;t think are officially open at all yet, maybe this is a pre-soft opening. You will certainly know they are open once the Latino radio station vans are out front and large groups of people are partying there at nights.<br />For now, Don Coqui is probably the hot spot to hang out at for music and drinks.

				FINALLY, Mamajuana&#039;s has shown a pulse! After catching Questlove of the Roots spin a DJ set at Studio Square we swung by Mamajuana Cafe in the hopes that we might stumble onto some food -- we were actually delighted to see that all of the windows/awnings were totally open to the outside and they had their parking lot cleared out of cars and placed tables and chairs and a DJ outside. <br /><br />Very festive, party atmosphere, not too crowded, maybe 50-80 people. Most were out for post-Colombian Independence Day celebrations so the crowd was quite attractive. At around 10p they also started serving hookah&#039;s. Admittedly, the music was on the loud side, and since the speakers and DJ set up were all outside, I don&#039;t think the neighbors will tolerate this on a regular basis. He was playing mostly salsa, bachata, a little cumbia and reggaeton.<br /><br />We tried the chicken empanadas which were good.<br /><br />Anyway, while it&#039;s fun and lasts, I finally recommend stopping by.

				Yeah, passed by it this past weekend. The location, which formerly housed the trashy (only judging by the megastrong neon lights) Excalibur, is somewhat crappy, though -- on a really dead and ugly stretch, next to used cars dealerships. They might even have some seating outside (can&#039;t remember), which might be made nice with plants etc. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been meaning to try this place, and will probably do so soon.&nbsp; As someone posted above, it appears as if the parking lot has been converted to outdoor seating.&nbsp; From outside looking in, the restaurant was quite crowded.... same as the outdoor seating area.&nbsp; It was a Saturday evening when I noticed this, so I&#039;m not sure how business is on weekdays.

				if this location is anything like the one in washington heights, it will be a fun hangout with really good drinks, a fun, lively vibe and food ... that will make you wait for a stop at KFC on the way home. if the chow is your raison d&#039;etre, look elsewhere. if it&#039;s the camaraderie and fun? a gold star destination.

				Does Novo do well? I think that might have been a better location. I&#039;m not really in that crowd, but I guess I&#039;m surprised that they are still in business.
