				Viva la Comida is returning for its 5th year to 82nd Street.&nbsp; It will be on Saturday, September 17 from 12-7.&nbsp; This year our goal is to bring together the communities that surround 82nd Street.&nbsp; Street food vendors and local restaurants will serve foods representing the Americas and Asia, i.e. Arepas, Churros, Momos,fuchkas, among other unique world foods.&nbsp; <br /><br />Art will have a prominent role this year.&nbsp; We will even have a Novel Prize for Literature nominee!&nbsp; Huang Xiang, a Chinese civil rights activist, renowned calligrapher, and poet, will conduct a calligraphic demonstration and poetry reading.&nbsp; And to commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, artist Mark Salinas (7TrainMurals) will lead the creation of a series of murals throughout the event. Centro Cultural Barco de Papel will host the painting of various household items in their “Cultural Identity Through Everyday Objects” art exhibit. The public can participate in the creation of these art projects. In addition, various local artists will exhibit their work at Dunnigham Triangle.<br />&nbsp;<br />At the stage, Music will range from latin “cortavenas” (love songs) to Brazilian Samba. LA Cumbiamba eNeye will be capturing the spirit of the outdoor parties that take place in Colombia, known as cumbiambas with their mix of rhythms that&nbsp; include cumbia, porro, gaita, puya, currulao, and abosao.&nbsp; While versatile Latin Jazz percussionist, Arturo Stable brings us Yuka Seca, a trio that features Pablo Moya on guitar and vocals, and Rudick Vidal on bass. Performing the most traditional songs and rhythms of the Cuban repertoire, this trio will also deliver all the excitement of the improvisation or descarga, and a sound that is both universal and irresistible to the body and feet. <br /><br />For more details check out our event page: www.vivalacomida.com

				Though it&#039;s a good event- the tragedy of re-doing Dunningham Triangle for over $500,000 while leaving it without any park benches is something to protest. <br />Seriously the answer from the BID and DROMM was that they didn&#039;t put benches in, because they didn&#039;t want homeless people there. <br />I consider it a missed opportunity to make the community more hospitable and engaging. Walking by a&nbsp; $500,000 park without benches represents all that is backwards, 1/2 assed and misappropriated in Queens. That a festival encourages people to attend park events and overlook the stupidity of that renovation is kind of shameful to our community members. <br /><br />Will the street be closed?

				The 82nd Street Partnership advocated and secured $200,000 from Borough President for the renovation of the Triangle.&nbsp; As a BID, our goal has always been to advocate for the community to have access to that underutilized space.&nbsp; We requested the inclusion of benches and a water fountain. Unfortunately, we didn&#039;t get either.&nbsp; The Partnership offered to add chairs and tables on a daily basis.&nbsp; But before we start doing this, the Parks Department needs to fix the large gaps between the blocks, which we consider an unsafe condition for a public space.&nbsp; You can support our efforts by contacting Parks and asking them to fix the problem.&nbsp; A 311 complaint will do.&nbsp; <br /><br />yes, as in prior years, the street will be close. <br /><br />Thanks for your feedback, and please don&#039;t hesitate to contact us if you have any other concerns.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				DOT, Parks Dept are so afraid of putting permanent seating. Fearful of &quot;homeless&quot; at the expense of locals. Check out Diversity Plaza. Why is there no permanent seating? BC people are afraid of &quot;homeless&quot; people. God forbid someone can rest somewhere. And complete non-understanding of communities that like to hang out past 8pm.&nbsp; I walk through Diversity Plaza around 11pm, and people are sitting on the curb and the dirty street. We really deserve better. <br /><br /><br />Complain! Not on JHL, but officially. The wheels that squeaks gets the grease.

				People on this board have complained about having benches in front of the post office - and other on-street locations - because the &quot;wrong&quot; people are using them. I&#039;m sure those same people would get their knickers in a twist if there were actual benches in that space as well.
