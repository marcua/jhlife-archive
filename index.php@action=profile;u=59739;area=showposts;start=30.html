					The market can correct some things, but it usually needs some goosing with public shame and bad publicity. Consumer Reports, the long-time non-profit based in Yonkers has a blog that takes companies to task. They have a staff that investigates, follows up, and usually gets, if not accountability, some answers. Their website is at <a href="http://www.consumerist.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.consumerist.com</a> . They have extensively followed and shamed the cable companies for ridiculous treatment of customers and have managed to get them to change some policies, particularly policies that affect subgroups of customers or localities. They have a tips link at <a href="mailto:tips@consumerist.com" class="bbc_email">tips@consumerist.com</a>. They have shown an interest in their blog in helping out folks in NYC and Philly as well as nationally.<br /><br />The New York Times also runs a consumer advocacy column that has investigated and followed up for individual consumers and class groups before as well. &quot;The Haggler&quot; is written by David Segal. The columns can be found at this link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/column/the-haggler" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/column/the-haggler</a>. You could also suggest a tip and complaint to them and see what they could do. Sometimes a call from a media source is what is needed to loosen the gears and make change happen. At the end of a recent column he gives the following as contact info: &quot;EMAIL: <a href="mailto:haggler@nytimes.com" class="bbc_email">haggler@nytimes.com</a> or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT. Keep it family-friendly and under 250 words, include your hometown and go easy on the caps-lock key. Letters may be edited for clarity and length.&quot; <br /><br />I have a friend who does social media and has managed to shame companies (particularly airlines) by tweeting them out publicly. That certainly usually gets a phone call from a rep at least. The more technically inclined can set up a system that tweets from a range of selected messages that provide a complaint/description/call to action at a regular time period. Make sure that it is directly sent to the main TWC account and hashtagged so that it comes up with regular TWC tweets. Just be sure to take the call when they want to make it stop!<br /><br />I believe there are consumer advocacy reporters for the local TV news stations &quot;_____ on Your Side&quot; kind of stuff. I don&#039;t watch TV though and can&#039;t name any off hand.

					Yesterday I noticed a sign up on the other side of the building on Northern and 87th/88th that has Chipoltle.&nbsp; Evidently a Denny&#039;s is coming soon. Odd fit. I always considered Denny&#039;s to be a third tier sort of diner rip off joint, and prefer actual well run local diners to chains. Curious about what they intend to do about parking, as there is no lot there.&nbsp;

					I saw an article today here:<a href="http://qns.com/story/2016/06/01/man-shot-in-the-face-outside-of-dunkin-donuts-in-jackson-heights/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"> http://qns.com/story/2016/06/01/man-shot-in-the-face-outside-of-dunkin-donuts-in-jackson-heights/</a>. There were multiple articles in the Daily News and NY Post about various shootings across town over Memorial Day weekend, all omitting this one. I was beginning to think I was crazy, had I not seen and spoke with people at the site myself. <br /><br />Having Roosevelt serve as a border between districts seems like obvious foolishness on the city&#039;s part. Edges and borders are where things are apt to fall apart due to jurisdictional/responsibility issues.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t there currently, or hasn&#039;t there been in the past a special NYPD task force that was looking at crime on Roosevelt? It could be that I am misremembering. I seem to recall reading about an anti-human trafficking push at one time. It seems like between this (probably) gang related shooting in the middle of the day and the other incidents (in Travers, tire iron attack in East Elmhurst, on Northern in the 70s)&nbsp; call for a policing response.

					Does anyone know what happened? The sidewalk was cordoned off in front of Dunkin Donuts with cops everywhere. I spoke with a news photographer who told me there was a shooting. I asked if it was at the Dunkin, but he said no, the windows were not broken. That it was on the sidewalk, where there were bullet casings. This was around 5 Sunday afternoon. He told me that it happened at 2 this afternoon. If so, I really hope noone was injured - it was a beautiful day and there surely were many people out and about. I cannot seem to find any information about this online, so I was hoping someone might know or have a link.

					She is referring to Oceanic Boil. DNAInfo did a nice write up on them today or yesterday here:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160518/jackson-heights/cajun-style-seafood-eatery-serves-crawfish-by-pound-jackson-heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160518/jackson-heights/cajun-style-seafood-eatery-serves-crawfish-by-pound-jackson-heights</a> . They sound like good folks, and worth stopping by and giving them a shot. The article mentions a near full house, but I haven&#039;t seen big crowds the times I&#039;ve walked by, although that may not have been at peak times.

					I wanted some Saw Shack for dinner tonight, but they were closed because of a gas leak according to the sign on their gate. Oceanic Boil was open next door, and looking actively for folks. Looked pretty empty. Not being a big shellfish fan, I kept walking. I was surprised that Teriyaki Factory was open. Someone was handing out samples on the sidewalk. I went in and their menus on video screens were obscured by set up screens. They told me all they were selling was chicken teriyaki and veg + rice for the moment. What I could read of the menu suggested bento boxes and dumplings of a sort, but not an extensive menu.<br /><br />I took the teriyaki chicken+ veg and rice. It was okay. Big serving for $6.15 I think. I&#039;ll go back and try to support them as they get their sea legs. It was really another kind of Saw Shack-ish take on a takeout place. The dining room was sparse, and I couldn&#039;t imagine folks really hanging around.

					Seconding Grabey&#039;s recommendation for Bicycle Repairman. Andres and his team sold me a solid city bike and have given me great service ever since. Free checkups and tuneups and always available to answer any questions I had. Pretty fast turn around and a family-run place. People who were MUCH more serious than me were often in there talking road bikes and weights and expensive stuff, but I never felt pressured to get anything I didn&#039;t need, or get ripped off by his pricing. When nice people run a place it makes it easy to recommend!<br /><br />That said, there was a nice article in the Times last year about Jimmy&#039;s Bike Shop on 93rd just north of Roosevelt.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/nyregion/queens-bike-shop-offers-repairs-and-camaraderie.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/nyregion/queens-bike-shop-offers-repairs-and-camaraderie.html</a><br /><br />Haven&#039;t used, so can&#039;t vouch for.<br /><br />

					Awesome advice Captain Flannel! I work with teenagers all day, and their behaviors. It disappoints me sometimes when I see problems that could be prevented by simple communication. Teenagers totally CAN be intimidating, but at the same time adults might generally be surprised by how they can change their behavior when they are reminded that they are sharing a space with others that could be their own sisters, mothers and other relatives. If people never say anything, the message is sent that what they are doing is acceptable. Of course everyone should take care of their own personal safety, but in general, a request to move is not met with blades and violence. If no one teaches them, how can they know?

					I&#039;ve heard him around 34th and 86th - definitely a bird and not people <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> Glad there was a sighting to confirm. One morning last week it sounded as if he was perched right outside my bathroom window hooting away at 4:30 AM. He spent a few early mornings nearby, but then I haven&#039;t heard him for a few days. He generally would get quiet around 6, any it has been getting bright earlier (finally!).&nbsp; Were you able to see any coloration, or anything that would identify the kind of owl he might be?

					Hi all,<br /><br />I moved to Jackson Heights in December and have found this board to be a great resource as I navigate my new hood. I was investigating CSAs (Community Sponsored Agriculture coop groups) to join for the Summer 2016 season. The website I find is for Farm Spot, but seems to be outdated. Does anyone know if they, or anyone else, is taking on new members for the upcoming summer?<br /><br />Many thanks in advance!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />
