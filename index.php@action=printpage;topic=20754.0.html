				Yes I was just wondering if anyone knew when it was going to open<br /><br />Michael&#039;s is overpriced and doesn&#039;t have quality art supplies (my opinion)

				&nbsp;Please support this little engine that could. JH has a lot of artists and once they are fully stocked this will be a valuable asset. Bought some terrific colored gel papers that we made a quasi stained glass project out of. They have a great assortment of card stock for original stationary and some high quality brushes that I have my eye on. Local shopping is a plus for the neighborhood and these owners are so <br />nice!

				Like bookstores do, they should give talks about art and artists in their premises. To create a community.<br />Also maybe art classes.<br /><br />Those marketing tools help independent bookstores survive. <br /><br />Maybe someone can suggest it to them. <br />

				ChickenringNYC you continue to be a delight.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the type of store I buy stuff from...I am not an artist...<br /><br />But you are so witty, I can see you are a great artist. <br /><br />Hooray for ChickenringNYC!<br /><br />

				They already had their first class on Monday night of this week - figure drawing, or at least that&#039;s what showed on their IG (I am not certain if they had it or if it got rescheduled). Also they are making room to have gallery space where they can show the work of local artists. It&#039;s not really a gallery in the traditional sense but there is wall space to hang artwork -- above the shelving areas where the supplies are displayed. So you&#039;d look up to see the work, which will hang from molding hooks supported by the existing molding.<br /><br />There is a credit card surcharge of 3% on purchases, so bring cash if it bothers you to pay a surcharge. I understand why they are passing the charge on to the customer. Otherwise the store pays the fee, or else the products have to be priced higher.
