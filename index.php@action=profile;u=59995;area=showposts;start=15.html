					OMG! This is unbelievable. <br />To think that meat fallen out of a truck and into the drain is being served at a restaurant in Jackson Heights is so gross. For the truck driver to just pick up the meat and throw it back into the truck also means that quite possibly there was cross contamination to the other meat in the truck. This is definitely a health hazard and people visiting this restaurant should beware.<br />Thanks for bringing it to the attention of this forum. <br />

					Brilliant idea!<br /><br />A STEM School for Girls would not only empower girls to succeed in Math, Technology and Science, but lead them on the pathway to pursuing sought-after careers in engineering, technology and science where they are under-represented.<br />I am very keen to put in the work to make a school like this in our community, happen.<br />Please message me and we can get this much needed project off the ground. I will support any efforts to bring the local community together with a vision for high quality education.<br /><br />Having an impact on a child&#039;s life by offering opportunities to succeed in life rests on all of us.<br />It takes a village, so please think about joining me. Message me if interested.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I know not all public schools are run like this. I know a lot of successful public schools where administrators really care for their students and encourage them in every way. But, we still have ELA and Math scores that only just make the grade. We can do better!<br /><br />I want to know if anyone in JH is interested in forming a group to discuss the idea of starting a charter school. Either located in JH or surrounding areas (District 30 or 24). My dream is to start a STEM charter school for girls but I am open to all ideas to get our neighborhood kids into better high schools and onto great colleges.<br /><br />Thoughts? Complaints? Want to form a group and get coffee so we can discuss?

It is about the 115th precinct NOT doing the job of enforcing the law they are tasked to do. Period. Just stand on 37th Avenue at almost any time of the day, and you could collect revenue from fines, that you would not have dreamed about. Forget the cameras, the slow zones, pedestrian zone, the lagging green lights. People who are in jobs to enforce the traffic laws must be held accountable. Simple.

					I am not tolerating the threatening and aggressive drivers in Jackson Heights any more....and you shouldn&#039;t either.<br /><br />This is not the first time this has happened, but it was the most aggressive driver I have encountered and it appears that it occurs almost every time I walk out of my apartment now.<br /><br />Today, I was on the crosswalk with a white walk sign (corner of 84th and 37th) when a huge SV tried to cut in front of me as I was walking. Two older ladies were also on the other side who feared crossing, despite a white walk sign. I stopped in the middle of the crosswalk to help the two old ladies to cross. The driver honked continuously and shouted something at us. He then sped off around us while I was still helping the elderly ladies across the road. <br /><br />My daughter also had a similar experience when she was walking on crosswalk a few blocks up on 37th. The driver got out of his car and got up into her face, cursing her the whole time. She was shaken. All she was doing was crossing the crosswalk on a white walk sign. No-one came to her aid despite his threatening behavior and a crowd watching on the sidewalk. <br /><br />The crosswalk makes it clear that the pedestrian has the right of way and I refuse to live in a neighborhood that is made unsafe by these drivers.<br /><br />So, I am going to:<br />1. Protect the elderly and assist them in the crosswalk if they appear to be fearful.<br />2. Stand up to the bullies on the road. Show them it is not ok to bully people who are in the crosswalk. Say something. Yes, say something that reinforces to the driver - the right of the pedestrian to walk safely in the crosswalk.<br />3. Document the aggressive driving behavior in photos and videos.<br />4. Give a smile to the driver who respects the crosswalk.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to all of us in the Jackson Heights community to take a stand and do something. The police are nowhere to be found. Please join me to make this area a safer place.<br />
