				&nbsp;In the past week, I&#039;ve observed a few restaurants here locally that seem to almost have a buzz back. Like a feeling of enough business to survive and a happy, busy atmosphere. Am wondering if this is anecdotal or are others seeing the same thing? <br />&nbsp; Felt pretty happy about it btw.<br />

				Angel has consistently good business. i stopped into al-Naimat for the first time in months today, and there were a good number of people waiting for takeout. and two tables eating in. Kitchen 79 also seems busy. Romeo&#039;s is a block or so away, and they seem to have a lot of (maybe too many) people eating in their fake outdoor seating. living on 35th, i default to going south, rather than to Northern, so i have no idea how places there are doing.

				Jax Inn was hopping Sat nite with people both dining in - us among them -- and steady stream of pick ups.&nbsp; But the chicken pot pie was AWFUL.&nbsp; I had so looked forward to it, but no effort:&nbsp; chunks of potato and chicken, a few peas and carrots, in a liquified mashed potato sauce.&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to return to making it myself.&nbsp; And $10 for a cocktail.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; At a diner?

I believe burgers, breakfast items, basic sandwiches and in the case of Jax Inn, Greek foods and Mexican foods, are good. But some of the other offerings are not good and not worth the price! Cocktails in most places now are also over priced but people seem to be paying for them so go figure. It&#039;s always been a money maker for the restaurants and might now be a financial necessity. Sorry you had that crap meal but they are reliable for burgers and the other mentioned items.

				&nbsp;Happy to see a number of restaurants doing well this week. Northern Blvd. is pretty busy and it feels like we just might be getting through this awful disease. God bless.
