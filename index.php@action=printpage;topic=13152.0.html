				I have started making targeted complaints about specific flights.&nbsp; The directions are more or less here http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=12666.msg60218#msg60218 <br />You might have to read some instructions to figure it all out, but it&#039;s actually kind of interesting.&nbsp; You can put in your home address and track flights (have to wait 20 minutes after a noisy one goes over in order to figure out which flight it was) and then see how close it was to your home at it&#039;s closest point.<br /><br />I&#039;m planning to put in a complaint for tonight, but luckily there were only 5 or so flights that I actually heard tonight, so it really wasn&#039;t too bad.

				Regarding the noise this past Saturday 3/14/15, I just noticed this message come up in the WebTrak application I posted a link to above:<br /><br /><strong>- LGA<br /><br />Runway 13/31 will be closed on 3/14/15 from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM for monthly runway repairs and construction subject to air traffic control needs and weather conditions.</strong><br /><br />I guess they fixed the runway early, since the noise was only in the morning as far as I can recall.

				This is what the Webtrak site looks like.&nbsp; I had already entered my home address, so the home icon shows where I am.&nbsp; This lists a plane that came by at 10:19 having a &quot;point of closest approach&quot; of 1631 feet.&nbsp; There is another small window that pops up (not shown in this image) where you can click on the flight number to lodge your complaint.<br /><br />Keep in mind you do have to wait 20 minutes and then click &quot;historical&quot; and input the time you want to start tracking.&nbsp; So if the noisy plane is at 10:20, then wait til at least 10:40, then go into historical mode and enter 10:20 for the time.<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/hGJLpK1.jpg)

				Thanks for the link is very helpful and allow us to file a complaint with the detail of the aircraft and flight info (not sure if it works oh well).<br /><br />Not sure if it is all the planes being shown on the map, certainly we heard it every few minutes while the site only show like few in hour.

				Would be nice if the Port Authority would give people a heads up when are going to do that. At least you could prepare for it by closing the windows and turn on a fan or AC to reduce the noise little.<br />But that requires a little respect for people by an agency known for lacking that.

				that&#039;s about right. around 1100 total flights scheduled&nbsp; per day, figure 550 of those as takeoffs. when they go over the bronx, it&#039;s clearly less intrusive for us. but as buzz said here, it&#039;s too much.

				&quot;international&quot; in an airport just means that they have customs/immigration officers on site. LGA runways aren&#039;t long enough for coast-to-coast flights, let alone flights to europe or elsewhere.

				i&#039;ve been here for 19 years, and there are years when it&#039;s more prevalent than others. this spring/summer, so far, is a bad one. i agree that it&#039;s important to complain, but, not to beat a dead horse, until we invent planes that can shoot straight up like rockets, one area or another will be affected by takeoffs from LGA. we tend to get pummeled two days every three or four weeks. our neighbors to the north and east get pummeled the other 25 days. i&#039;ll take two days versus 25. and no airplanes is really not an option for nyc. any more than no cars pr no subways.

				Yeah, I find it ridiculously annoying as well, but what are they supposed to do? If they have to close a runway for maintenance they have to divert the traffic somehow. <br /><br />I tell you, every time i&#039;m over in the shopping strip where the Waldbaum&#039;s is, there are planes low flying over that neighborhood all day every day. I don&#039;t know how they do it.

				jobs jobs jobs jobs jobs.&nbsp; We&#039;re going to concrete the world in the name of &quot;jobs&quot;.&nbsp; I think the more compelling argument is that there is a huge demand for having the airport right where it is, just like the article in the other airport thread stated.&nbsp; Even the nicest airport in the world (and I&#039;ve seen and enjoyed a few that might qualify myself) is still an airport.<br /><br />I chose to live in Jackson Heights, and the recent change in noise sucks, but the pattern has been fairly consistent over the past 15 years.&nbsp; The airport was here long before most of us, and was put where it was put for a reason.&nbsp; Sometimes convenience comes with some inconvenience.<br /><br />That being said, I agree with filing complaints anytime/everytime the traffic changes affect your eardrums.&nbsp; There may not be an adequate solution to this problem, but we don&#039;t want those in the regulating jobs to forget that we are part of the story.

				when we bought our first place here, in 1996, our broker worked for a realty in the strip next to Waldbaum&#039;s. with that as our base for looking, we saw and heard just how low and loud planes could be. we asked about regularity/annoyance, and she gave us a thumbnail look at how often we could expect it -- while acknowledging it could be horrible at times.<br />my current place, the second i&#039;ve lived in since 96, is on 35th in the mid 70s. the planes bank directly above our block and can be deafening. been sick all weekend, so the situation was particularly annoying this weekend. does it make me think twice about living here? no. has it dissuaded the four or five friends i&#039;ve had move here from brooklyn/manhattan? no.&nbsp; different strokes, i guess.

				The planes were very loud this morning flying over 74/35th, I rarely hear it on 80/35th where I also live. I met a lady in JuJu&#039;s this morning-she is not on this board but she is very adamant with getting this taken care of, I believe she has submitted hundreds of letters to councilman/senators but to no avail...<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t bother me that much, granted I wake up early regardless plus my summer home is near JFK&#039;s flight paths so I can&#039;t win but I will sign the complaint too.

				So, across the US, 450 people per year are projected to die early deaths from flight-related pollution. <br /><br />Compare this to the TOTAL in the USA of 200,000 early deaths per year from air pollution!<br /><br />Less than 0.3% of the deaths due to air pollution are due to aviation. <br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.voanews.com/content/air-pollution-linked-to-early-death/1739804.html<br /><br />Similar likelihoods occur with health impacts. Essentially negligible.<br /><br />The badly tuned diesel garbage truck or delivery lorry idling on your street ONE time probably exposes you to more PM50s than all the flights out of LGA combined.<br /><br />One ship which runs spectacularly dirty diesel engines that are not controlled due to the vagaries of maritime law probably puts out more PM50s than Delta&#039;s entire fleet at LGA. <br /><br />Sorry; &quot;fumes&quot; are not a real issue for us in JH. They are way down the list for virtually anyone else in comparison with other sources of pollution.<br />

				Jet fumes are full of benzene and many other dangerous particulates, which cause cancer, asthma, and COPD, among other diseases. Here&#039;s one study from Boston&#039;s Logan Airport: http://www.universalhub.com/2014/study-finds-elevated-lung-problems-near-logan<br />I smell the fumes in Jackson Heights often when the planes are frequent and low (and loud).<br /><br />Today&#039;s horrible, all day/evening barrage of extreme, repetitive noise of airplanes flying unnecessarily low, loud and frequent, so close to our rooftops, should be illegal. It&#039;s damaging in so many ways. I fill out the Noise Complaint very often. The FAA&#039;s new NEXT GEN computer system has fairly recently been programmed to skim our neighborhood rooftops (and nature areas) now, and groups all over the country are fighting them, and some are winning, such as Phoenix, AZ.<br /><br />Let&#039;s fight; we&#039;re New Yorkers! Queens Quiet Skies is a good place to start. And keep complaining on that link or phone # and to your representatives; the more complaints, the more they&#039;ll have to pay attention!<br />

				Here’s the link to your study (your link did not link to the original report)<br /><br />http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/environmental/investigations/logan/logan-airport-health-study-final.pdf<br /><br />The key finding, not shown in news reports about the study&nbsp; but pasted direct from the link above:<br /><em><br />Although higher prevalences of current and probable asthma were observed in the high exposure area in crude, univariate, analyses (Table 6.5), when potential confounding factors were controlled for in this analysis, no differences were observed across the high, medium, and low exposure areas for the likelihood of current or probable asthma. …Tests of trend were not significant for any of the targeted respiratory outcomes.</em><br /><br />—<br /><br />Look:<br /><br />&nbsp;i) I hate the noise, particularly the fact that it is imposed without notice or consultation.<br /><br />ii) You get dozens of times more exposure to benzene by filling your gas tank once at a gas station than having planes fly over you all day.<br /><br />iii) the serious health study you cite says this: as soon as they take into account&nbsp; other health, economic factors and proximity to roads, ALL THE&nbsp; OUTCOMES become statistically insignificant - in other words, they couldn’t detect any effect on asthma, COPD or any health effects different from the background of living in a city.<br /><br />As soon as you make this about “fumes” being “unhealthy”&nbsp; in an urban environment where cars, lorries, and many other ground pollution sources <strong>completely</strong> dominate health impacts, you deflect from the real, addressable problem.........which is the noise.<br /><br />

				A few facts about the noise this past weekend: <br /><br />The link below shows data from the PA&#039;s own noise meters. Last Saturday the noise was consistently around 90-100 decibels. For comparison, the city&#039;s noise limit is 60 decibels. A normal conversation happens at about 30-40 decibels.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The graph also shows the frequency of airplanes and their trajectory. It&#039;s pretty jarring, actually, to see that the area was subjected to 90 decibel noise every minute and a half on average. <br /><br />But what&#039;s more interesting is that our area is assigned &quot;medium&quot; tolerance to noise, whereas, say, the area around Teterboro is &quot;low&quot; tolerance. I find this baffling, given that JH is a lot more populated. <br /><br />http://webtrak5.bksv.com/panynj4

				I say keep complaining, loudly and in public!<br /><br />Seriously though, I think JHers are accustomed to the landing path over Nothern and the low 70s a couple days a week, engines are mostly idle, not as loud. It&#039;s those runway 22 takeoffs heading southwest that then turn left over all of JH that are a problem. There are four ways you can take off from LGA, three are over water, the other is over us.

				HAM, the plane noise that your partner heard over the last two decades was the type we normally get that is not all that loud or bothersome.&nbsp; The real noise comes when the path changes to have departures from runway 22, like luckyghost wrote earlier.&nbsp; That is a new change over the last few years which is why it&#039;s so miserable in the lower 70s when that happens. On those days, my dishes shake in their cabinets every 45 seconds and I can&#039;t open my windows. People can hear it over the phone with my windows closed.&nbsp; I&#039;m allowed to be annoyed by that.

				The airports have implemented new technology which has changed plane departure/arrival routes in the past couple of years.<br /><br />And that is why airplane noise is worse now over Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Is the only recourse we have as a community... to gather and take this matter to the courts and thus force the Port Authority to stop cruelly torturing us with airplane noise?

				It&#039;s not about closing the airport for me. I am painfully aware of where I stand in relation to Port Authority, LGA, the FAA, the airlines and passengers, etc. It is about the changed flight paths at the expense of, and with absolutely no regard for, the communities underneath. I&#039;m no expert, but in reading about about what&#039;s going on with the new flight path in Flushing, it seems that all the old routes that were there and used for noise mitigation are not being used anymore in favor of the new satellite system route.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, the Port Authority is also considering changing the rule to allow larger, longer flight jets in and out of LGA, as well as doing away with the &quot;voluntary curfew&quot; that limits air traffic between midnight and 6am.<br /><br />I’m not sure if it’s been posted before, but this is a good site for more information for those who are bothered by the noise and/or interested in the big picture. There’s a lot going on in other cities too with the new air traffic system that’s also causing such grief in Queens. There’s a link right on top to a story about the situation in Phoenix, which is suing the FAA over changed flight paths.<br /><br />http://nextgennoise.org<br /><br />

				that NYT editorial is typically anti-outer borough.<br /><br />lifting the rule is a terrible idea. more noise, more congestion, more delays, more negatives. but more money for airlines and more convenience for a few manhattan travelers.

				To boldly go where no man has gone before...<br /><br />Stewart Airport Long Island with a fast train built to NYC would be the answer.<br />With a high speed train...you could get there in 30 mins.&nbsp; Probably less time than it takes to get to LGA by public transport from Midtown.<br /><br />Times have changed. Folks won&#039;t put up with noise pollution like they did in the past. Just like in the old days folks put up with horse manure in the streets...until the subways and cars changed that.<br /><br />When LGA was envisioned...in the 1930&#039;s there would&#039;ve been a handful of propeller planes per day.&nbsp; <br />Now there are jets screaming in and out every 30 seconds or so.<br /><br />It is untenable for that situation to continue in a crowded city.<br /><br />Other cities, around the globe and nationally, have had exactly the same problems.<br />And taken the airports to court AND WON THE CASE.<br /><br />I imagine that the airports know very well there are legal precedents, internationally and nationally, in the case of severe noise pollution being detrimental to the health of communities.<br /><br />And that legally, should they be taken to court they could easily lose.<br /><br />So I am not certain where the &quot;put up with it&quot; attitude comes from.<br /><br />This is a democracy and we can fight for our rights.<br /><br />Again, I repeat, times have changed...and folks are empowered these days concerning their rights, particularly health-wise. <br /><br />Also I believe in the Blitz...they would&#039;ve been propeller planes...far quieter than the ear splitting jet engines...of today. So they probably had it less noisy than us! <br /><br />...And to quote from Star Trek...“You either believe in yourself or you don’t.”<br /><br />It&#039;s time for LGA to move.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

But the plans always fail because our utterly corrupt, incompetent state government is completely incapable of building high-speed rail lines. Also Stewart wouldn&#039;t get Queens or Long Island traffic, which would either overcrowd JFK or we&#039;d need to pump up Macarthur - and there we would run into the killer political clout of Suffolk County.

				Just came back from farmer market, funny how everyone just cover up the ear or pause when they in the middle of conversation everytime a plane flew by which is like every 2 to 5 minutes. My ear is bleeding, lol, can we all send the medical bill to PA for hearing exam or hearing problem...:).<br /><br />How much more capacity will LGA be able to handle after they redo the airport, I do think is wasted, the money could be use for other airports or new airport that have more room to expand.<br /><br />And regarding to the webtrck complaint website, is compleyely BS. Clearly PA just waste money to have a tool for public to complaint so we feel better about it, that we did something about the issue. Why do they need people to manually complaint when they can easily extract the data on the plane info, the location, the time and the the noise level from the&nbsp; monitor. Or they just testing us see how much noise we can tolerate... ;), if no one complaint then they will increase the traffic and fly lower.

The Tappan Zee replacement is botched, with no transit option on it; there will be no tunnel to New Jersey; it takes seven-plus hours to get to Plattsburgh by train because the CP Adirondack tracks are only rated for 15 miles an hour; and how late is that 7 train extension?<br /><br />You could argue that the lack of any rail connection to LGA proves your point - that when Queens voters say no, they can stop projects. Astoria said no, so we have no train to LGA. But shutting down LGA with no decent alternative capacity would be an economic disaster, and we can&#039;t build the alternative capacity.

				Let me get this straight.&nbsp; We should close the airport, which directly and indirectly generates hundreds of local jobs, many of which are &quot;blue collar,&quot; and replace it with a flower market or 3d printing facility?&nbsp; And the workers, if they want to keep their jobs, will have to commute roundtrip every day to Newburgh, NY on a high speed rail link that does not exist.<br /><br />Have you spoken to the hotel workers, the rental car employees, the people who deliver food, the ticket agents or anyone else about this.&nbsp; Should we do away with the 7 train next. <br /><br />I&#039;ve said this before, we live next to an airport.&nbsp; Everyone who lives here knew that when they decided to move in.

				I don&#039;t really care if there&#039;s more traffic coming in and out of LGA (I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be seeing a third runway built, in any case) so long as they&#039;re not takeoffs from runway 22, which are the ones that are hard on JH. The port authority webtrak site (http://webtrak5.bksv.com/panynj4) lists all the runway closures for the upcoming week, and all the Saturday-into-Sunday issues we&#039;ve been having are due to periodic maintenance on runway 13/33, the one that runs east/west. I&#039;m interested if that maintenance will be chronic or is part of a plan with an actual completion date.<br /><br />Now, why they have to take off on 22 as opposed to 4 which puts them out over the water I have no idea, perhaps some combo of wind direction and coordination with other area airports. I also can&#039;t account for the recent spate of weeknight 10pm-11pm takeoffs. The webtrak site is helpful to know what&#039;s coming though... if you see runway 4/22 will be closed for maintenance you know you can sleep in that weekend.

				From what I&#039;ve learned about this issue so far it seems that the Queens Borough President, Melinda Katz, may be an important advocate.&nbsp; She is part of the group that is advising the LGA renovation.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve heard that she is well aware of the plane noise issue in Queens, I think it would be helpful or her hear from many people from Jackson Heights about the problem.&nbsp; I included a link below for the form to contact her office.&nbsp; Just click the box to the lower left to &quot;file an issue.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />http://queensbp.org/contact-qbp/

				Hello there...<br /><br />I have not disappeared...but am simply pondering the best modus operandi...to approach this airplane noise issue...<br /><br />Yes, forming a group that tackles it is a fine idea...<br /><br />The thing is... I went to that meeting @ the high school PS69, a couple of years ago...concerning airplane noise and how it has increased in Jax Hts due to that new technology they&#039;re using....enabling planes to land/depart within 30 seconds or whatever of each other...in exactly the same route...which is why there is a barrage of jets over our heads...in almost precisely the same way each time.<br /><br />At the meeting the authorities promised to consider our community&#039;s concerns.<br /><br />My true feeling now...after a couple of years...is the method the Port Authority uses to consider our concerns... is to determine how much plane noise we put up with...in other words, how much they can get away with. <br /><br />So the more we complain, I suppose, the more they realize the less we&#039;ll put up with it.<br /><br />Really, however, my guess... is that they will only truly sit up and take notice if legal action is taken. Because I bet the Port Authority is fearful that if airports are forced to curtail their jet noise pollution by the courts...like other precedents that have been achieved around the nation, the courts would discover that the noise decibels we must put up with are so high they would be illegal. The Port Authority would be forced to insulate 100&#039;s? or 1000&#039;s? of apartments...very expensive.<br /><br />And the trouble, of course, is that NYC needs jets to zoom in and out...to compete in the world...and it&#039;s the circular argument again of a magnificent 24/7 airport worthy of this city (Stewart Airport!) ...or continuing with these band-aid solutions which cause pain...and operate at illegal decibel levels for neighborhoods.<br /><br />I was also thinking about how some folks want to be good neighbors with LGA.&nbsp; I do understand that. <br />The trouble is LGA&#039;s technology has changed...in the last 3 years... and our neighbor LGA is now making so much noise... that if other neighbors created such a disturbance...the situation would end up with the police being called...and the neighbors fined.<br /><br />To love a neighbor who is abusing us, due to new technology which allows departing/landing jets to follow the exact same routes with only a minute or so intervals between them...is in my opinion akin to suffering from &quot;battered wife syndrome&quot;. Loving the very thing that has quite recently began abusing us far worse than it used to.<br /><br />I will keep considering this issue...and which option/path might be the best to follow... It is pretty complicated.<br /><br />Life, after all, is choices...and we all should have them...in a free country.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Having just taken the comfortable train from downtown Milano to Malpensa ($12 Euro, 40 minutes), I can appreciate the allure of Stewart as an alternative.&nbsp; That NYC&#039;s &quot;train to the plane&quot; ranks as one of the sorriest among world class cities makes it more appealing.&nbsp; But the building of the tunnel which would have the high speed train cross the Hudson alone would be a herculean effort, let alone upgrading the Hudson River Line, condemning the needed land and, of course, building an international airport (unless Monty Burns really wants to get his kid into Columbia instead of Harvard).&nbsp; <br /><br />I still look longingly at the 1929 RPA Transportation Plan (a subway on Northern Boulevard!) and while it&#039;s never bad to do the best you can to make some of it a reality, moving LGA to Stewart is not presently a viable alternative.&nbsp; Even if it were, I&#039;d wager a fair number of us would be dead before any fruit fell from the tree.<br /><br />I think a viable avenue to push down is noise reduction from the planes themselves.&nbsp; NASA is getting in on it:&nbsp; http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/aug/HQ_05213_Noise_reduction.html<br /><br />[/quote]<br />* City, not state, control of the MTA<br />* Disbanding the Port Authority to remove its bi-state paralysis<br />* Making rail a priority in statewide infrastructure creation (as opposed to Cuomo building a rail-free Tappan Zee)<br />* Indicting and removing every NY state legislator getting kickbacks from current real estate interests<br />[/quote]<br /><br />* City control of the MTA might be problematic, as who would run the commuter lines and would the state still have to kick in its subsidies?<br />* The Port Authority is a dinosaur, but given the integration of NY and NJ some sort of bi-state creature is needed to run our ports and interstate crossings.<br />* 100% agree.&nbsp; Raise the gas tax to reduce people&#039;s incentive to drive and generate money for mass transit capital projects and subsidize operating costs.&nbsp; In Western Europe, taxes make the price of gas about 4 times what we pay.&nbsp; If they can stomach it, so can we.&nbsp; <br />* I&#039;ll supply the tar and feathers.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the article...<br /><br />So, basically, another factor is if we wait 10 years...the plane noise MAY POSSIBLY be decreased by half due to a new jet design.<br /><br />Ten years.<br /><br />Hmmmm....<br /><br />The only upside of all this...is that I have become more knowledgeable about planes and airports... than I ever imagined I&#039;d be.<br /><br />And no doubt there&#039;s far more to be learned... in this multi-factorial challenge...that reaches from the top echelons of entrenched government and community habits to me...being woken up at 6am on a weekend to be bombarded by endlessly screaming jets...in my ear...driving me crazy. <br /><br />

				i thoroughly appreciate your passion here, but playing the practicality card here:<br /><br />you (correctly) express frustration about waiting ten years for a *possible* reduction in plane noise. but you are proposing a solution that would take two or three times as long to implement -- in terms of building a rail link to stewart and then modernizing that airport. three times may be charitable, after all, ground was broken on the second avenue subway just over 60 years ago.<br /><br />what will be done between now and 2038 or so?

				Yes that&#039;s the point.<br /><br />Unfortunately my timing ain&#039;t the best...to be exactly here...in Jax Hts...specifically (and only) concerning this particular plane noise issue...

				Is it clear how they count &quot;household&quot;? I have heard many more than 10 people complain very vociferously, so I&#039;m wondering if street address is considered a household. Obviously that would be very silly given that a single address might have 60-80 apartments, but otherwise it just doesn&#039;t make any sense. <br /><br />But it seems pretty nasty to use those 10 activists to downplay the problem.<br /><br />The more important number to my mind is the 1290 households that have complained. That seems like a pretty large number -- I figure for every 5-10 people who are upset, maybe 1 complains (totally making up these numbers -- do we have any sociologists on this list who study such things?).<br />

				If you read the full article, you will see that the Port Authority representative is trying to downplay the number of complaints by claiming that most of them are coming from a few households. Plus, it seems that they count multiple complaints from a single household as a single complaint.<br /><br />So those of us who post complaints regularly might want to shift our strategy -- post once per household, and spend any leftover energy persuading neighbors who are also upset about it to send in their complaints as well. <br /><br />I know lots of people who feel upset about the noise but who don&#039;t post, so now I know what I have to do!

				My understanding is that the plane noise has been much more frequent because there is a construction project happening on the runway that is normally used for take offs.&nbsp; I think it has something to due with upgrading the runway to comply with safety regulations.&nbsp; Can anyone confirm that this is the case?&nbsp; Is there an elected official who can inform us about this?&nbsp; It would be so helpful to know that there is an end date to this problem.&nbsp;

				This thread is so strange to me because I am SO sensitive to noise, upstairs neighbor noise (not a problem now, I am on top floor), however, the plane noise does not bother me, I barely notice it, I always wonder, if we complain and they move, won&#039;t it hurt someone else&#039;s quality of life? Probably people who are unable to be activists like JH people.&nbsp; The planes aren&#039;t here all of the time, and we are super close to an incredibly busy airport.&nbsp; I mean, it was inevitable.&nbsp; &nbsp;:) It could be worse and it will probably get better soon.

				Yes, better soundproofing is a must. These planes fly literally down my street (mid 70&#039;s). I flew out of LGA a couple of weeks ago and could make out my apartment and many other neighborhood buildings. <br />Today the planes started around 6am, there is a plane nearly every minute. Even with our double paned windows and the AC on we can hear them. We can&#039;t watch a movie without keeping our finger on the pause button and keeping the captions on. It&#039;s hard to make phone calls because there are always planes overhead. It&#039;s a major quality of life issue.

				I got a long-ish voice message yesterday from someone from the Port Authority of NY and NY who said he was calling in response to a complaint I had made (about a month ago) on their hotline (I was so disappointed to have missed that call).&nbsp; He expressed thanks for my use of the hotline and said that the more calls that are made, the more visible the trend of noise disturbance becomes.&nbsp; He further told me the info from such complaints are analysed and shared with &quot;senior staff&quot; and the FAA, and that I could look into the &quot;Part 150 studies&quot; that are ongoing regarding noise issues from Laguardia and JFK.&nbsp; I assume he means the &quot;Technical Advisory Committee&quot; that the Port Authority formed to study existing and future aircraft noise exposure levels.<br /><br />I have to say, I was AMAZED that an actual human being acknowledged the noise complaint I had logged with the Port Authority.&nbsp; This alone will motivate me to log in more noise complaints for sure and I hope it encourages others, too.<br /><br />Also, I would really like to study the Federal Code of Regulations Part 150 on Airport Noise Compatibility Planning (which looks unrelentingly tedious even for a rules geek like me):&nbsp; http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f8e6df268e3dad2edb848f61b9a0fb51&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt14.3.150&amp;rgn=div5<br /><br />to really understand what the framework is and how to leverage it.&nbsp; I&#039;m also considering taking the afternoon off from work to attend the next Technical Advisory Committee meeting that&#039;s currently schedule at LaGuardia for October 7.&nbsp; Port Authority has circulated a notice that says &quot;Space for the TAC meetings will be limited. However, it will be open to the public&quot;.<br /><br />Unfortunately, members of the public are also &quot;asked to refrain&quot; from commenting during TAC member discussions. But I&#039;d like to go 1) to figure out how Port Authority is actually dealing with this on an official/legal/administrative level and 2) to show that members of &quot;the public&quot; are disturbed enough and care enough to show up.&nbsp; If anyone else can take the time to attend and we can put in a good showing, that might make an impression somehow.&nbsp; In any case, if I can make it, I&#039;ll post my report of what went on at the meeting.<br /><br />Thank you, venicepapa, for providing the information for the town and district reps. I think a meeting at St. Mark&#039;s would be terrific and I would do everything possible to be there.

				Thank you, Cassat, for this very informative post.<br /><br />I just briefly skimmed the Federal Code of Regulations Part 150 on Airport Noise Compatibility Planning, and this section seems pertinent (and slightly unnerving):<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><br />&quot;Airport Noise Exposure. The yearly day-night average sound level (YDNL) must be employed for the analysis and characterization of multiple aircraft noise events and for determining the cumulative exposure of individuals to noise around airports.&quot;</span><br /><br />Since it is the <span class="bbc_u">yearly</span> average, perhaps this means the airport could inundate us with flights every weekend of the year --- just so long as the majority of the time (<em>i.e.</em>, weekdays and also 11 p.m. to 8 a.m.) it is quiet enough to keep Jackson Heights&#039; Yearly Day-Night Average Sound Level under whatever the legal threshold is.<br /><br />

I see this useless argument way too often.&nbsp; What does this hope to achieve?&nbsp; Are you okay with the noise?&nbsp; Do you want more noise? NYC used to have a high murder rate.&nbsp; Should we have accepted that and told complainers that they should&#039;ve known what they were getting into. <br />&nbsp;Continuous, loud airplane noise for days at a time is not a given in JH or other nearby communities.&nbsp; There are ways to minimize this. We know it depends on scheduling, sizes of aircraft permitted and other factors.&nbsp; We know it depends on human decisions.&nbsp; It is not a result of omnipotent force. We know it is not a zero sum game. We know it is detrimental to the health of residents.&nbsp; &nbsp;If no one complains, and it doesn&#039;t factor into future planning it could get much worse with the new LGA expansion instead of getting better.

				This is a thread for folks complaining about the changes in airplane routes that have been implemented in the last few years...due to the new GPS based technology utilized by planes landing and departing from LGA... which enables planes to fly exactly the same route, with a separation of only a minute or so...and is a brand spanking novel ear-shattering development...and annoyance.<br /><br />Does that make it clearer for you JHLIFER35?

				It&#039;s really NOT a departure corridor is the thing... I mean it can be if needed, but it&#039;s generally avoided for, yes, noise abatement issues. Runway maintenance seems like it&#039;s been the main culprit, and I hope it&#039;s true that projects are due to wrap up in September.

				From an email sent by Danny Dromm&#039;s office this morning:<br /><br />Over the past two years Jackson Heights has seen a change to flight patterns in and out of LaGuradia Airport that has negatively impacted our quality of life.&nbsp; As a resident of 78th Street, I am personally aware of how much these changes have affected our community.&nbsp; In recent months you contacted my office to ask that I take action to change this situation.&nbsp; I write to you now to give you some information about the steps I have taken to reduce the impact of these changes on our neighborhood and to explain the limitations on the City’s ability to regulate aircraft noise. <br />&nbsp;<br />In response to increased airplane noise, in 2013 I held a community forum that was attended by representatives from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration, community members and Queens Quiet Skies, a local organization working to reduce the impact of airplane noise on our community.&nbsp; This meeting lead to an increased dialogue between the community and the FAA and Port Authority, including regular updates from the Port Authority about changes to flight patterns.&nbsp; In addition I have helped bring this issue to the attention of the media and in May of this year joined with Queens Quiet Skies at the Jackson Heights Green Market to sign up new members. I believe that this kind of community advocacy is the only way we are going to solve this problem. <br />&nbsp;<br />Some of you have asked that I attempt to apply local noise ordinances to the problem or create new legislation to prohibit the noise from occurring at certain times.&nbsp; As a resident who is experiencing the same frustrations over this disruption in our quality of life, I understand the impulse to ask for these changes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, passing laws to prevent aircraft noise is simply not within the power of the City Council.&nbsp; In the 1970s the Supreme Court determined that in matters involving aircraft noise the powers of the federal government take precedence over the local governments like the New York City Council.&nbsp; What this means in practice is that any existing or new city noise laws as applied to the airlines or airports are simply unenforceable.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I know that this information is disheartening but there is still some good news.&nbsp; In the last few months we have experienced increased noise almost every weekend.&nbsp; My office has been told by the Port Authority that this is a temporary change.&nbsp; According to the Port Authority federally mandated safety upgrades have required changing flight patterns on weekends.&nbsp; These upgrades are meant to be fully completed by the end of 2015.&nbsp; This does not mean that we will see a complete absence of noise from planes flying in and out of LaGuardia but it does mean that we should see a significant reduction of noise in the next few months. <br />&nbsp;<br />For now the best thing that we can do as a community is to support and work with Queens Quiet Skies to advocate for reduced noise from LaGuardia in our neighborhood.&nbsp; My office will continue to offer the organization the support it needs to carry on its very important work.&nbsp; If you would like to donate time or resources to the organization or would simply like to learn more about this issue, please visit www.queensquietskies.org.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Because of our advocacy, Jackson Heights has logged the highest number of complaints with the Port Authority as this DNAinfo article points out. Here is a link to the DNAinfo article: https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150820/jackson-heights/jackson-heights-tops-list-of-airport-noise-complaints<br />&nbsp;<br />I am also working closely with Congressman Joseph Crowley, Congresswoman Grace Meng, Senator José Peralta, Senator Toby Ann Stavisky, Assemblyman Michael DenDekker, Assemblyman Francisco Moya&nbsp; and Council Member Julissa Ferreras on this issue.<br />&nbsp;<br />I hope that this information has been helpful to you. Please know that my staff and I are here to answer any questions you might have, however, complaints about specific noise should be directed to the Port Authority at (800) 225-1071 or online at http://www.panynj.gov.

				To answer DSSJH&#039;s question: we first moved to JH Nov 81 and stayed throughout the eighties. Aircraft noise due to planes taking off over JH, similar to what we experience weekly today, occurred perhaps twice a year then, due to runway closures for maintenance. <br /><br />Back then we complained about planes landing into La Guardia when it was rainy or foggy, but the noise and disruption was nothing compared to what we have today.

				Just to add another complaint...last night (9/10) there were&nbsp; few planes that took off around 11:30pm and flew directly over 75th/76th St. I&#039;m getting more used to the plane noise (unfortunately) but having planes that loud overhead at that time of night is kind of ridiculous. I guess that maybe flights were delayed due to the storms yesterday; I really hope that this isn&#039;t part of a larger pattern of evening flights taking off with this flight pattern.

				No one hates the noise more than me...I think. But don&#039;t be fool. Every neighborhood has its share.&nbsp; The property values are pretty high in Howard Beach and there the noise is a consistent unrelenting event.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see people fleeing from there. I was at a meeting in Grammacy yesterday and there the noise consisted of fire trucks and construction throughout the day.&nbsp; Yes the plane noise is quite disturbing, unbearable at times especially when coupled with blaring radio music from cars. leaf blowers and lawn mowers.

				I may have missed it in previous posts on this thread but is there an easy way to get a forecast of when they intend to do flyovers?&nbsp; Will make planning weekends away much easier.<br /><br />A side note : Spent few weekends this summer in Venice beach and drove right by LAX a few times. 747s taking off directly over the car at a much lower altitude than the planes over 34th ave here.&nbsp; For some reason seemed much quieter.&nbsp; Could hear the radio,&nbsp; have a regular conversation etc.&nbsp; there must be something in the air here.&nbsp; Maybe they are taking off at a steeper initial climb?

				Just for the record, the first one I heard this morning was at 5:56 AM as I recall. They were sparse for awhile but now quite frequent. Also I notice that there&#039;s no announcement from the Port Authority on WebTrak, which is disturbing. In the past I&#039;ve noticed such announcements (runway work this weekend etc). <br /><br />If it helps at all, neighbors who&#039;ve been here much longer tell me it&#039;s been common for some years to have aircraft noise on Saturdays.

They&#039;re unpopular with airlines except for on super-long-haul routes, because they&#039;re fuel inefficient. This comment is already nonsense because most planes at LaGuardia - most planes in the sky - are twinjets (two engines). Trijets (three engines) are considered to be an older, generally obsolete design.<br /><br />Now, yes, you could land a 747 on LaGuardia&#039;s 7,000-foot runway. And if you google for videos, you will see that airlines have. No additional work needed. You could do it tomorrow. But if airlines want to fly transatlantic into LGA, they could do it with 757s, 777s, or 787s, all twinjets. Nobody is talking about flying A380s into LGA.<br /><br />So this whole thing about &quot;number of engines&quot; sounds silly. It&#039;s probably a mistake based on the real fact that airlines are talking about flying transatlantic into LGA, made by someone who hasn&#039;t flown in 30 years and so who thinks long-haul means L-1011s and 747s.<br /><br />And yes, airlines are talking about flying transatlantic into the &quot;new LGA&quot; (they can&#039;t do it until the renovation because, no customs and no secure area.)

				Obviously &quot;theplanesland&quot; is a troll working for the FAA or someone with skin in the game. Don&#039;t call people silly and try and disprove what obviously is a problem for the neighborhood or are these 14 pages of complaints just no big deal? Maybe change your name if you want any credibility. To say that a suit is ridiculous is ridiculous. They are breaking basic laws of noise pollution and damaging the quality of life for the residents here. When the planes are taking off over the neighborhood from 5am until midnight, I cannot sleep I cannot sit and relax in my house not walk around the neighborhood it&#039;s so loud. This is unreasonable and should be addressed with more vigor. Why change up the flight patterns when it hasn&#039;t been this way for decades? <br /><br />It has already been said many times there aren&#039;t enough noise monitors at LGA so why not? If it&#039;s true there isnt one on 37th maybe they&#039;re flying over my house on 76th because there aren&#039;t any? Other communities have fought this and won (Santa Cruz) so why can&#039;t we get a proper monitoring system?

Don&#039;t call people silly and try and disprove what obviously is a problem for the neighborhood or are these 14 pages of complaints just no big deal? Maybe change your name if you want any credibility. To say that a suit is ridiculous is ridiculous. They are breaking basic laws of noise pollution and damaging the quality of life for the residents here. When the planes are taking off over the neighborhood from 5am until midnight, I cannot sleep I cannot sit and relax in my house not walk around the neighborhood it&#039;s so loud. This is unreasonable and should be addressed with more vigor. Why change up the flight patterns when it hasn&#039;t been this way for decades? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Claiming that planes landing at LGA currently have three engines is untrue and shows little knowledge of aviation. Claiming that four-engine planes will be landing there soon is probably untrue. On the other hand, saying, for instance, that there will be more long-haul traffic coming into LGA after the renovation - using two-engine planes - is a good bet, and if you want to be angry about expanded traffic at LGA, that&#039;s something to be angry about.<br /><br />I&#039;m just trying to keep people realistic and grounded (ha, ha) here. What are these &quot;basic laws of noise pollution?&quot; Are they like the basic laws of physics? Did you know that in 2012 Congress exempted NextGen-related changes from environmental review? [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/faa-new-air-traffic-control-system-nextgen-causing-major-noise-pollution/]<br /><br />Rather than say &quot;rar rar rar LAWSUIT&quot; with no apparent actual clues or specifics (hint: &quot;I don&#039;t like this&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;it&#039;s illegal&quot;) I think it&#039;s more productive to focus on things we can actually do. For instance, keep up the pressure on Danny Dromm to address this, which he&#039;s doing. It would be great if we could escalate this to make sure Congressman Crowley is on the case, as the FAA is federally regulated. Governor Cuomo, via the Port Authority, controls LaGuardia. He&#039;s an awful human, but maybe there&#039;s some pressure that can be placed there.<br /><br />I, too, hate waking up at 6am to the airplane takeoffs - and yes, I live right under them too. I&#039;d like to do something about it other than forming an incoherent mob based on false assumptions and mystical shibboleths about &quot;lawsuits.&quot;

EPA had pre-empted lower levels of government from regulating sources, so states could not legislate standards such as for truck noise emissions. Thus, in areas where the federal government had failed to promulgate clear standards (such as aircraft noise), no further progress could be made except by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has an inherent conflict of interest regarding noise regulation.&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_regulation#Follow-up_on_initial_U.S._laws<br /><br />But there may be other laws in the long list of laws I linked above that are more relevant. More importantly, it would be nice if an actual lawyer who had an actual clue could opine.

				it is a very good idea. without sounding like the old fogey yet again, we had a LOT of those shortly after Rep. Crowley took office, maybe one every 4-6 weeks. he was very receptive, very good at listening, but not a lot came of it (although things did quiet down for a few years). there was a woman, whose name escapes me at the moment, who lived near the landing lights park and seemed to be the linchpin of a lot of the activity.

				What about asking PA to expense medical bill for hearing issue, or depression due to constantly loud noise or vibrating every few minutes, (some of the worst day is like living in a war zone, excuse my exaggeration&nbsp; :-\).<br /><br />I wish this is something mandatory that the broker list the property is in the <strong>current</strong> flight paths, definitely something would factor when buying.

Dssjh points out that the last time this was an issue, that happened and then things quieted down for a while. That&#039;s my experience too; I&#039;ve been in the neighborhood for eight years, and this has really only been bad since the runway reconstruction thing started less than a year ago.

				I got an email with this petition today so hopefully at least some here will want to sign it.&nbsp; &quot;It asks for help from our congressional reps around the country to support many of the same issues raised in the recent Letter from the House Congressional caucus to the House Subcommittee on Transportation.&quot;<br /><br />https://www.change.org/p/members-of-congress-urge-congress-to-adopt-regulations-to-reduce-airplane-noise?recruiter=31196273&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=share_email_responsive<br /><br />As far as politicians, I think Crowley might be part of the caucus they mentioned above. He is definitely a supporter so it&#039;s worth keeping him up to date on how many of his constituents support his efforts on airplane noise reduction. From what I&#039;ve gathered, we <em>really</em> need attention and support from Senators Schumer and Gillibrand in order to gain some traction.<br /><br />In my opinion, Melinda Katz is the key figure on the local level so everyone who is inclined should be in touch with her office.

				likewise up since six. walked over to woodside to do some errands mid morning and noticed that things seem the very worst between 73rd or so and the BQE....maybe that&#039;s a place where planes bank or something ... but above our place on 76th, it&#039;s deafening.<br /><br />hoping Rep.

				This is tre message I sent to all representatives on the links posted above. (Thanks for posting!)<br /><br />I am a resident of Jackson Heights, Queens, NY. Writing to ask that you please take action to stop the plane noise from Laguardia airport. It&#039;s been madening. My wife wants us to move. I woke up at 6am today, a saturday, because of it. It&#039;s happening every weekend. It didnt use to be this way. As far as I&#039;m concerned, Laguardia should be closed and turned into a park. It was built when Queens was a farway place and now more than 500,000 people live near it. Please take leadership on this issue. Thanks for your work!

She is the Queens Borough President, a member of that new airport advisory panel and has heavy involvement with the Part 150 noise study and so on:<br /><br />718-286-3000<br />info@queensbp.org<br />@MelindaKatz on Twitter<br /><br />Submit a constituent issue on the BP site:<br />https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sXbO4UPoGa8mPOdafkmetlnGXACwxhyGbyFI4qj3H30/viewform<br /><br />Joseph Crowley is very familiar with the airport noise issue and already on the case. He is a member of Congressional Quiet Skies Caucus to Combat Aircraft Noise, etc He even tweeted that recent article about Jackson Heights leading noise complaints to Port Authority.<br /><br />We need the support of Senators Schumer and Gillibrand !

				a rally is a good idea. but it would take hundreds -- if not thousands -- of people to shut down LGA. and the actions needed to really shut it (blocking access, for instance) are fairly serious federal crimes (not like the protests of Occupy Wall Street).

				I have been noticing the aircrafts that fly over, they all seem to be private jets or smaller style airplanes most likely housing the elite or 1% or whoever else is inside. And I am pretty sure they don&#039;t give a flying f*** about us. <br /><br />Closing the airport is a little extreme, I don&#039;t know the answer to this problem but we live next to an airport, what do you expect will happen? All I know is that I accept the things I cannot change and I am okay with that. My dad was a labor organizer for PanAm/TWU for 40 years before they went bankrupt. He organized rallies at JFK, sit downs like you guys are suggested and was arrested/fined, nothing really changed. <br /><br />I am not trying to troll but what do you guys think is worse: the noise below the 7train every 30-45 seconds or the plane noise? Living/walking under the 7 is winning for me. I cannot imagine living on Roosie dealing with that everyday. That is why I do not live there. I hear the planes everyday just like you, it&#039;s NYC and we live next to an airport, it&#039;s loud, that&#039;s what supposed to happen..<br /><br />Has anyone outfitted there apartments with any type of sound proofing? Because my elderly neighbor above me has her TV blaring every waking second of the day. I already brought her cookies to no avail..

				Maybe you are right, hfm. But i&#039;m happy they are doing it, all of them, together. It&#039;s a sign we were heard. Being on a Sunday might bring even more audience (esp.

				Prepare yourself starting at 22:00 tonight until noon Sunday. I guarantee starting around 10 or 11 we&#039;ll get the few planes we usually hear on Friday night, then 06:00 Saturday morning the onslaught will begin. It&#039;s 13/31 that always causes it.<br /><br />Runway 13/31 will be closed from 9/25/15 10:00 PM to 9/27/15 12:00 PM for runway safety area, electrical, and maintenance work, subject to air traffic control needs and weather conditions.

				That&#039;s a very good definition: feels like a suspense film. We need to consider what to do on the day of the town hall meeting if it remains quiet till there, or if they say &quot;ah, don&#039;t worry, it was so bad because we had some construction...&quot;<br /><br />A few questions that come to mind:<br />- if LGA renovation goes forward, it should take a few years to be finished. How long should it take? How will that affect noise over our heads? <br />- How many Saturdays like Sept 26 (today, perfect silence) should we expect to have per year?<br />- Can you create a better channel to communicate clearly why the noise is happening and how long it is going to last?<br /><br /><br />

				i think our best bet is to go at the overall loosening of noise restriction/increase in flights at just about every major airport in the country. yeah, it sucks for us. big time. but it sucks for the people near JFK, the people near so many airports. rather than micromanage our problem (which is a problem), we should ponder strength in numbers. surely there are community groups in other areas facing similar issues.

				Wow. Every other weekend that this has happened it&#039;s been runway 13/31. I guess they postponed the maintenance for some reason. There is a disclaimer in there at any rate. Perchance due to UN / Pope? Makes zero sense, but shrug.

				Yes well, EVERY day since last weekend the planes have been landing over our house (73rd and 34th ave) so, they may not affect some, but they are still driving us mad over here.&nbsp; Every 90 seconds every day for the past week.&nbsp; We went to open houses in other neighborhoods this week.&nbsp; I think it is time to go for us. <br /><br /><br />

				Yes, Quentin...I walked to Home Depot during the week...and did notice the terrible noise from planes landing in the early 70&#039;s streets.<br /><br />So, basically it&#039;s either planes taking off...bothering the streets higher up or planes landing destroying the quality of life in the streets lower down.<br /><br />This is what I feel like...the neighborhood...is constantly under attack by planes these days... I understand your impulse to leave...yes, the FAA and LGA, by their lack of any consideration, seem hellbent on forcing folks...if they have options... to flee Jackson Heights.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				There was indeed construction on runway 13/31 this weekend. But while pretty much every other weekend that this has happened planes have taken off over Jackson Heights, this weekend they went the other way on runway 4/22 and took off over Rikers Island (seems like a better plan to me).<br /><br />Does anyone know when this weekly construction is slated to end? I notice that all of the other runway construction (at JFK, Newark, etc.) is always just a few hours over night--not 10pm Friday-noon Sunday.

				We should push for more information about what&#039;s being done and how long it will take. Something that is clear (the text on this website http://webtrak5.bksv.com/panynj4 with reads like gibberish). I need to know which flight paths are going to be affected and, as a result, which areas around the airport will be pounded. Like: &quot;LGA will close runway 13 and flights from 10 am to 6pm Saturday. Flights will take off above Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst and Elmhurst. These neighborhoods should expect increased noise.&quot;<br /><br />We should ask the politicians to push for a limit in the number of days the noise can happen per year. For example, ask for a maximum of 10 bad Saturdays per year, and limit the hours to between 10 am and 6pm. Another option is to ask that it be done on weekdays.<br /><br />One question I&#039;m very interested: if LGA is renovated, will that cause similar runway closures? So, does that mean we&#039;ll have four years with noise every day (or every weekend)?<br /><br />Also, we should ask them to install a grid of noise monitors so we can track noise independently. This will help predict, inform and hold FAA and Port Authority accountable.

				I checked the web site for Oct 13 6pm.&nbsp; You just need to follow these airplanes. There were a lot of airplanes that flew in the area of Elmhurst, and these airplanes kept flying to Flushing, and Whitestone and made a U-turn over long island sound and then over Bronx and then landed at the northern runway at LGA. It is quite a journey for these airplanes. I don&#039;t understand why these planes can fly directly over long island sound and then landed at LGA without having to disturb too many neighborhoods. The good thing for this type of journey is that most Jackson Heights residents were not affected by the airplane noise.<br />

				Thank for the clarification about Garden City. This airport noise thing is such a mess...affecting so many folks....over such a wide area...I see it will only be solved when plane noise reducing technology kicks in or they move the airports miles and miles away....or they start using vertical take off rockets instead of planes. In 100 years folks will look back and laugh at our discomfort. We, of course, will be dead.

				I was there today.<br /><br />Our electeds are 100% on this issue. Den Dekker said that the Runway 22 takeoffs make the plates in his house rattle. Crowley kept holding the FAA and PA&#039;s feet to the fire.<br /><br />The PA says takeoffs should be back down to pre-April levels at the end of November. The two construction projects were the problem, but one of them (resurfacing) happens only every 10 years and the other (safety pads) is a one-time deal. When confronted about why they can&#039;t start at 8am on Sundays, he basically just blathered and sounded like a jerk.<br /><br />It turns out new planes will be quieter than slightly smaller, older planes, oddly, because of new engine technology currently being mandated. However, our electeds are working to keep the distance cap so nobody tries to bring in more long-distance flights. We&#039;re also supposedly getting more noise monitors in the area for Webtrak, although it looked like the PA guy wanted to weasel out of that too.<br /><br />We always have one crazy person at a JH town meeting, wouldn&#039;t be one without it, this time it was a lady yelling &quot;Jet fuel! Cancer!&quot; at a random point. Not that there aren&#039;t safety concerns involving jet fuel, but screaming out disconnected words in the middle of a meeting isn&#039;t the way to go about raising them.<br /><br />It was concluded that we should keep complaining relentlessly, because that&#039;s how we get noticed.

If you ever want to refer to WebTrak for a particular plane noise event, you need to do so within about a 10 minute window after you observe the flight.<br />

				I guess I was unclear.

Why can&#039;t you start at 8 AM?&quot; basically nailing the PA guy to the wall and getting him to admit that he doesn&#039;t want to start the work at 8 AM because he cares more about getting it done quickly than about our ability to sleep.

				Guys! The Mayor of Toledo has solved our plane noise problem!&nbsp; (I thought this was a parody at first but it&#039;s not, what the hell!)<br /><br />MAYOR SUGGESTS MOVING DEAF PEOPLE NEAR LOUD AIRPORT<br />AP , Associated Press<br />Nov. 5, 1994 5:40 AM ET<br />TOLEDO, OHIO TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) _ Despite criticism for suggesting that moving deaf people near an airport would cut down on noise complaints, the mayor says it&#039;s a workable idea.<br />&#039;&#039;I said something like, &#039;You may chuckle, but this may be an idea worth exploring,&#039;&#039; Mayor Carty Finkbeiner said Friday. &#039;&#039;And I haven&#039;t changed my opinion.&#039;&#039;<br />Finkbeiner said he didn&#039;t mean to be disrespectful or insensitive. &#039;&#039;I didn&#039;t say that it was a good or bad idea. My only words were that it was an interesting idea.&#039;&#039;<br />The agency that operates Toledo Express Airport has been buying up nearby homes because jet noise exceeds government standards.<br />Earlier this week, Finkbeiner said deaf people might not be as bothered by the noise and raised the possibility of offering them homes that others are fleeing. He said a citizen had suggested the idea in a letter.<br />&#039;&#039;That&#039;s like saying let the blind work at night because they can&#039;t see,&#039;&#039; said Dave Wielinski, chairman of Barrier Free Toledo, a group for the disabled.<br />Delores Lisac, a deaf woman, called the mayor&#039;s suggestion an insult. She said deaf people can feel the vibrations from jets.

				Having thought about this issue for a while now, my belief is that the FTA etc simply lies to diffuse any community tension...concerning the matter...and proceeds to bombard us with noise regardless of what the politicians or council members or whoever says.<br /><br />My thought is that the only thing the FTA may be concerned about is their &quot;image&quot;. It definitely doesn&#039;t care about our community&#039;s well being, and we would be gullible fools to think it does.<br /><br />And so the only hope would be an attack on the FTA (for their health damaging effects on us)... through the media...<br /><br />If the NY Times (or a news report) would present an article documenting the horror of the conditions we must endure on weekends...and also during the week now...the FTA might take notice. Only because it makes them look bad.&nbsp; NOT because they care two hoots about us, let me add.<br /><br />This is my conclusion after following the progress of this terrible situation for a while now.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				the only reason i can think of not to do it between one and six AM, the (admittedly too short_ hours when the airport is closed is that construction/skilled workers get paid far more to work third shift than first shift. as far as weekends, perhaps there are more flights that would be displaced M-F? that&#039;s just a guess.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=13152.msg67822#msg67822">Quote from: jasonic on December 12, 2015, 03:56:44 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Still don&#039;t understand if this is do to with construction as they said, why not do the construction at night when the airport is closed or at least NOT early am weekends where people are tying to sleep after a long week&#039;s work.

				Agreed. It&#039;s always runway 13/31. It&#039;s been getting work from Friday 10PM to Sunday 12PM for a very long time on most weekends. I&#039;m sure the weekend is the best time to do it is the reason it&#039;s happening (I was also guessing traffic volume), and there isn&#039;t much they can do for the departing flights to not pass over our neighborhood with that runway out of commission. <br /><br />I hate it as well, just trying to come at it from a place of rationality. I&#039;m just at this point where I&#039;m thinking, how long does it take to do all the maintenance? This wasn&#039;t happening much at all for the first 3-4 years I&#039;ve been here, just recent years.<br /><br />The official notice:<br />&quot;Runway 13/31 will be closed from 12/11/15 10:00 PM to 12/13/15 12:00 PM for runway pavement work, and electrical maintenance work, subject to air traffic control needs and weather conditions.&quot;<br /><br />

				Indeed - thanks for reminding me that I wanted to submit a complaint for Saturday the 19th, which I just did. I&#039;m really trying to make a complaint, whether by internet or by phone -&nbsp; EVERY time the airplane noise is disturbing (which, for me, is generally when it starts early or goes late). I feel that the volume of complaints could actually matter to Port Authority and have some kind of helpful impact.<br /><br />As a reminder, you can file a complaint online at:<br /><br />http://www.planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9/<br /><br />or call it in at the Port Authority airport noise complaint hotline:<br />1-800-225-1071<br /><br />It takes a minute or two.<br />

				I thought the airplane noise was supposed to decrease significantly after the end of last year.&nbsp; We have already had several Saturdays with airplane noise and now tonight it is constant.&nbsp; Does anyone know why?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t look like there is a runway closure at LGA tonight.&nbsp;

				<strong>Plane Damages Runway While Landing at LaGuardia: Sources</strong><br /><br />A plane landing at LaGuardia Airport blew out a chunk of concrete on the runway as it was coming down, and flights are now backed up as crews try to repair the runway, airport sources say.<br />Runway 31 is closed as workers try to repair the hole, about 8 feet by 2 feet, sources say. That leaves just one runway open at the airport. <br /><br />Departing flights were delayed over an hour. Arriving flights were delayed about a half-hour. <br />Neal Buccino, a spokesman for Port Authority, which oversees the three New York City-area airports, said a pilot on a departing flight noticed the damage shortly after 3 p.m. and reported it. <br /><br />http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Plane-Blows-Out-Concrete-Runway-LaGuardia-Airport-Flights-Backed-Up-371589601.html

				I imagine there are many factors to take into consideration when deciding how to take care of routine maintenance.

				Ok, Sunday was bad. The planes started early - around 6am and lasted until 2am. There were literally planes flying overhead - taking off from LGA - at 1:30am (6/6 at 1:30-2am, so I guess this early Monday morning). I stood at my window and watched planes climbing. At 1:30am. Because the planes woke me up. I get that flights were probably delayed during the day during the storms &amp; heavy rains, but flights taking off at 1:30am and flying THAT low over a residential area at that time is really unacceptable. <br />And to the folks on here who say to just move - no. I&#039;ve been in JH 6 years. The planes have only been this bad in the past year or two. It wasn&#039;t this bad when we moved here. If we knew that we were in a direct flight path of LGA - which you would expect if you were in Elmhurst closer to the airport - that would be a different story. But this is getting absurd.

				I can&#039;t stand it either, but I&#039;m sure that if they could send the planes over some other path safely and efficiently they would definitely do so to stop the complaints. We live ~1 mile as the crow flies from an airport, it&#039;s just going to happen when runway/taxiway maintenance needs to be done. Hopefully it ends at soon when they are done with the rework. Is there any idea about when the ETR is for these maintenance windows?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s happening from 06:00 Saturday until 06:00-12:00 Sunday due to less air traffic on weekends. Most likely this is also contributing to it taking so much time since they have to wind up the maintenance project and wind it down over the course of basically 24-30 hour windows. Probably also why they can&#039;t just do it from like 1AM-5AM, not a long enough window to actually get anything done.<br /><br />Expecting it to end because we&#039;re complaining, that&#039;s just a pipe dream if there&#039;s no other option. Try going over to the plaza where Petco, RiteAid, and Cannelle are during the day. I don&#039;t know how those people can stand living there with the planes landing over that strip all day. In an ironic twist, it appears looking at google maps there&#039;s a Lexington Hearing and Speech center catercorner from that plaza to the Northwest. I wonder if &quot;can you hear the planes&quot; is part of some testing strategy there.

Why not do it during weekday when most people are at work. All these complaints seen to fall on deaf ears and I&#039;m sick of it.

				In case this inspires you, this is what I&#039;m asking these pols to do:<br /><br />1. Demand a very clear study of how the planned LGA expansion will affect plane noise in Northwestern Queens; create a clear, early and effective channel of communication.<br /><br />2. Demand a $1 fee from every passenger using LaGuardia to be invested in quality of life issues in the neighborhoods that bear the brunt: Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Woodside, Flushing and Corona. If we will bare this noise, I want pristine parks, pristine schools and pristine public transportation infrastructure.<br /><br />3.

				My ears straight up hurt if I went outside this weekend. Felt bad for my kids. Was fine after they switched from takeoffs on 22 to landings on 4 mid-day Sunday. Really, the landings are no big whoop, engines are nearly off, just a low, tolerable roar. I think takeoffs from 22 (the southbound runway that throws them over JH) should be prohibited.

				and when repairs move to one or the other of the runways, they usually last a few weeks -- meaning we are likely to get a break (and, for 22, at least, put the bulk of the noise over the waterfront neighborhoods of the bronx, i believe).<br /><br />if the work has moved, perhaps that means this round of repairs is complete, which could make life more pleasant for a while.

Absolutely we do.<br /><br />We are a major world hub.<br /><br />We should be very careful to not enable LGA to be that airport. <br /><br />Because eventually, not far in the future, there will be planes in the air hovering 24/7...wanting to land in NYC.<br /><br />And are we still expected to accommodate them 24/7?<br /><br />Shelby2 is right. One day, magically, the curfew will disappear...due to &quot;planes hovering in the air 24/7&quot;...<br />LGA is being expanded...NYC needs a 24/7 airport...it&#039;s a good idea for us to be vigilant and not &quot;enable&quot;.<br /><br />

				in all seriousness, i think LGA is third most likely, if that is to happen.<br /><br />in order to turn either of the others into round-the-clock operations, all the port authority has to do is flip the bird to residents (and win a decade or so of court fights).<br /><br />in order to do the same for LGA, the agency would need to put in tens of millions (at least) in improvements beyond what they&#039;re doing already -- i haven&#039;t looked lately, but i don&#039;t think there&#039;s quite enough runway lengthening/alteration to allow the biggest planes to land, and if you can&#039;t fully utilize the facility, why bother? i may be wrong about that last part, please correct me if i am.

				The budget for the renovations of LGA is in the billions.<br /><br />Tens of millions is a drop in the Long Island Sound.<br /><br />From my reading, it appears that the FAA is not transparent when it comes to altering airports.

				not arguing any of those points.<br /><br />arguing that, if NYC does get a 24-7 airport, it won&#039;t be LGA. it would take additional billions to acquire and condemn properties needed to make the airport runways accessible for the biggest planes. and another 10 years of construction.<br /><br />at JFK or EWR, you keep the lights on for a few more hours and add a shift on the job front.<br /><br />are there any stateside airports open 24-7 now? i can&#039;t think of any in the lower 48

				By the way...for clarification those noise contour maps I referred to previously...are to show areas who can apply for money for sound mitigation.<br /><br />We are not within the sound contour map.<br /><br />Thus we here in Jackson Heights will always have to &quot;suck it up&quot; concerning plane noise.<br /><br />And never be compensated for it.<br /><br />Also I have no idea what they doing to the runways...with all these &quot;repairs&quot; every w/end. With all I know they well could be extending the runways...and not telling us.&nbsp; <br /><br />That seems to be their previous modus operandi in other airports around the country. I repeat they operate with NO TRANSPARENCY.

				they would have to double the length of the runways -- the one that occasionally puts takeoffs over our homes is 7003 ft x 150 ft and the dimensions needed for handling heavier, 747 and larger planes, would have to match JFK&#039;s, which are 13,000 feet x 200 feet and 15,000 feet x 250 feet. we&#039;d notice a runway being extended by a mile or more, since it would extend outside the airport grounds.

				I simply don&#039;t trust these Authorities.<br /><br />Based on their previous actions with other airports and the problems they cause which must then be &quot;sucked up&quot; by neighborhoods after it&#039;s too late.<br /><br />I am also suspicious that in the report...a noise monitor on 78th Street/34th Ave was removed once it started reading that airport noise was greater than surrounding ambient noise.&nbsp; (That means they would have had to pay noise mitigation for us)<br /><br />So instead, my guess is that they removed the monitor.&nbsp; No readings. no problems...for them.<br /><br />In the report they say the monitor was requested to be taken away by a &quot;home owner.&quot;<br /><br />All very dodgy.<br /><br />Also... who&#039;s to say the runway can&#039;t be extended into Long Island Sound...? Doubled in that direction...<br /><br />Many other airports have built runways over water...and actually looking at a map of the LGA runways that would be a perfect solution to elongate them.<br /><br />

				QuietSkies.net representative suggests sending the letter below to federal elected officials --<br />* * * <br />Dear ,<br /><br />As you know the Senate and House may soon pass an interim 2016 FAA Re-authorization Bill. At present there are House (H.R. 4441 ) and Senate ( H.R. 636) bills which must be reconciled to a single bill and passed by both houses. <br />These two bills have provision that, in a perfect world, might be sufficient to get us on the road to fair and safe noise&nbsp; levels for those of us on the ground. Unfortunately we don&#039;t live in that perfect world and many sections of the bills are simply &quot;feel good&quot; phrases that relate to greater citizen input to airspace changes. There is no requirement to change the threshold from 65DNL to 55DNL or to any other value for that matter. And, as we all know, if the noise threshold is not changed then, with or without citizen involvement, the FAA will have no motivation to make needed changes. <br />The only section that comes close to helping us get meaningful and potentially safer noise levels is Sec. 604 of H.R. 4441 which states:&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />SEC. 604. Aircraft noise exposure<br /><br />(a) Review- The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration<br />shall conduct a review of the relationship between aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports.<br /><br />(b) Report<br /><br />(1) In general- Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report containing the&nbsp; results of the review.<br /><br />(2) Preliminary recommendations - The report shall contain such preliminary recommendations as the Administrator determines appropriate for revising the land use<br />compatibility guidelines in part 150 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, based on the results of the review and in coordination with other agencies&quot;<br /><br />[Note: An exact copy of SEC 604, with proper indentation, is available]<br /><br />Please do what you can&nbsp; to keep Sec. 604 in the final bill.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br /><br />-- <br />&quot;The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States<br />to promote an environment for all Americans free from<br />noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare.&quot;<br />NOISE CONTROL ACT of 1972 <br />&lt;&lt;&lt;

				Like I keep saying I don&#039;t trust these Authorities.<br /><br />It appears that the language in the document of the bill above is so vague and waffling that it can mean anything.<br /><br />But mostly, to me, it seems to mean that the ADMINISTRATOR of the FAA is in charge of everything.<br /><br />And the FAA, I believe, is on the airports&#039; side.&nbsp; And not on the side of an airport&#039;s surrounding neighborhoods. <br /><br />

				In the past, the FAA has taken ZERO notice of people&#039;s complaints.<br /><br />Not only that, in their press releases, they minimize and invalidate our concerns.<br /><br />It is a delusion to believe they will take us into consideration in the future.<br /><br />They do what they want.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t that obvious by the bombardment of noise we have to suffer?<br /><br />My guess is, they will scrap that perimeter rule and one day the rule simply won&#039;t be there...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Live on 6th floor @83rd street &amp; 35th. Can see the planes landing and taking off, it&#039;s quite a spectacle. On the noise front, when they land we don&#039;t hear anything, when they take off it&#039;s noticeable but largely bearable. No sound wave or apt shaking here. My guess is that this an issue mainly for people living in early 70s street.

				Last Sunday was my breaking point.&nbsp; Having diligently written down the days the planes have taken off over us since last October, I decided to write to the Port Authority&#039;s Community Relations person.&nbsp; You may recall we had a local meeting on airplane noise in October 2015, which is where I met him.&nbsp; Below is his response to my email, which follows his....&nbsp; We will see if anything changes.&nbsp; Thought you all should be aware of the PA&#039;s response.<br /><br /><br />Daniel<br /><br />It is good to hear from you.&nbsp; Thank you for contacting me regarding&nbsp; Runway 22 Departures at LGA.&nbsp; &nbsp;With respect to the referenced flight activity over Jackson Heights, please know&nbsp; that LGA Operations works closely with the FAA Tower to minimize utilization of Runway 22 for departures to the extent possible, taking into consideration quality of life concerns of the local community.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; certain wind conditions occasionally necessitate the FAA’s determination to use this Runway for departing flights (even when we are not implementing construction).<br /><br />Last October, I did have the opportunity to brief you and members of the Jackson Heights community on 2 key projects that we were completing in 2015.&nbsp; As advised, both the Federally mandated safety areas and paving and milling of Runway 13-31, were successfully completed in 2015.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, there&nbsp; have been additional closures of Runway 13-31 due to the rehabilitation and construction of the high speed taxiways connected to Runway 13-31. Please note that while construction crews work diligently to complete the taxiway work in a timely manner, weather conditions which dictate the construction schedule, have sometimes been an impediment to this goal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, weather permitting, the completion of the taxiway work is scheduled to be completed by Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Please know that construction work is critical in order for us to meet and surpass all FAA regulations.&nbsp; Although, additional weekend closures will occur down the road, I do not anticipate any further closures of Runway 13-31 for the remainder of the Summer.&nbsp; &nbsp;If this changes, I will alert you.<br /><br />I understand your frustration and encourage you to file noise complaints either via the&nbsp; Port Authority’s toll-free phone&nbsp; number, 1-800-225-1071, or at the following link on our website: http://www.planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9/qs114wbt.php.<br /><br />Please also feel free to contact me if I may be of any further assistance on this matter.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ian<br /><br />Ian R.

				Thank you, Jhlifer, for initiating communication. I have followed up with the Port Authority to ask directly what, if any, construction projects are upcoming. The Port Authority has known about this taxiway project since at least 2014 (the plans can be found online), so I think we need to push for much more transparency.

				In TRYING to DECIPHER the info...they seem to be relying on the updating of plane models to lower noise.<br /><br />My guess is that this will be like waiting for the MTA to upgrade all subway trains.&nbsp; <br /><br />We still have subway cars running that were built in the mid 1960&#039;s. <br /><br />And so it will be with airplanes.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				FYI...Via the Freedom of Information Act....<br /><br />http://queenstribune.com/data-supports-airplane-noise-concerns/<br /><br />NB. A 7-fold increase for plane departures over Jackson Heights.<br />Plus LIES from the FAA.<br /><br />That is the truth of the situation we HAVE&nbsp; and ARE facing. <br /><br />The FAA is an agency who clearly can&#039;t be trusted when it comes to the plane noise situation.<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s ok now.&nbsp; But when it starts up again, let&#039;s be SMART and AWARE of the duplicitous nature of the FAA.<br /><br />(As proven by the document via the Freedom of Information Act obtained by the Queens Quiet Skies organization.)<br /><br />Knowledge is power.

				Since we were not in the area this morning my husband showed me how to go back in time on that flight tracker (http://webtrak5.bksv.com/panynj4 in the &quot;Flights&quot; panel on the lower left: click the &quot;Historical&quot; tab and then allow it a minute or two to adjust to that time). <br /><br />I was absolutely shocked at some of the numbers I quickly tallied. There were exactly 30 take offs this morning between 8am &amp; 9:20am?!? After that I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. Each one went over those two sensors on 78th. One near 34th ave and the other between 25 &amp; 30 aves.<br /><br />So I can skip reading the previous 32 pages of this part 2 airplane noise thread, can I ask for some stories of how you all have learned to cope with this ongoing problem? Do you check that website every Friday night and close all your windows, put on white noise and put in earplugs? Get up early when things get noisy and leave the neighborhood for the day? Can anyone please give me some hope that I will be able to cope with this problem?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

The only times I open them are when I&#039;m outside for the day and I want a little air circulation for my orchid. <br /><br />2) I wear earplugs when I sleep - in addition to black-out shades and the Alaskan Bear sleep mask. When I&#039;m not sleeping, I have them on around 75% of the time when I&#039;m home. I purchase a box of Peltor No-Touch earplugs, and it lasts a long time as they are durable and can be washed and reused. <br /><br />3) For really dire situations, I wear the Peltor Optime 105 over-the-ear earmuffs. I purchased this years ago when I used to live in an apartment with a noisy upstairs neighbor. The combination of the earplugs and earmuffs cut down a significant amount of noise that you can possibly hear. <br /><br />The earplugs I don&#039;t mind wearing all the time, but the earmuffs are tiring so I only use them when absolutely necessary. This combination is decent against the airplanes, but it&#039;s definitely not a cure-all because the engines are so powerful. It also depends on close to your particular building that the planes are flying over. I have it on my nightstand if I happen to want to use them. <br /><br />4) Try to get outside as much as possible on the weekends. Hiking, sports, run errands, hang out with family and friends. <br /><br />Obviously, it sucks that we have to alter our lives due to this issue, but the best way to deal with it is to surrender to the fact that it&#039;s happening, and do everything possible to focus on what we can control. Other than protesting and informing our local politicians, the above are the steps that I personally use to do that.

				http://panynjpart150.com/LGA_FNEM.asp<br /><br />Here&#039;s the final report.<br /><br />Examining and analyzing it is pretty complicated.<br /><br />From what I can gather the noise will increase around 70th Street to over 65 decibels which is all that is indicated.<br /><br />So...does that mean the rest of us will hear 50-60 decibels?<br /><br />Which is the sound of light traffic to normal conversation.&nbsp; In other words there might be a constant sound of noise up to the loudness of normal conversation. All day long.<br /><br />Or only that level... say to till 75th Street where it might taper off?<br /><br />Can someone who&#039;s into reading/understanding these reports make an educated guess and let us know what we&#039;re in for?<br /><br />Thanks...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				i have only a cursory familiarity, but it *looks* like the brunt of things will be shifted slightly west, with 70th at the epicenter, and the waves arcing out in both directions - so that the mid to high 60s and lower 70s will be impacted most.<br /><br />there are a lot of digressions about historical structures and the like, but the legalese on that front eludes me.

				While it might not be that useful to complain on here, I don&#039;t think that a complaint to Port Authority is a bad idea. If they get enough complaints on a weekend like this, it might remind them that we don&#039;t want to put up with this noise on any kind of regular basis. It sometimes worries me when I see big plans for the renovation of LGA that there could be some change made that sends the planes over us like this frequently.

				Please remember that there are two projects happening at LaG.<br /><br />First is the major rehabilitation of the whole airport.<br /><br />Second is the renovation of the current runways that are in use.<br /><br />So, complaints are good to keep the pressure on the Port Authority. But I doubt anything can be done to reduce the fliy-overs until the total rehabilitatiion project is complete. I also think that the horrible humidity that we have had this summer both keeps the airplanes lower and keeps the noise contained in the area.

There are two runways at LGA, that can each take off in either direction. That leaves 4 directions planes can take off and land from: NE, NW, SE, and SW. It&#039;s the SW approach that flies right over us. The SE approach flies over Flushing Meadows Park, except during tennis matches when it goes right over downtown Flushing. The NW approach only goes over Rikers Island. The NE approach goes over the water, and the areas it is closest to are industrial, with few residents. That&#039;s why those patterns are used most of the time, because they <em>don&#039;t</em> bother people (or at least not nearly as many).

				Ten years or more there was a Town Hall for the airplane noise over Jackson Heights. At PS 69. At that time the noise seemed endless.<br /><br />One thing I recall clearly, is the experts promised that in ten years airplanes would be quieter. And we would have less worries about plane noise.<br /><br />It&#039;s ten years later. Just saying.<br /><br />I saw that those in charge will say anything to a community...and then do whatever they like.<br /><br />Including implementation of any possible plans for Riker&#039;s Island.&nbsp;
