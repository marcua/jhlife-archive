				Hi - we were really impressed with an apartment (and the building) at 72nd St at 35th Avenue. I know it&#039;s not the historic district, but it&#039;s a lot closer to the express trains - a big plus for us!<br /><br />Does anyone have any thoughts, ideas or opinions on the development (JAC Towers?)<br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />- Marcus

				Wow, no one?<br /><br />For us the advantages are: Close to the E express (and our jobs in Midtown West), near to where the new dog run is supposedly coming at 35th and 69th St. <br />Disadvantages: Outside of the historic district, not as green/pretty as other parts of the neighborhood. <br /><br />Any other thoughts? As someone who&#039;s never lived in the neighborhood (but really likes it, and is excited about moving/owning there) are there other concerns/advantages to that corner of JH that I&#039;m not aware of?<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to reply publicly, you can send me a message as well. <br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />- Marcus<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3020/2730827676_20316712ed_m.jpg)<br /><br />

				Hi Marcus,<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anyone who lives in Jac Towers, but I live at 73rd and 35th.&nbsp; I chose this part of JH over the Historic District for similar reasons as you stated:&nbsp; proximity of the express station, and I like being close to everything.&nbsp; It&#039;s close enough to the prettier streets that I can get my fix of trees by taking a walk.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if Jac Towers is rentals or condos.&nbsp; I&#039;m renting, and found that renting from a coop/condo owner in the historic district would be a bit cheaper than in my managed apartment building - but as they are privately owned they are not rent stabilized.&nbsp; I struggled with the decision (my building vs. historic district) and I&#039;m very happy with my choice.&nbsp; There are tons of exits from the express train, so you can live anywhere up to 80th Street and still have a really short walk to the train.&nbsp; <br /><br />This part of JH is very safe (well, I think all of JH is safe). The only downside is street noise - lots of honking and the infernal racket by my arch-nemesis, Mr. Softee.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s exclusive to this part of JH - from reading this site I realize it seems to be an issue all over the hood, including the historic district.&nbsp; I got used to it pretty quickly, and the fan on my a/c really helps block out the noise.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks - the building is a co-op. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t notice much street noise when I was there (Sunday, early afternoon, Wednesday morning) - is 35th Ave loud? It seems like there&#039;s almost no traffic on 72nd St. <br /><br />Thanks, <br />-Marcus

				I never knew anyone who lived in this building but I am in the area frequently.&nbsp; 72nd street between 37th and 35th avenue is a fairly quiet block by Jackson Heights standards.&nbsp; 35th avenue is a busy street but not terribly noisy.&nbsp; If your windows face 35th avenue you may pick up some traffic noise.&nbsp; You are very close to the heart of the South Asian shopping area (37th avenue from 72nd-75th and 74th street between 37th and Roosevelt Avenues) which is always busy.&nbsp; Legends Sports Bar and Barbecue are around the corner on 35th avenue at 71st Street.

				Thanks, all - the more time we spend in the area, the more we like it. And the business of the area immediately around the 74th St. stop doesn&#039;t bother us - we currently live two blocks from Times Square. I like busy streets and dense and diverse shopping areas - as long as my home is just a little removed from the action, it&#039;s great. <br /><br />And, yes, the unit we&#039;ve looked at does face 35th Ave, but the traffic didn&#039;t seem bad (I&#039;m on 9th avenue in Hell&#039;s Kitchen now - that&#039;s awful traffic - every night trying to get out through the tunnel - and the bar crawl nightly is getting really loud and really late - especially in the last 5 or so years)<br /><br />I&#039;d certainly welcome any more thoughts on the area (or updates on the dog park??) but I think we&#039;re moving in the right direction on this one!<br /><br />Thanks, <br />- Marcus

Based on all the listings I had perused, I knew that I could not find a better location: very close to the train station (about two blocks) without being too close, a pretty tree-lined street without a noisy bus route (like 73<sup>rd</sup> Street has), 24-hour businesses in the immediate vicinity (Apna Bazar Cash and Carry, Dynasty Deli, Subzi Mandi and Trade Fair, as well as <em>halal</em> butchers I rarely frequent), and a quiet demeanor despite being near bustling intersections. The only things I donâ€™t like about it are all the noisy, hyperactive children who attend the Daru-l-Furqan Mosque on the block or live in the building next to it and who scream and yell and shriek down the block while their parents ignore them; and the admittedly rare ice cream truck that plays the admittedly amusing â€œTurkey in the Strawâ€ medley mentioned in another thread. (I thought I might escape annoying children by finding a building that isnâ€™t near the local school, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s much worse there.)

				This may be a silly contribution to the thread, but when I used to live on 71st Street right off 35th Avenue, I enjoyed walking up Leverich to take the 7 train at 69th Street rather than using the 74th Street hub.&nbsp; Less people, peaceful walk and less platform crowding.&nbsp; The only part of the walk I didn&#039;t like so much was crossing the Broadway and 37th Avenue intersection.&nbsp; With all the recent improvements that have been made to the highway entrance though, crossing has become much easier.

				My sister and her ex lived on the top floor of that building from 1982-1992. It was a huge 1 bedroom with an amazing view of Manhattan. Their apartment had a fire escape inside a door that ran to the basement of the building if memory serves me correctly (no exterior fire escape). Also had roof access. I remember the building being spotlessly clean (no roaches) with a great super whose name I think was Bob. When the building first went co-op the apartment was selling for only 18K, imagine that? Of course like so many, they didn&#039;t buy it! The mindset was who buys apartments, you save for a house. Talk about a bad credo... What it&#039;s like now is unknown to me these days. I don&#039;t remember a parking garage but I may be wrong. Nice tree lined block.

				That was our impression too - the unit we&#039;re looking at doesn&#039;t have the Manhattan view (it&#039;s on a lower floor, facing 35th Ave), but is also big, bright and roomy. All the common spaces looked spotless to me as well (elevator music in the elevator, squeaky-clean floors in the basement area) - it&#039;s nice to hear that it&#039;s been very well maintained for a long time! <br /><br />I also found out that a coworker lives in a building across the street on 72nd, and also loves that little pocket of the neighborhood. <br /><br />Thanks!<br />- Marcus

I can ask the seller of the apartment we&#039;re buying. We&#039;d originally started looking up in Washington Heights (we work on 54th and 9th in Manhattan) but didn&#039;t like what our money bought us up there. A friend who grew up in Linden Court (and still lives there) suggested we look out in JH, and we fell in love. <br /><br />We&#039;ve actually been looking hard all summer, working with our broker - he spotted this listing in the MLS services, and even though he couldn&#039;t attend, we went to the first open house, and made our broker go back the next business day. As soon as we walked in, the place just felt &#039;right&#039; (and huge - and nicely renovated). We&#039;re putting 20% down - I don&#039;t know if this building will accept a lower amount - we didn&#039;t ask. <br /><br />We&#039;d made offers on other units in the neighborhood&nbsp; - just about every building that allows bigger dogs - we saw. And we&#039;ve often lost out to all-cash offers or dropped out over the asking price. (And one place we were informed that we didn&#039;t make enough - they had a maximum of 25% mortgage+maintenance to income ratio - and for us that building would have been 27%)&nbsp; We made our first offer in early May, and are just so happy to have gotten this far.&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;d love to do a September get-together - I&#039;ll keep an eye out for the date!<br /><br />Thanks for the welcome messages, all!<br /><br />Best, <br /><br />- Marcus<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3153/2796531271_71b0ca7ca9_m.jpg)

Youâ€™re off to a sensational start. The code flickr provides you by clicking where it says â€œEmbedâ€ is perfectly fine under normal circumstances, but this bulletin board is not set to allow the necessary h.t.m.l. tags to embed the video. Linking to it is just as good.<br />

				So we&#039;ve finished scrubbing and painting - and I took one last round of photos before we moved in - no more pictures until we&#039;ve unpacked (nothing like a pile of boxes in a room to ruin the mood, eh?)<br /><br />Still, we&#039;re thrilled to have such a nice home to live in. We moved over the weekend - we&#039;re exhausted - but happy. The cats and the puppy keep going from room to room (they&#039;re not used to more than one living space!) and we can&#039;t wait to get fully settled. <br /><br />We scrubbed and repainted every surface (ceiling, walls, trim) and then ripped up the old wall-to-wall brown carpet that had been installed in every room. The whole process took slightly longer than we thought, but it&#039;s finally done. <br /><br /><strong>Living Room</strong><br />Before<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2730014271_c6a0b1b08e_m.jpg)<br /><br />After<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3269073181_c9390c1584.jpg)<br /><br /><strong>Bedroom</strong><br />Before<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/2730852926_770042e7ab_m.jpg)<br /><br />After<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3446/3269084905_947d1028df.jpg)<br /><br /><strong>Dining Room</strong><br />Before<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/2730847132_0c8d0e11ce_m.jpg)<br /><br />After<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3269897952_6d26b696a0.jpg) (http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3432/3269074975_d2b922603e.jpg)<br />(I can&#039;t seem to quite capture this red/gold accent wall)<br /><br /><strong>Kitchen</strong><br />Before<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3090/2730848456_3152c10715_m.jpg)<br /><br />After (not much change here, really)<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3321/3269065977_7facc9f3c0.jpg)<br /><br />Full set is on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcuswoollen/sets/72157613575450159/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcuswoollen/sets/72157613575450159/)

				Hi Marcus<br />A big welcome to the neighborhood...<br />I like the Jac Towers as well, I own a couple of apartments in that co-op, has done for many years now...<br />Only thing, compared to many other co-ops in the neighborhood, the maintenance is a bit high...<br />Just curious, what unit did you buy/ the big 2BR on the 1st floor???<br />Hugs :)

				Heals &amp; Stockings: No, I think that the big 2BR on the ground floor is still available. We bought a JR 4 on the second floor that faces 35th Ave (and the bedroom is on the back corner and also faces the alley in back where the fire escape is). <br /><br />I think that the maintenance varies by floor - we&#039;re OK with it on the 2nd floor, although I believe from other listings we&#039;ve seen in our research of the building that it&#039;s higher on higher floors (with city views). It&#039;s money well spent as far as we&#039;re concerned, as the building is spotlessly maintained, and the financial statements made sense to us when we reviewed as we were buying. And for other large pre-war elevator buildings, it seems in-line with others buildings in the area. <br /><br />Mark, Todd and Marlene - thanks for the compliments! We have some more furniture on the way, but once we&#039;re done, I&#039;ll post some fully-furnished photos.<br />

				We&#039;re getting there - after driving back from Virginia at night during the bizzard two weeks ago, and slowly unpacking and putting things away, we&#039;re nearly done settling in. There&#039;s still a few boxes that need to be unpacked, and a few items cluttering up our bedroom that need to to to the salvation army, but it&#039;s feeling like home now!<br /><br />For those that are interested, the full renovation before/during/after gallery (with notes) is at http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcuswoollen/sets/72157613575450159/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcuswoollen/sets/72157613575450159/)<br /><br />Living Room<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3437/3387151345_2866699a11.jpg)<br /><br />Dining Room<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3387965694_73515a054e.jpg)<br /><br />Hall<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/3387967146_8d7f320e3e.jpg)<br /><br />Kitchen<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/3387969450_7ee7c487dd.jpg)<br /><br />Bedroom<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3387653759_a62a0b4982.jpg)

				I found the board members that I met with to be relaxed, normal people.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t feel that any of the questions were overly intrusive or invasive. By the time we got to the board interview, the management company had already given a preliminary OK to our finances, so the board meeting was just a get-to-know-you meeting - we actually enjoyed it. The building has a nice friendly vibe to it, and everyone I&#039;ve met here seems proud of the building, and cares a great deal about keeping it a nice place to live.<br />

				I don&#039;t know exactly which unit you&#039;re looking for, but I know of 2 for sale in the building: a 1BR on the 5th Floor: http://cesargarcia.listingbook.com/cgi-bin/websites/templates/booklets_red/prop_detail.php/?mlno=2149104&amp;uid=A27855&amp;node=37 (http://cesargarcia.listingbook.com/cgi-bin/websites/templates/booklets_red/prop_detail.php/?mlno=2149104&amp;uid=A27855&amp;node=37)<br />and a two bedroom on the ground floor (elevated by nearly a full story on the outside): http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/reo/1093515366.html (http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/reo/1093515366.html)<br />I&#039;ve been in the 2BR and it&#039;s huge and beautiful. I&#039;ve not seen the 1BR, but it looks like the same kitchen renovation that went into our unit, which was very nicely done. It&#039;s in the back, and the building behind ours is only 4 floors, so it should have a nice open (but quiet) view.
