				To know what is at stake, read this news story and watch the video. Just today a protest was led in another IDC members district and the video shows real parents, not press releases, talking about how the IDC cut deals with Republicans to underfund schools.<br /><br />http://www.fios1news.com/lowerhudsonvalley/families-call-on-sen-david-carlucci-to-fight-for-us-in-protest-over-school-funding-vote#.WNQ9OhiZO9b

				honor-mosher, <br />I was very surprised when this accusation against Peralta began to percolate, and found it hard to believe, because to anyone who knows Peralta and his voting record, it would be a complete betrayal of his principles and constituents for him to vote against this aid to our schools.&nbsp; So I poked around and looked into this.<br /><br />If there were actually a bill on getting Foundation aid to our District&#039;s schools that came to an up--and-down vote, and Peralta voted against it or walked out and didn&#039;t vote, I would be furious and this march would be justified. Mainstream Democrats want us to believe that is what happened, as part of the unfortunate internecine clawing and scratching going on between Democrats and the IDC. But I don&#039;t think that is what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;If I&#039;m wrong, forgive me in advance, but it&#039;s my understanding that this was a vote involving a &quot;hostile amendment&quot; presented by Senator Kevin Parker on a bill for a training program for coroners. The action on this amendment can be found here, starting at about 10:18: https://www.nysenate.gov/calendar/sessions/march-13-2017/session-3-13-17<br />&nbsp;<br />According to Senate rules, you&#039;re not supposed to introduce amendments that are irrelevant to the original bills.&nbsp; At 10:28, the Chair rules that the amendment is &quot;not germane to the bill and is out of order.&quot;&nbsp; Then Parker goes into an impassioned defense of his amendment (the substance of which, I presume, Peralta would agree with wholeheartedly)&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, at 13:47, the Chair calls for a &quot;procedural vote on the ruling of the Chair,&quot; which was that the amendment was &quot;not germane.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;The vote was on the procedural ruling, not the substance of the bill. It&#039;s not clear if Peralta &quot;walked out&quot; or if any IDC people raised their hands in support of the ruling.&nbsp; &nbsp;What I do know is that this kind of thing happens frequently if hostile amendments are introduced by both Repubs and Dems.<br /><br />Did Parker introduce the amendment knowing full well that it was going to be over-ruled, in order to embarrass the IDC into a procedural vote that would make them look bad?&nbsp; That&#039;s what the IDC people say.&nbsp; They also claim it is part and parcel of the ongoing Democratic&nbsp; strategy to introduce &quot;hostile amendments&quot; to make them look bad. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s true. I do know that this issue is now being used as a mobilizing tool against the IDC, whose budget did call for more school aid.<br /><br />So what we have here is (probably) an example of political smoke and mirrors by both sides, and voters are being manipulated by both sides. Later, the IDC introduced its own budget with good things, including increased school funding (probably knowing the Dems wouldn&#039;t vote for it). Sure enough, the Dems didn&#039;t vote for it, and then the IDC blamed the Dems for not voting for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I wrote on another thread, I say, &quot;A plague on both their houses!&quot; This infighting among people who agree on most things is sapping progressive energies. Both mainstream Dems and the IDC are guilty.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t want the community to get &quot;played&quot; by clever politicians, and I fear that is what is happening with this Foundation aid issue.

				This is not infighting - this is calling out representatives who are Democrat in Name Only. Please do not condescend by saying that I am being manipulated by anyone.&nbsp; If you want to have a political discussion then have one without that nonsense.<br /><br />&nbsp;If Peralta and the IDC are supporting a budget that gave the same amount of Foundation Aid as the GOP budget to public schools and only half of what the Democrats proposed then he is siding with the GOP.&nbsp; Yes, Cuomo gives nothing in his Executive Budget.&nbsp; Demanding that our democrats get in line and vote with their own party is not sapping progressive energy - it is creating a solid progressive agenda.&nbsp; If New York can&#039;t be a true blue state then we are lost.&nbsp; And if you are arguing that other branches of our State government are holding things up - please look at the list of legislature that the assembly has passed and is just languishing because it doesn&#039;t get introduced to the floor because the IDC and Felder have given the majority to Flanagan.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t we see the Sanctuary State go the floor? Why don&#039;t we see Women&#039;s Reproductive Health Act on the Floor?<br /><br />

				honor-mosher,<br />Sorry. I should not have implied you were being manipulated. That was wrong, as you are obviously well-informed about educational funding. <br /><br />&nbsp;However, I do fear that mainstream Democratic leaders are trying to manipulate the community by focusing on and misrepresenting what was a procedural vote.&nbsp; As for the amount of education aid in the IDC budget, I agree completely. It wasn&#039;t enough.&nbsp; I am not a reflexive defender of Peralta or any of his colleagues, just someone who knows something about the dreary world of Albany.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Many families with children in public schools are not aware of the<strong> 2006 Campaign for Fiscal Equity vs. State ruling</strong> that the State must pay out 5.6 Billion dollars to public schools for operational costs so when the IDC supports a budget that does not support this court ruling parents should be complaining and marching and finding a representative who will support a budget that funds a court mandated payout to their schools.<br /><br />From the brief - <br />&quot;More than a decade ago, we held that the Education Article of the New York State Constitution requires the state &quot;to offer all children the opportunity of a sound basic education&quot;(Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, 86 NY2d 307, 316 [1995] <br />[CFE I]).&nbsp; Plaintiffs had sought a declaratory judgment against the State, claiming that students in New York City public schools were not receiving a basic education and that the State&#039;s public school financing system is unconstitutional&quot;<br />

				I fully understand the implications of the hostile amendment. Mainline Dems did this for symbolic reasons and guess what?&nbsp; The IDC failed the symbolic test.&nbsp; They can claim all they want that they support progressive issues because their allies the Republicans will never let most of these bills leave committee and go to the floor.&nbsp; The IDC could come out publicly today and say they are in support of a bill that would give all New Yorkers a free car, knowing full well they only gain support of liberal New Yorkers with no political fall out.<br />And as someone who voted for Peralta twice and has signed petitions for his support, I find it telling that he promised us that nothing would change in terms of his votes in the Town Hall he held in February.&nbsp; And now we see that he is voting as he is required to by Jeff Klein, who must vote in a way that pleases the Senate Republicans.&nbsp; He is compromised and we won&#039;t let him get away with it.<br />Sure if Peralta wasn&#039;t an IDC member we wouldn&#039;t be bothering him about his walk out.&nbsp; But he made the choice to join the conference that literally exists to power-share with the Senate Republicans.&nbsp; He claims to gain nothing from it but I guarentee that he is waiting for the big money no-work &quot;consultation fees&quot; that Senator Ortt from Niagara Falls just got indicted for.&nbsp; He sold out his constituents for so little.&nbsp; <br />

I have yet to hear that Senator Peralta has broken any laws nor have I heard that his office doesn&#039;t work. <br /><br />I do not see how bringing down an elected official, who represents a diverse district with broad views and experiences, who has done decent/good/excellent job in a system of dysfunction and corruption. <br /><br />In order for the Democrats to gain the majority, Democrats need to stop preaching to the choir, get out of our comfort zones and campaign in Republican districts, and have serious conversations with them. <br /><br />Drawing lines hasn&#039;t helped. Maybe some bridge building, and stop with the walls. <br /><br />Senator Parker who introduced the &quot;hostile&quot; amendment, did it for the optics, knowing he wasn&#039;t allowed to introduce such a bill due to procedures, his intention was to embarrass/shame IDC members, knowing there could be no vote, while understanding that the general public wouldn&#039;t understand what happened. <br /><br />Senator Parker stoked the flames, to upset people, people he currently can&#039;t help. <br /><br />What we the people need, is for Democrats to focus their attention on Republicans, not on Independent, Green, Libertarians, or the Independent Democratic Conference. <br /><br />Perhaps if I sound rude, it&#039;s because I&#039;m dismayed with government and community reaction. I prefer proaction, and a government that actually moves forward in the best interest of life on earth.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Statement from State Senator Jose Peralta: <br /><br />A few weeks ago, the mainline Democrats engaged in a outrageous public relations stunt designed to spread misinformation and confuse the people who care most about this issue. A hostile amendment is not a vote for Foundation Aid funding, it is a vote on whether or not an issue is relevant to a bill it is attached to — and the Senate Democrats deliberately selected one that had nothing to do with education. By the numbers this was a political game made to fail since the GOP holds a majority, but furthermore since Foundation Aid contains fiscal implications the Senate Democrats know it is a matter being handled in the New York State budget due April 1.<br /><br />I have supported the Campaign for Fiscal Equity throughout my legislative career. <strong>It is offensive to the core for anyone to say I voted against CFE funding</strong> when no such vote occurred. <em>We vote on a budget on April 1</em>.<br /><br /><em><strong>I support $1.4 billion for Foundation Aid</strong></em> with a phase-in in this year’s budget. I have always fought for building more schools to add more seats and&nbsp; eliminate decades-old classroom trailers that are not conducive to a real learning environment for our children. I pushed hard to obtain a record-setting amount of bond money to help our local schools. <br /><br />In the 13th Senate District <strong>my advocacy has led to new nine schools with 4,693 seats and four new schools with 2,871 seats</strong> that are in the pipeline to alleviate the severe overcrowding. For the mainline Democrats to pull this public relations stunt for the purpose of trying to deceive my constituents is very sad.

				Its great when Senator Jose Peralta posts a random comment, because it really helps to see how ridiculous his positions are when they are in black or white.<br /><br />1) Senator, which one is it ? You tout that you helped deliver thousands of school seats in the last 13 years, yet you also said you abandoned the Democratic party because you couldn&#039;t get anything done and you needed to have a coalition with Republicans, so how did you pull that off being in the Democratic conference for the last 13 years.<br /><br />2) Senator, which one is it ? You attack the Democrats for proposing a budget that fully funds NYC schools because the Senate Republicans wont vote for it, but you said by joining the Republicans you could get them to vote for things they didn&#039;t want to vote for.<br /><br />3) Senator, which one is it ? You attack you&#039;re constituents who showed up to you&#039;re Town Hall and are now calling you out on education funding as being outsiders and agitators, but now you say its the Democratic conference thats actually behind all the criticism against you.<br /><br />4) Senator, which one is it ? You now say that there is no working Democratic majority so you joined the Republicans to make things happen for you&#039;re constituents, but the proposed budget has less funding for NYC schools than LI and upstate school, there is no Dream Act, no GENDA, no campaign finance reform, no rent protections, and no clarity on Raise the Age.<br /><br />Senator, which one is it ? Now we all know which on it is. You&#039;re a Republican. <br /><br />

				thedude,<br /><br />In an earlier thread, I earnestly requested that you stop making stuff up and be more careful,&nbsp; and you promised that you would &quot;stick to the facts.&quot;&nbsp; But you just posted claims you either made up out of whole cloth or based on exaggerations of the truth. I think facts and nuances matter. So, even though my family thinks I am absolutely nuts to spend time on these responses, I&#039;ll point out a few of your alternative facts:<br /><br />1) thedude: &quot;You tout that you helped deliver thousands of school seats in the last 13 years, yet you also said you abandoned the Democratic party because you couldn&#039;t get anything done...&quot; He never said he &quot;couldn&#039;t get anything done.&quot;&nbsp; He was proud of what he was able to deliver to his constituents.&nbsp; He did spell out a lot of big agenda items that couldn&#039;t get off the ground, and mainstream Democratic tactics as well as the votes of conservative Democratic Senators failed to get them off the ground.<br />2) thedude: &quot;You attack the Democrats for proposing a budget that fully funds NYC schools because the Senate Republicans wont vote for it.&quot;&nbsp; Please provide evidence that he or the IDC attacked the Democrats for doing this.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find any.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t, then you&#039;ve made it up. If you can, I apologize in advance.<br />3) thedude: &quot;You attack you&#039;re constituents who showed up to you&#039;re Town Hall and are now calling you out on education funding as being outsiders and agitators, but now you say its the Democratic conference thats actually behind all the criticism against you.&quot;&nbsp; Agree that it was a bad idea for the IDC and Peralta to say that about constituents who protested. But that does not contradict his assertion that the mainline Democrats used political shenanigans by misrepresenting a procedural vote. One had nothing to do with the other.<br />4) the dude: &quot;the proposed budget has less funding for NYC schools than LI and upstate school, there is no Dream Act, no GENDA, no campaign finance reform, no rent protections, and no clarity on Raise the Age.&quot;&nbsp; You seem to be discussing the Republican Senate budget. The IDC put forward a separate budget that included most of those policies and provisions. I&#039;m not especially fond of Jeff Klein, but his press release spells those out: https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/jeffrey-d-klein/independent-democratic-conference-releases-historic-budget.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />These budgets are essentially negotiating positions and votes on them do not change State laws&nbsp; It&#039;s disappointing that the IDC couldn&#039;t get the Republicans to include at least a few of these items, but the proof of the pudding will come during negotiations with the Governor.&nbsp; When that happens, despite all the fingerprinting engaged in by both sides, I presume Hastie (Democrat from the Assembly) and Klein will actually have the same positions on almost everything. Let&#039;s see what happens.

				I&#039;m sure Saturday&#039;s march raised the hackles of Peralta&#039;s supporters, but I&#039;m very glad and thankful to everyone who participated. It&#039;s so important to show that constituents have clear expectations and that we intend to hold our electeds accountable for meeting them.<br />It sounds like the moment of truth is the budget vote on April 1. I abhor the tactics and agenda of state senate Republicans, but let&#039;s be real--the Democrats haven&#039;t exactly earned our unflinching trust and loyalty, either. As far as Senator Peralta is concerned, the budget vote is when we&#039;ll know if his move to the IDC could hold any benefit for the community.

				While I hate to stand in the way of a good &quot;Peralta/IDC&quot; conversation, I do have some questions about school funding.&nbsp; It&#039;s my understanding that NYC spends more money per pupil than any other large city.&nbsp; Yet I have many friends who are teachers that tell me they have to pay for their own classroom supplies.&nbsp; That may be a small thing, but is it an indication of a larger problem?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be provocative, I just want to know what my neighbors think.&nbsp; I work in a bureaucracy that is larger than the NYC public school system.&nbsp; Sometimes the problem is money, and sometimes the problem is people believe money solves all problems.&nbsp; Are we throwing money at a system that is structurally flawed?&nbsp; How well served is our community, with so many non-English speaking students, by a system that puts so much weight on standardized tests.&nbsp; Does New York City need to rethink how we teach our students?&nbsp; If the answer is we need more money, great.&nbsp; But if we get the money do we walk away and expect that the current system will work?

Let&#039;s call all their bluffs.<br /><br /><strong>The Senate leadership determines which bills get voted on.</strong><br /><br />IMO that is the issue people need to understand before deciding what to do with their&nbsp; Senator. There is no point in putting pressure on your Senator to vote a certain way on a particular bill, if the bill that you really want is never put up for a vote.
