				My 23 y/o cat has disappeared. Either squeezed thru the gate, or went in the yard to be left alone....If anyone sees a orange colored cat, half blind, matted and misssing teeth, ( but otherwise in good shape) Please leave a message here. A huge reward is being offered. She went missing last night, on 86th between 34th and 35th.&nbsp; Not that she would hear you, but her name is Harlow

				Great news!! I know with my girl (who was around 20) she started getting dementia and would try to leave the house and go back and fourth to the litter box and food bowls forgetting what she was doing.
