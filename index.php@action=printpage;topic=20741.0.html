				So this is what the NYC DOT has come up with for 34th Avenue as presented to Community Board 3 last Thursday evening. While I don&#039;t love it, I can live with it, which probably means all the car-haters will thoroughly reject this plan.<br /><br />You can read the details and see some diagrams here:<br />https://jacksonheightspost.com/dot-unveils-plan-for-34th-avenue-in-jackson-heights-includes-pedestrian-plazas-and-car-access

				Actually, this is kinda what the DOT is beginning to implement around Union Square.<br /><br />And, well...it sort of works there. And looks pretty cool aesthetically. <br /><br />So even though I would&#039;ve loved a LINEAR PARK...this plan is ok by me. <br /><br />In particular, Travers Park is somewhat expanded for pedestrians...and other areas too...which is great.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I say...HOORAY!

				&nbsp;Hearing about legal requests for buyouts from the city along the lines of what they do when a new school gets built close to someone&#039;s existing home*. Maybe 34th Ave residents can request a legal settlement for the change in circumstances. I imagine some folks are impacted negatively and could receive compensation easily in court, like those losing their garage or business accesses along the avenue. <br /><br />*I think the payouts for recent schools here have been three houses in from the construction sites and some voice on the construction hours, etc. DOT must have something similar?

				I have asked our Councilman whether the DOT has assessed the increase in traffic, congestion and noise that is now prevalent along 35th Avenue and likely Northern Boulevard especially beginning in the mid-afternoon through about 7pm.&nbsp; Now that cars and school buses have to contend with double-parked trucks and cars on 35th Avenue, as well as the Q49 bus, we have hours of congestion, noise, and danger to pedestrians.&nbsp; So while the DOT has calmed 34th Avenue, it has made 35th Avenue that much more treacherous for about five hours each weekday.&nbsp; With 34th Avenue no longer a through street the traffic has and will go to alternate east-west avenues... it will not simply disappear.&nbsp; What is their solution to the creation of additional noise, congestion, pollution and danger on 35th Avenue?&nbsp; What can/will the DOT do about this???&nbsp;

				The plan looks like a fantastic compromise.<br /><br />And that&#039;s what everyone was dreaming of. A compromise.<br />Neither side gets fully what they wanted.<br /><br />Hooray for fairness! <br /><br />Surely everyone can see that a black and white closed/open situation is not considering what others in our community want.<br /><br />Thankfully human nature is able to incorporate others&#039; viewpoints in a democracy. <br /><br />God Bless America. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				So to summarize, as I understand it:<br /><br />34th is permanently closed to thru-traffic, but cars can still circulate and access all buildings.<br /><br />Open streets continues part time, with moveable barriers.<br /><br />The closer half of the street is permanently converted to pedestrian plaza in front of Travers and each school, making those blocks one-way.<br /><br />Corner bumpouts on every corner.<br /><br />A few blocks are permanent &quot;shared streets&quot; with additional traffic calming measures and lower speed limits.<br /><br /><br />All seems pretty good, to be honest. I wish every corner in the city had those bumpouts. Cars recklessly turning is the by far the biggest danger to pedestrians.

				&nbsp;Starting on 69th street, some have more than one entrance but use 34th Ave. The bowling alley, the pool hall, the various doctors offices, the various small tradesman that use 34th ave facing garages, the supermarket on 91st? and many other small business people for whom front door access - or lack there of - is an impediment to their business. Though they are not businesses per se, the public schools have a tremendous amount of vehicular traffic with deliveries and most of faculty driving from elsewhere. Many South Asian drivers live/work in the lower 70&#039;s too.<br /><br />&nbsp;We should include those blocks that are adjacent whose rear alleys have turned into speedways for those ducking the barriers on 34th. This includes the block between 71st and 72nd which has a number of small business owners which is an issue for their livelihood is they have storage or repair businesses there. Many people work at home now and since 34th is mostly residential, a number of people are making their livings in their homes which often necessitates street access, medical drop offs and the like. These people have probably not been counted as against as they are too busy just working to speak up but the NY1 segment on our supposed &quot;gold standard of Open Streets&quot;, gave the commentator an earful, live, on how they felt about the closure which was interesting to see. Love the suggestion of port-a-potties and trash cans on side streets so they can share the love!<br /><br />&nbsp;ALSO - 34th Ave residents are now subject to very early sanitation pickups and all hours food truck groceries deliveries which can often be soo loud!<br />

				Hey Itsit, glad to see you are supporting the DOT plan and joyful about the solutions they have come up with. <br /><br />It is marvelous that so many folks are celebrating the benefit the Open Street will bring to one and all. <br /><br />Excited about the future of 34th Ave and the wonders of it for us all. <br /><br />It&#039;s great how you dreamed of a compromise and here it is.<br /><br />Kinda like magic. You helped so much with this compromise. Thank you! <br /><br />

				&nbsp;Actually, I do like this compromise because as Jason from DOT has often said they go through so many incarnations or tweaks to really work. So this is flown out as a first pass and we get to say a lot about it. The schools will be a big factor in my opinion as teaching over honking is hard to do! But let&#039;s see what flies and we&#039;ll all keep talking. And it seems like it may shrink from this plan based on usage and other factors. Like today was a very light day on Open Streets and it&#039;s technically still October.<br />&nbsp;That&#039;s compromise, eh?

				Lots of things to keep in mind:<br /><br />1. this is a proposal and not a final plan<br />2. Even with these changes the French barricades will continue and that makes it non-compliant with the ADA.<br />3. The building across from the schools on the avenue will not have disabled access as the plazas are closed to all traffic<br />3. There have been no surveys - no traffic impact on 34th and esp. not on 35th, Northern and 32nd<br />4. There has been no environmental impact studies - esp. on the other avenues<br />5. There has been no real residents survey - only a brief online survey that was open to anyone (not just residents). We have asked for a door-to-door survey - paper survey to be signed by the resident. 34COMPROMISE has volunteered to join this process to verify the veracity.<br /><br /><br />There well be further presentations following this and finally a vote and more until anything happens.<br />Nothing is planned until the Spring 2022 or later

				DOT said they wanted to reduce the reliance on volunteers to move the barricades twice a day. Then proposed diverters that drivers could simply drive around to easily access 34th Avenue for several blocks, making the Open Street not very pedestrian friendly, which DOT also said would probably mean the barricades would have to stay. Come again? <br /><br />The barricades were an imperfect temporary solution fine for an emergency. We need design choices that limit cars to local traffic only, that keeps the space safe and inviting to pedestrians, and allows local drivers incapable of moving a heavy barricade access to the street to park, drop off/pick up, etc. This isn&#039;t it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">like those losing their garage or business accesses along the avenue.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />FYI, nobody is losing garage or business access.

				&nbsp;What a contentious project! Really needs a long review by professionals with lot&#039;s of data because this plan is not what satisfies both parties who live/work/go to school on 34th Ave. It may be possible this was just put out to start a discussion and is far, far from anything that could be considered permanent. The Broadway to Northern Blvd. divided bike lane was installed and lasted about two weeks last year when it was demolished by traffic needing that space.

But the volume of construction vehicles, trucks and cars of all types is so high in that area near the BQE that it was knocked over and then smashed to bits very quickly. These plastic dividers don&#039;t hold up in high traffic areas. Concrete is fine by me but the loss of traffic lanes when biking is not as common here or as feasible in winter months means that the surge goes elsewhere and creates new headaches on a different street. We desperately need a full environmental review for the area. The fact that some of the blocks affected here also had major flooding recently and that is not being recognized shows that it&#039;s not one size fits all for our local streets and any closures or bike lanes. Sunnyside is strongly fighting back and we&#039;ll see how they fare with regard to unusual forced street closures and bike lanes.

				5 miles per hour is absolutely pointless on a bike unless you aren&#039;t actually going anywhere. And as a serious biker, I might be in the minority feeling that more bike accidents are caused by stupid bikers than by stupid drivers. E-bikes and dirt bikes should be regulated all over the city, it&#039;s true.. but it&#039;s also true that from the very first week of Open Streets, I took my bike there thinking it would be awesome and realized that it had just become a dangerous slalom course.

				LOL. This preoccupation with Ayn Rand is hilarious. Where does that even come from? A human powered bicycle rider should not have to get a license to ride their bike. Since when have pedal bicycles become such a health hazard? Who gives a crap about Ayn Randian philosophy w/r/t these issues? We want helmet laws for bicyclists? Make cops pull over every bicycle rider and ticket them. How about hand signaling laws for turning? Maybe a rigorous bicycle test for bike license holders? Can we see how many new laws and regulations we can create for the police to ignore?

				The greatest factor in whether one is an open street/ linear park supporter is how someone feels about who gets to use and have access to public space.&nbsp; If you think that cars, by default, have the right to an enormous amount of public space, then it&#039;s likely you will not support the OS.&nbsp; If you think that public space can and should be used for things other than car transportation and car storage, then you will likely support and enjoy the OS.&nbsp; I live right on 34th and I think the OS is the greatest.&nbsp; The most vehement anti-OS person lives almost two blocks from the OS and has driveway.&nbsp; The fact is that there are about 40 people who hate it and are very vocal about it.&nbsp; The OS is demonstrably popular and is heavily used by wide swaths of the community.&nbsp; Clearly there are people who hate it, but it&#039;s also pretty clear that an enormous amount of people like and use it.

I&#039;m glad YOUR friends love Open Streets, but perhaps living outside one&#039;s own little fantasy world is what makes New York New York, for me at least. Talk about solipsism!</sub>

				Is that your way of saying &quot;it takes one to know one?&quot; Well I respectfully disagree. I want Everyone, and I truly mean EVERYone, to use 34th.

				&nbsp;The difference between anyplace in Manhattan and the outer boroughs is easy transit options for all ages and mobility. Many people here in JH are in need of some kind of transit- car service, delivery of goods, school buses, company vehicles, etc- to live their lives. The 12hr -NO WAIT 13 HR!!- closures are not conducive to those on 34th Ave, and now the immediately surrounding residences to having a quality of life that they did prior to Open Streets. Sounds like the legal challenges are, in some cases, requesting payouts similar to those with the school construction sites to nearby residents affected.<br />&nbsp;Even today, on a Sunday, there were times in the 13 hours with little to no usage. Also the chaos that is motorcycles/e-bikes/speeding cyclists in the free for all on 34th Ave, is losing appeal to many of those who were formerly fans of OS. And while we are at it, bring back the bike lane, say many! Restore sanity with a designated bike lane, the kind we used to have for decades prior.<br />&nbsp;Does Transportation Alternatives support losing our beloved 34th bike lane? If the &quot;whites on bikes&quot; who are said to be pushing OS in other communities aware of this loss? Let&#039;s see what the winter brings with usage and this spring DOT construction if it happens. Nothing can be worse than Diversity Plaza when it comes to local planning here. Or maybe we can hit a new<br />low...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

It&#039;s a link to an article about the proposal. The actual proposal is within a .pdf file you can download from https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/34th-ave-open-street-cb3-full-board-oct2021.pdf (https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/34th-ave-open-street-cb3-full-board-oct2021.pdf).<br /><br />It&#039;s 43 pages so take some time to ensure you understand everything within the proposal.<br />My concerns were the reduction of time (which as far as I can tell has been increased to 24 hours) and the need to move the barricades. The only way it seems to me that this will be addressed is if parking is prohibited along 34th Avenue.&nbsp; This will most likely force car owners to engage in a non-stop search for parking or to fork over several hundred a month in the off chance they can actually find a parking space to rent. It says nothing about the current traffic mess on Northern Blvd, 35th and 37th Avenues and even 32nd Avenue during rush hours. It also doesn&#039;t mention whether the reduction in accidents and injuries were simply moved to other streets. I hope I&#039;m reading this incorrectly.

				Sorry, it looks like maybe half the parking is retained. The diagrams show parking spaces up into the chicane on each block. I would expect much of this to be changed once the residents find out their parking spots are mostly going away. I also wonder how they&#039;re going to handle double parked cars and delivery vehicles paring in front of the diverters, similarly to how they park in the intersections currently.

				&nbsp;Oh yes, I&#039;ve been here all along. And the Diversity Plaza renovations were hijacked by a group purporting to represent the whole community- all of JH, commuters, residents, business owners and non-business owners- should have been part of the planning. But it did not end up being representative of the community at large in my opinion. The business community took over. Was it worse before the millions were spent? Not every one thinks so. The cars were a problem, yes, but the traffic only got thrown to one side - the right hand side headed towards Roosevelt- creating a weird traffic area there.<br />&nbsp; Also the lack of thru traffic has some shady business going on with more sex traffic and suspect businesses that were not there before. It&#039;s a shame because at one point not that long ago this lower end of Jackson Heights seemed to be a promising retail and restaurant area. The block on Roosevelt between 73rd and 72nd seems to have taken the hardest hit.&nbsp; There are some fine restaurants sprinkled in but the area as a whole is seedier now than I have ever seen before. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What might be a solution? There needs to be a diverse group of businesses, I think, that will have a variety of clientele and different merchandise and be open staggered hours. A cafe that has a good handle on its outdoor seating, smaller kiosks in an organized fashion would be nice. Near Madison Park on 23rd street in Manhattan, the city has done a good job of limiting the food vendors and have places to sit and throw your garbage which is cleaned often.The trash and garbage collection on 73rd is awful now and worse than before the traffic changes. This is a fear for 34th Ave too because changes making vehicular access more difficult tend to result in reduced services for all. The rat scene at Diversity Plaza is unreal!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry, not progress in my opinion and all that money just for raising the sidewalk to the level of the street? Why? And for gods sake let&#039;s not let that hijacking happen again. Collect<br />data, feel the temp of the whole neighborhood post Covid and see what consensus and professional planners can deliver.

				Itsit, I am simply far more optimistic about Jackson Heights and Diversity Plaza and the Open Street and New York...and life... in general. And not interested in downward spiraling negative thinking and catastrophizing. To deal with that way of existential being, which is called anhedonia, folks should go into therapy. <br /><br />What we have in this neighborhood and city is to celebrate and be thankful for.<br /><br />Hooray for the DOT proposal.<br /><br />And here&#039;s to a great future.<br /><br /><br />

				Following this issue has been a fascinating lesson in human nature.<br /><br />When folks don&#039;t get their way, they resort to making up negative facts.<br /><br />Do these folks really believe that anyone will fall for those fabricated negative facts?

While I am for local parking permits, I would also be for city wide permits for contractors and teachers. At least right now I think I would. My mind could be changed. Something I notice is that in the mornings, locals who need their cars for work leave before 8 am and there&#039;s a lot more flex in the street parking available. And we want teachers and contractors that have to use cars to get to work early to be able to park without getting tickets. Ideally I&#039;d like mass transit to be improved enough that a teacher living in the Bronx could commute using mass transit to Jackson Heights and spend a max of 45 minutes door to door. Until that happens, I think we should be thinking of teacher&#039;s parking needs as legit needs for the members of our community that teach our children.

				&nbsp;Am looking at Sunnyside and their attempts to put these diverters in. Today was a disaster with a tractor trailer stuck in the narrow streets around the Doughboy park snarling traffic and the DOT construction crews - in every direction. Really god awful traffic with people driving in reverse up the streets and on the sidewalks. People should think long and hard here on the impact to the entire neighborhood. Skillman Ave is the wrong ave to change and I think 34th is not the best choice here but let the planners present their assessments post Covid.<br />&nbsp;As for teachers parking in JH - yes, it&#039;s extremely important and should be a high priority but the DOE should participate in the local planning. They have built a number of new schools with next to no parking accommodations for facilities that educate 7,000. kids! Why not have the lottery system that many schools do? BTW Cambridge is one of many popular urban areas that needed to resort to parking permits for locals along with a bunch of other in Boston and Phila and DC that I am aware of.

				&nbsp;Thanks Lochezia! Just back from the woodshed - do you know this term? Or the wonderful book<br />by a former JH Towers resident and stellar painter, Jack Whitten*? It&#039;s where you do the ruminating<br />and thinking and reforming of ideas after having them percolate for awhile in your head. One thing<br />that I can&#039;t figure out as I pass it on 34th ave at the 69th Street BQE overpass is a new bike rack.<br />This is a god forsaken area and no one in their right mind is parking their bike in this bird crap laden<br />area! But we know the DOT are not savvy about lower JH and have made some utterly ridiculous <br />statements like there are no bike lanes anywhere around here...hello 31st Ave beautiful bike lane.<br />&nbsp; So a new bike rack for the Open Street group, I imagine, a few yards from the other two bike racks<br />in front of the new school (which are barely used) and sadly, no bike rack for IS230 a few blocks up <br />the street! What gives with these people? Please explain the random bike rack dropping, someone?<br /><br />&nbsp; *https://shop.hauserwirth.com/products/jack-whitten-notes-from-the-woodshed

				&nbsp;So ABCD...,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that your final answer? Much appreciation for the bike rack here in the underpass of 34th Ave and 69th St ? Personally, I think a walk 3-4 blocks up 34th ave to IS230 which has bikes on every tree and fence around the school and no bike racks would been a better use of resources. That&#039;s just me.<br />(http://)<br />

				haha, that random rack is city planning at its finest.. meanwhile, kind of a light day on the Closed Street this afternoon, and it&#039;s beautiful out! But, of course I still had trouble riding my bike at full speed due to people blocking the bike lane or stepping into it from between parked cars without even pretending to look for bike traffic in the bike lane.

				&nbsp;Was it Socrates who said the unexamined life is not worth living? No harm in looking at our surroundings and seeing ways to improve. Move the bike rack to where one is needed, not where bikes would be covered in bird crap and close the streets when needed but use sidewalks when few people are out walking, like most of the day in winter months.

				&nbsp;The funny thing about CITIbike coming here is that JH was offered those bikes early on. The opposition was that we have a full bike lane with bike owners using their own bikes for transit and the rental market for closer rides was not here. Full circle, I think it would be <em>great </em>for us to have Citibikes but not in this godforsaken underpass. Near Roosevelt Ave., someplaces on Northern, near the schools and in the denser parts of the community. Not in this sad area under the BQE unless you wanted to clean it up for real this time. BTW this bike rack is almost exactly in the spot where a man passed away in his TLC car and was unnoticed for many days until his family made police do a search. It was a very sad story.

				&nbsp;Exactly!! There is no there there. Nothing. And Citibikes are better used in places where people want to go. Like near amenities or transit. The ones on 31st Ave in Astoria are mostly full every time I see them because that is a more residential area and I imagine most cyclists have their own bikes. Up near Diversity Plaza or on that sad block of Roosevelt between 72-72rd would be great and they already have zipcars there. Placement to desired locations seems critical here and 34th Ave &amp; 69th st. just ain&#039;t that place.

				&nbsp; Ah, there are surveys and then there is reality. Please don&#039;t go to that underpass in the dark! The drug activity has increased significantly with the street closures and local residents are fed up. The massive attempts at clean up in recent years of the area around the overpass are commendable and Jimmy Van Bremer even got the HAZMAT folks there as it was so dangerous. But things got worse over the pandemic and even with so many one off Community Clean Ups on 69th street, the area is still very dirty and problematic. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Citibike can apparently put their bikes wherever but the ones I see in Woodside on 31st Ave and near the Habitat store are seldom used as there are many fewer residents there and these are not popular destinations in the area. Vs. mostly empty Citibike stations in Manhattan and here in Queens, near transit or popular dining areas, because many people are using them as transit alternatives.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;An analysis of where use is high vs. random placement is sure to come but why do this odd location to begin with? With the new data collection plans, we can finally access how many people even go beyond the lower 70&#039;s on 34th Ave and if the bikes would much better placed for the neighborhood in the Historic District. But oh no come the shouts, not the Historic District. If we can put up street dining, Citibikes along 37th and on Northern Blvd make much more sense.Because 69th street is actually the edge of Woodside and no one cares that much from either neighborhood about it&#039;s future. Sad but true. Put bike racks where they are needed and will be used please! Cease and desist with random bike rack droppings. <br /><br />note- This forum serves as a place for back and forth discussions on issues large and small in JH. It will be missed!

				<br />It&#039;s a bit dramatic I admit but the point is sound; even when the closed street is not being used, one still cannot actually ride a bike on it. And... 5 mph on a bicycle?! You come on. That&#039;s pathetic, and any motorized scooter or delivery cart ain&#039;t doing that anyway. Jogging can even be faster than 5 mph. And in the &quot;bike lane&quot;&nbsp; just as annoying.<br /><br />Also, in addition to a heavy duty Kryptonite lock and spare tubes/tires, make sure you have disinfecting wipes and a spray cleaner (for urine) after unlocking your bike at that overpass. That is, if it&#039;s not under 6 feet of flood water. Hooray for sensible planning!

Anyone who wants to bike to get somewhere quickly can head on over to the bike lanes north of Northern Blvd. They are on a bike, so it won&#039;t take them long to get over there. The eBike delivery guys who use 34th Ave should slow it down or ride in regular traffic. Most those eBikes are practically motorcycles anyway. It would be nice to see the 115 out there regularly to issue warnings. I don&#039;t really want those delivery guys to get a ticket, but I would like them to get the message that they could eventually get one if they continue to break the 5 MPH rule.

				why don&#039;t they just close off the north side of 34th avenue instead of both ways?&nbsp; just allow one way flow of traffic while still maintaining open streets on the other half of the block.&nbsp; i like open streets but making it permanent is a bit much imho.&nbsp; make it from 8-6 - there&#039; no reason it should extend to 8pm every night.&nbsp; there&#039;s a huge park right there to hang.

				&nbsp;Open Streets is a runaway project gone amok and seriously needs trimming. And planning. The hours are too long and even many people who loved it initially are getting weary of the issues. People who live on the Ave include many, many detractors, who are not vocal online, but definitely are not happy with this change of circumstances and want the street back as the only street with decent vehicular traffic flow and a formerly excellent bike lane. In a recent report by Transportation Alternatives, the numbers indicated less than 10% of the city residents are active cyclists. So that&#039;s 90% that are not. And the sidewalks in JH are not so great and could use a serious upgrade. Open the discussions to town halls, local votes(specific) and much more information on who runs, who funds and who to call about 34th ave issues.<br /><br />&nbsp;<strong>Let&#039;s take a good hard look at this project and make sure all parties are at the table whose lives are being affected. </strong>

				Tour de France on 34th, not ok. Scooters/practically motorcycles zipping along at 25 mph, not ok. <br />That doesn&#039;t mean that a regular bicycle has to ride at 5mph to operate safely. There&#039;s plenty of room on the street, and a regular bicycle at 15 mph can stop quickly. <br />Even the tots on trikes go faster than 5 mph. <br />Sure 5mph is the rule, but when the rule doesn&#039;t line up with reality, no one will follow it. Even the responsible riders are not going 5mph, it&#039;s just not necessary to operate safely. <br />That said, the scooter/ebike riders are often reckless and a safety hazard.

				We rank either 49 or 50th out of 51 City Council Districts for available park space in NYC. The district that ranks dead last is located across Fifth Avenue from Central Park. The OS is needed to provide desperately needed open space for our community. And btw, it is for pedestrians, not just bicyclists, as someone above suggested.<br />Don&#039;t think anyone can conclude that most people who live on 34th Avenue are for OR against the OS. Most of the people I know who live there are in support, but we all operate in our own circles.<br />My experience, though is that people who are against something are generally more vocal than supporters and the fact that the anti-34th Avenue march a month or so ago only attracted about 35 people seems to indicate to me that there is NOT a lot of opposition.<br />Not everyone might agree with me, though.

				&nbsp;The silent majority is the opposition on 34th Ave. Mostly working class people who feel that the excessive street closure impacts them more than others. If you live two blocks away, you might feel that open streets is a delightful use of space. But if you asked most of the residents actually living on or right next to the street, it&#039;s like a party that has gone on way too long. Good while it was in full swing, but now it&#039;s time to get back to reality, back to the here and now...<br />&nbsp; Many of those residents are middle class working people, not heavily wired or available for in person protests. But believe me, they have a voice and are using various channels available. It&#039;s not lost on some people that we replaced a packed weekend soccer game with two tennis courts in Travers Park. Or that we have revamped the kiddie playground multiple times whilst we have slim to no senior facilities in the neighborhood. Or that the asphalt at Travers hosted cricket, soccer, girls softball, rollerblading and a host of misc. things which is now an expensive to maintain green mound used far fewer days of the year. I could go on but there are people who live here who think the ENTIRE community should be factored into the 34th Ave decision, not just those most vocal and most networked.

				Was able to locate the actual polling data here:<br /><br />https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CA-mdzanvvxCmde9sbm5tq4j251jGG_-/view<br /><br />Every borough, every age group, every income level, and every race/ethnicity had a strong majority in favor of expanding Open Streets. So did car owners and bike owners. The <strong>only</strong> group with a majority opposed was registered Republicans.<br /><br />Granted the caveat is that this is about the program in general, not 34th Ave specifically. And the poll is from almost a year ago. However, pending any evidence to the contrary, it seems like a pretty good gauge of sentiment. I would be surprised if Jackson Heights was much <em>less</em> supportive of OS than the rest of the city.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Not talking about the two bike racks in front of PS398. Not those. But the one that is so oddly positioned in the underpass of the BQE one block away on the bowling alley side. The school racks are minimally used, usually pink scooters that sometimes spend the weekend there but this one below the highway is absolutely useless. No one in their right mind would use it.<br />&nbsp; Meanwhile, IS230 (several blocks away) has no bike racks, older students, and cyclists chain up their bikes all around the available fences. Does this make any sense to you? Who plans this stuff? Do they just throw darts and put bike racks up wherever?
